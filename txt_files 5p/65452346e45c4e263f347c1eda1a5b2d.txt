1. Expected Utility Theory

3

• Utility = function 

of Expected 
Outcomes (EO)
Final states only

•
• Gambles = 

lotteries

• Certainty 

equivalents

• Concave: 

decreasing marginal 
utility & risk 
aversion

EUT: Risk Aversion

4

 Utility function U(w)=sqrt(w) 
 Choice between:
X
1€

Y
10€ with a probability of .10

 Expected outcome for both: 1€

However,
for w =  1 €, U gives u = 1

EUT: Risk Aversion

Problem 1:

A
4000 with probability 0.80
(EO = 3200)

B
3000
(EO = 3000)

20%

80%

Take both 
times .25

Problem 2:

C = A * 0.25
4000 with probability 0.20
(EO = 800)

D = C * 0.25
3000 with probability 0.25
(EO = 750)

65%

35%

The Certainty Effect

9

Why does this violate EUT?
 Odds for EO are the same in both cases:

3000/3200 = 750/800 = 15/16

 Hence, resulting utility should be consistent with the 

same relation of probabilities.

 Violates substitution (independence) axiom.

Risk aversion for gains; Risk seeking for losses

The Certainty Effect

14

Why does this violate EUT?









Consider again U(w) = sqrt(w).

If you have 10€ and can either 

A) Loose 1 € for sure or 

B) Loose 10€ with probability 0.10

U(9) = 3

U(10) = 3.16 * 0.9 (+ 0*0.1) = 2.84 

 It remains risk averse, as it only considers final states!

Gamble IV

15

Problem 7:
Consider the following two-stage game. In the first stage, 
there is a probability of .75 to end the game without winning 
anything, and a probability of .25 to move into the second 
stage. If you reach the second stage you have a choice 
between 

I: 4.000 with probability 0.80 and 
J: 3000€ for sure.

Your choice must be made before the game starts, i.e. before 
the outcome of the first stage is known.

The Isolation Effect

16

Problem 7:

I
4.000€ with probability 0.80 * 
0.25 (EO = 800)

J
3000€.*0.25
(EO = 750)

Empirical Evidence: Summary

18

EUT fails to account for…
- The certainty effect
- The High- vs. Low Probability effect
- The Reflection effect
- The Isolation Effect

 An alternative account is needed for a descriptive 
model of how people make decisions under risk.

3. Prospect Theory

19

Structure
Two phases of decision making:
1. Editing Phase 
2. Evaluation Phase
 Value function υ
 Weighting function π 

Two scales

Goal
To account for the observed effects.

3.1 Editing Phase

20

Different operations „translate“ prospects depending 
on context and presentation of problem.

Coding
Combination
Segregation
Cancellation
Simplification
Detection of Dominance

3.2 Evaluation Phase

21

Value function
Assigns a subjective value υ(x) to changes in wealth/ 
welfare x. 

Three important properties:
-It has a reference point  distinguishes gains &
       losses.
-It is S-shaped (gains: concave; losses: convex).
-Slope is steeper for losses than for gains.

3.2.1 Value Function

22

Gains: 
Concave

Losses:

Convex & Steep

Reference

Point

3.2. Evaluation Phase

23

Weighting function
Gives decision weight π(p) as a  function of each given 
probability p.

Important properties:
-NOT a measure of believe / probability.
-Leads to undercertainty.
-“Not well behaved at extremes”
-  over-weighting / disregarding of very low probabilities

Prospect Theory

25

Putting it all together - The overall value of a regular prospect:

V (x, p; y,q) = π(p) υ(x) +  π(q) υ(y)

x, y = outcomes
p,q = probabilities

 π(p), π(q) = weighting functions

 υ(x), υ(y) = value functions

29

(Historical) Impact:
 Lead to Cumultative Prospect Theory (1992).

 High impact on psychology & behavioral 

economics.



(Sort of a) paradigm shift from analytical to 
synthetic theory-building in decision making.

 Prospect Theory:

 Editing Phase  Evaluation Phase
 Two scales: value function & weighting function
 Reference point  gains vs. losses

 Destructive arguments agains EUT as descriptive model 

of decision making under risk based on empirical 
evidence.

 Descriptive model for risk
