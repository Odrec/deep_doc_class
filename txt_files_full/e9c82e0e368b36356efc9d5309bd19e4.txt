Emerging perspectives 
on the structure and function 
of attitude strength 

Eaton, A. A., Majka, E. A., & Visser, P. (2008) 

Attitude Definition  

• „A general, relatively enduring evaluation of an object.“ (Petty & 

Cacioppo, 1981) 

• Attitudes are: 
• EVALUATIVE  
• GENERAL  
• ENDURING  
• Specific to particular OBJECTS

AS Definition 

• Attitudes vary in strength  
• Independently of where attitudes lie along an evaluative 

continuum, some attitudes are very firm and impactful and 
others are not 

Strong attitutes

Empirical Impasse 

Example: 
• However..  
• Confirmatory factor analyses of same correlations supported 

different conclusions 

• Latent factor model  measures of attitude importance and 

measures of atittude relevant knowledge were reflections of a 
common underlying construct   poor fit to the data  

 depending on  specific analysis, very different conceptual 
conclusions can be derived from the very same set of 
correlations.

Discussion 

• What are the pros and cons of attitude strength as a unitary 

construct and as a complex common factor  view (latent 
factor) ?

New Conceptualisation of AS 

• Shift how AS is conceptualised shows a number of important 

insights 
• Suggests that it may be time to abandon the notion that AS is a 

construct at all  

• AS = umbrella term  refers in only the most general way to 

multiple

Discrepancies between 
implicit an explicit attitude 
measures as an indicator of 
attitude strength 

Karpen, S. C., Jia, L., & Rydell, R. J. (2012) 

 

Attitude Strength 

Definition (Karpen et al., 2006): 
• Degree to which attitude is resistant to change and influences 

behavior 

• Attitude strength high = attitudes are more stable and more 

predictive for behavior 

• Attitude strength high = no explicit ambivalence or 

discrepancy between attitudes

Experiment 1  

Results: 
• Greater IED towards exercise: 

• Pro-exercise behavior salient = positive exercise related self-

beliefs and positive explicit attitudes 

• Anti-exercise behavior salient = negative exercise self-beliefs and 

•

negative explicit attitudes 
Higher level of IED  Easier to manipulate  Indicates 
weaker attitudes

Attitudinal 
Ambivalence 
 ”Me, ambivalent? Well, yes and no.” — Anonymous 

Mark Conner & Christopher J. Armitage (2008) 

Introduction  

Attitude Definition: 
• „Psychological tendency that is expressed by evaluating a 

particular entity with some degree of favor or disfavor.“  

       (Eagly & Chaiken, 1993) 
     No possibility of positive and negative evaluation 

 

• But not all attitudes are clear-cut  
    Attitudinal Ambivalence (AA) 
 
AA Definition: 
• Psychological state in which „person holds mixed feelings 

(pos/neg) toward object“ (Gardner, 1987)

Conceptual Definitions of  
Ambivalence 
• Attitudes = unidimensional, bipolar constructs         vs.  
               AA = bidimensional, bipolar constructs 
• Many Definitions for AA with common ground: 

• Simultaneous existence of pos & neg evaluation of 

Attitude Object 

• Distinguish AA from: 

• Attitude Variability 
• Attitude Uncertainty

Operational Definitions of 
Ambivalence 
• Lack of consensus how to measure AA 
• Two broad approaches: 

 
 

 
 
 
 

• Felt Ambivalence  

+ Experiences of how unpleasent AA is 
- Open to extraneous influences 

• Potential Ambivalence  

+ Respondent doesn‘t have to combine pos and  
   neg evaluation in a biased manner 
+ Appropriate term for Ambivalence 
+ Separation of pos and neg evaluation

Operational Definitions of 
Ambivalence 
Separation of pos and neg evaluation 
• Split Semantic Differential Scale 
• Ambivalence = (P+N)/2 - |P-N| (Griffin) 
•

(3+3)/2 - |3-3| = 3 
(4+1)/2 - |4-1| = -0.5

Antecendents of Ambivalence 

Top-Down Processes 
• Value Conflict 

• Needing stimulation vs. Needing stability 

• Personality Style 

• High need for cognition  
• High in personal fear of invalidity 

 
 Great involvement as Moderator 
 Mixed support for approach

Antecendents of Ambivalence 

Bottom-Up Processes 
• Attitude Object (AO) 

• Shopping list examination technique 
• Some AO are more likely to arouse ambivalence 

• Societal norms and Social groups 

• Prefering ingroup to outgroup can conflict with 

personal motivation of „fairness“  Ambivalence 
toward both groups

Consequences of Ambivalence 

Ambivalence as a Dimension of Attitude 
Strength 
• AA as measure of Attitude Strength in 

research: 
• High Attitude Strength = Low AA 

• Ambivalence is found to be related to: 
• Low attitude accessibility  and extremity

35 

Consequences of Ambivalence 

Considering AA as dimension of attitude strength, then 
Ambivalence would affect: 
• Attitude Stability 

• High Ambivalence = Low temporal Attitude Stability 

• Attitude Pliability 

• High Ambivalence = High Pliability  

• Information Processing 

• High Ambivalence = Less Information Processing 

• Attitude-Behavior Relationship 

• High Ambivalence = Weak Attitude-Behavior 

Relationship

On the automatic 
activation of 
attitudes 

Fazio, R. H., Sanbonmatsu, D. M., Powell, M. C., & Kardes F. R. (1986) 

Introduction 

• Fazio et al., 1986 
• Indiana University 
• Setting: 3 Experiments with undergraduates 
• Main hypothesis:  Stronger attitudes can be easily activated 

automatically without noticing 

• Experiment 1 – 22 undergraduates 
• Experiment 2 – 23 participants responded to ad 
• Experiment 3 – 18 undergraduates

Presentation of potencial primes  
Fast latency  Strong primes / Slow latency  Weak primes 
Priming followed by target word 
Evaluation of target word (good/bad) 
Facilitation and inhibition measured (latency) 
 

Variation (experiments): Strong vs. weak prime, SOA-time

Results 

• Positive strong prime followed by positive target word = 

higher facilitation  

• Same for negative procedure 
• Effect only by short SOA  automatical process  
• The stronger the object-evaluation-association, the more 

resistant the attitude is to change, the greater is the stability 
and the more likely it is to guide behavior 

• Strong attitudes = highly functional
