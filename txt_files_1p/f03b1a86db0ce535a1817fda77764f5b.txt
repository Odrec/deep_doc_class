Vacuolar-type ATPase (V-ATPase) purified from the
midgut of the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta is in-
hibited 50% by 10 nM of the plecomacrolide concanamy-
cin A, the specific inhibitor of V-ATPases. To determine
the binding site(s) of that antibiotic in the enzyme com-
plex, labeling with the semisynthetic 9-O-[p-(trifluoro-
ethyldiazirinyl)-benzoyl]-21,23-dideoxy-23-[125I]iodo-
concanolide A (J-concanolide A) was performed, which
still inhibits the V-ATPase 50% at a concentration of
15–20 ␮M. Upon treatment with UV light, a highly reac-
tive carbene is generated from this concanamycin deriv-
ative, resulting in the formation of a covalent bond to
the enzyme. In addition, the radioactive tracer 125I
makes the detection of the labeled subunit(s) feasible.
Treatment of the V1/Vo holoenzyme, the Vo complex, and
the V-ATPase containing goblet cell apical membranes
with concanolide resulted in the labeling of only the
proteolipid, subunit c, of the proton translocating Vo
complex. Binding of J-concanolide A to subunit c was
prevented in a concentration-dependent manner by con-
canamycin A, indicating that labeling was specific.
Binding was also prevented by the plecomacrolides
bafilomycin A1 and B1, respectively, but not by the ben-
zolactone enamide salicylihalamide, a member of a
novel class of V-ATPase inhibitors.

Vacuolar-type ATPases (V-ATPases)1 are complex, hetero-
multimeric proteins consisting of a peripheral, catalytic V1
complex and a membrane bound, ion translocating Vo complex.

V-ATPases in eukaryotes appear to be exclusive proton pumps
that energize intracellular membranes of all cells as well as
plasma membranes in a variety of animal cells (1). V-ATPases
play crucial roles for many cellular processes and may also be
involved in diseases such as osteoporosis and cancer (2).

More than a decade ago, bafilomycin A1, a plecomacrolide
antibiotic containing a 16-membered lactone ring, was reported
to be a specific inhibitor of V-ATPases with a Ki value of less
than 10 nM (3). A structure-activity study showed that the
concanamycins, 18-membered plecomacrolides, exhibit 10-fold
lower Ki values and thus are better and more specific inhibitors
of V-ATPases than the bafilomycins (4). Kinetic studies of the
bovine chromaffin granule V-ATPase provided the first indirect
evidence that bafilomycin A1 interacts with the hydrophobic Vo
complex (5). Direct evidence came from two independent ap-
proaches, both using the bovine-coated vesicle V-ATPase (6, 7).
First, a latent acid-activated proton conductance of proteolipo-
somes containing the reconstituted Vo complex could be blocked
by 1 nM bafilomycin A1 (6). Second, reconstituted vesicles con-
taining the Vo complex added to clathrin-coated vesicles could
protect ATP-dependent proton transport from bafilomycin in-
hibition (7). Since considerable protection was also achieved by
the reconstituted 100-kDa subunit a alone, it was concluded
that the binding site for bafilomycin may reside in this subunit.
Affinity chromatography of chicken osteoclast V-ATPase us-
ing bafilomycin C1-coupled cellulose led to the purification of
the holoenzyme (8). In the presence of 1 mM DCCD the
V-ATPase did not bind to the column, indicating that the bind-
ing site for bafilomycin is near the binding site(s) for DCCD and
may thus be located in the proteolipid, subunit c. However,
because DCCD, especially at the rather high concentration of 1
mM, may bind to sites different from that in the proteolipid and
may bind not only to carboxyl groups but also to sulfhydryl
groups or to tyrosine residues (9), and since the 100-kDa sub-
unit a was not clearly resolved in this study, the bafilomycin
binding subunit was still not identified. Strong hints in favor of
subunit c representing the bafilomycin binding subunit were
provided by recent results from analysis of Neurospora crassa
strains, indicating that those with point mutations in subunit c
show a higher tolerance to bafilomycin (I50 80–400 nM) com-
pared with the wild type (I50 6.3 nM); interestingly, the toler-
ance to concanamycin was not changed simultaneously (10).

Based on extensive screening studies of systematically mod-
ified derivatives of concanamycin, a probe was designed that
still inhibits V-ATPase activity and which generates upon
UV-irradiation a covalent bond between the inhibitor and the
V-ATPase (11, 12). In the present report we show for the first
time that this derivative of concanamycin A, 9-O-[p-(trifluoro-
ethyldiazirinyl)-benzoyl]-21,23-dideoxy-23-[125I]iodo-concanol-
