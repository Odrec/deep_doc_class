Abstract

This study concentrated on the study practices of advanced medical students, and on how
these are related to study success. All 67 participants were high achievers who had gone
through a demanding selection process. The subjects completed a questionnaire concentrating
on their study practices and conceptions of knowledge. Individual ways of interacting with
the learning environment were looked at in the light of interviews of 35 volunteer students.
The results showed that students’ individual study orchestrations were related to study success.
It was concluded that dissonant study orchestrations may develop because of the mismatch
between the demands of the learning environment and students’ personal goals.

1. Introduction

Research on student learning has shown the importance of study approaches for
study success (e.g., Marton & Sa¨ljo¨, 1976; Entwistle & Ramsden, 1983; Marton et
al., 1984). Recently, attention has been paid to students’ personal and individual
ways of dealing with their learning environment. In particular,
the differences

between failing and disabled students and more successful ones have been investi-
gated (e.g., Meyer et al., 1990b; Entwistle et al., 1991).

Our research, however, concerns high achieving students in medicine and psy-
chology. We have explored student learning in higher education by using various
methodologies, looking at spontaneous strategy use (Lonka et al., 1994; Lahtinen et
al., 1997; S ), epistemologies and conceptions of learning (Lonka & Lindblom-
Yla¨nne, 1995, 1996; Lonka et al., 1996), instructional interventions (Lonka & Ahola,
1995; Meyer & Lindblom-Yla¨nne, 1997), and university selection procedures
(Lindblom-Yla¨nne et al., 1996a, b). This extensive research program has shown that
conceptions and epistemologies may affect the quality of study activities which, in
turn, have an impact on learning outcomes, and that it is possible to design inter-
ventions aiming at changing these activities (Lonka, 1997).

1.1. Some theoretical constructs in student learning

Our studies listed above as well as those previously published by others suggest
that students’ conceptions of learning, approaches to learning and the levels of pro-
cessing may be roughly divided into two categories: surface-level reproduction (or
memorizing) versus deep-level transformation (or construction) of knowledge, the
latter being associated with qualitatively better learning (Sa¨ljo¨, 1979; Marton et al.,
1984; Ryan, 1984; Thomas & Bain, 1984; van Rossum & Schenk, 1984; Bereiter &
Scardamalia, 1987; Vermunt & van Rijswijk, 1988; Entwistle & Entwistle, 1992;
Lonka et al., 1994). Various terminologies are used when talking about surface-level
and deep-level conceptions or approaches. In the present paper, we will refer to
this general distinction by using the terms “surface approach” and “deep approach”
(Marton & Sa¨ljo¨, 1976; Entwistle & Ramsden, 1983; Biggs, 1993).

Another relevant dimension in student learning is regulation activities. They aim
at controlling student learning activities at the metacognitive level. Processing actions
may be controlled either internally or externally, and students may differ in terms
of their tendency to express self-regulation, to depend on external regulation, or to
lack regulatory skills altogether (Vermunt & van Rijswijk, 1988). The reported
degree of self-regulation has been shown to be related to efﬁcient studying in medi-
cine (Lonka et al., 1993) and in many other domains (Vermunt & van Rijswijk,
1988).

Self-regulation in learning is most often related to the deep approach, whereas
external regulation is more likely to be associated with surface approach (Vermunt &
van Rijswijk, 1988; Beishuizen et al., 1994; Lonka & Lindblom-Yla¨nne, 1996). Other
combinations, especially self-regulation with the surface approach, may result in poor
learning outcomes (Beishuizen et al., 1994).

Yet another important determinant of study practices in higher education is stu-
dents’ conceptions of knowledge, that is, their general epistemologies. Perry (1970)
described the epistemological development of a college student as moving from a
primitive dualist conception of knowledge towards a more relativistic conception. In
the beginning, knowledge is seen as an unorganized set of discrete and absolute
truths (dualist orientation), but this conception gradually changes and knowledge is
