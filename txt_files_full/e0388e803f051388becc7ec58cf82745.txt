Feed - Forward and Feed - Back control are not mutually exclusive! 

Which Statements are correct? 

5 

¨  Feed-Forward Control is an anticipatory process, and therefore rather fast. In contrast 

Feed-Back Control is reactive and can lead to oscilations, and is therefore slower. 

¨  In the motor system the lateral pathway is concerned with posture and balance. 

¨  After an upper motor lesion there is initially an increase in the muscle tone, that later 

decreases again. 

¨  Spinal shock is a phenomenon that follows spinal cord injury, and is characerized by 

paralysis and initial areflexia. 

 
¨  In an experiment where a frog's leg is fixated and the spinal cord is stimulated at different 

sites, the resulting Force-Field is characterized by a distinct Equilibrium Point for each 
leg position.

The Cerebellum 

8 

  The cerebellum: 

¡  Part of the rombencephalon 
¡  10% of total brain volume, but 50% 

of neurons 
  Functions: 

¡  Control of balance and posture 
¡  Coordination of voluntary 

movements 

¡  Motor learning 
¡  Also: cognitive function 

Position of the cerebellum in the motor system

  Receives input via mossy 
fibers and climbing fibers 
from: 
¡  Spino-cerebellar tract (limb position) 
¡  Brain stem nuclei (balance, spatial 

orientation) 

commands) 

movement) 

¡  Inferior olive (currently executed motor 

¡  Cerebrum via pons (planning of 

  Projects it's output through 

purkinje cells to: 
¡  Brain stem (motor execution) 
¡  Motor and premotor cortices via 

thalamus (movement tuning) 

¡  Vestibular nuclei (balance and eye 

movement) 

Cerebrum vs. Cerebellum 

10 

  Cerebrum: 
  20% inhibitory neurons 
  Excitatory input and output 
  Most areas (V1, V2, FFA, PPA,...) have 
excitatory connections with each other 

  Backbone of recurrent excitation
  
  The cerebrum is ‘mostly talking to itself ’ 

  Cerebellum: 
  Excitatory input, inhibitory output
  No recurrent activation 
  Request from outside, computation, output 
  No self-sustained activation over longer 

periods of  time (on demand computations) 

  

  Without external input there is no activity (in 

contrast to cerebral cortex) 

Cerebellar Lesions 

11 

  Decomposition of movements (i.e. 

sequential movements)  

  Intentional Tremor  
  Dysmetry (loss of precision of 

movements)  

  Nystagmus (jittering eye 

movements)  

  Deficits in motor learning  
  Dysdiadochokinesia (inability to 

perform rapidly alternating 
antagonistic movements)  

  Delayed movement initiation  

Layers of the Cerebellum

Classical Conditioning 

13 

The Role of the Cerebellum in Conditioning 

14 

  Before Conditioning:  

¡  Bell rings → excitatory input via 

mossy fibers 

¡  Granule cells encode the state of 

the system (e.g. eyes open)  
¡  Purkinje cells get excited via 
synapses with parallel fibers  

Ø Inhibition of the deep nuclei 
Ø No response to the bell ring  

The Role of the Cerebellum in Conditioning 

15 

  During Conditioning:  

¡  Bell rings 
¡  Air puff is sensed (error) 
¡  Strong exicatory input via climbing 

fibers as an error signal (internal 
model / connectivity has to be 
changed) 

¡  Simultaneous stimulation of purkinje 

cell through parallel fibers and 
climbing fibers 

Ø Weakening of the purkinje - 

parallel fibers synapses through 
Long-Term-Depression 

Ø Blink response 

The Role of the Cerebellum in Conditioning 

16 

  After Conditioning:  

¡  Bell rings 

Ø Eye gets closed according to the 

changed internal model (less 
inibition of the deep nuclei 
through to weakening of purkinje 
- parallel fibers synapses, but still 
activation of nuclei through 
mossy fibers) 

  The synapses of the parallel fibers 
targeting the Purkinje cells are 
modified (LTD of  synapses when 
the climbing fibers are active). I.e. 
an error signal leads to the change 
of an internal model. 

Timing is everything 

17 
  One Purkinje cell connects to a large 
number of parallel fibres. 
  At each point in time: 
¡  Each individual parallel fibre has a 
specific activation level. 
¡  The pattern of active parallel fibres 

projecting onto one Purkinje cells is very 
specific. 

  When LTD occurs, the synapses 
between affected Purkinje cell and 
active parallel fibres are weakened. 
  The next time this exact pattern 
comes around, it will be less 
effective! 

How does LTD work?

Ø 

Climbing fiber activation strongly depolarizes the Purkinje cell dendrite, which leads to the activation of 
voltage-gated calcium channels 
Parallel fiber activation leads to Na+ entry through AMPA receptors 
Generation of diacyglycerol (DAG) via stimulation of the metabotropic receptor. DAG activates protein 
kinase C (PKC) 
What happens next is still under investigation but it involves the phosphorylation of proteins, including an 
AMPA receptor subunit, by PKC.  

      Decrease of AMPA receptor channels
