Introduction 

Since the early 1990s the concept of emergence 
received an increasing interest in both cognitive 
science and the philosophy of mind.  
Associated with this concept is the hope 
•  to adequately classify hard philosophical 

problems such as the problem of phenomenal 
qualities, and  

•  to characterize adequately behaviors of artificial 
systems, which are not explicitly programmed, 
but rise from self-organizing processes.
