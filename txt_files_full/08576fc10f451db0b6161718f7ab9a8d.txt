Exercise 1

A: presupposition For sentence (i) to be true, Steven has to know some-
thing that is correct. Therefore, we need to presuppose sentence (ii). Correct
sentences including knowing always presuppose truth.

B: none This statement could not be seen as an implicature, due to the
fact that even if the information that IBM builds telephones were true, what
Maude believes (not knows!) is never objective.

C: presupposition The term proved implies logical derivability, there-
fore (ii) is to be presupposed for (i) to make sense.

D: implicature did not tell many would also include did not tell any
which would contradict (ii). Still our understanding of not many yields some.

E: presupposition Again, (ii) is necessary for (i) to make sense. If there
were no re inspector in our town, it would be impossible to talk to him.

F: implicature The logical interpretation of some yields at least one.
Therefore all would also be a correct interpretation, still if we want to
express all, we would use it as term. Therefore, our understanding gives us
the correct solution.

Excercise 2

1) Usually on Fridays I sing in the choir [implicature: also next Friday] but
this Friday I won't [implicature defeated].

2) There are ten people in our PoM seminar [implicature: there are no
more than ten people in our seminar], in fact there are even eleven people
including the prof [implicature defeated].

3) She won't necessarily get the job [impliciture: she won't get it] but she
possibly gets it [implicature defeated].

Excercise 3

Fred brought two bottles of wine

a) From what is said... For the sentence to be correct, Fred must have
brought not less than two bottles. If he had less, it would not be true any-
more. Logically, two just limits the minimum of bottles, Fred must have
brought. If he had brought more than two, the statement would be still true.

b) Gricean Maximes Due to the Maxim of quality, we know that Fred
did not bring less than two bottles of wine; otherwise the sentence would be
wrong. For the sentence being true, according to the Maxim of quantity, it
would have to be most informative, too. Therefore, the speaker must have
told the maximum number of bottles that Fred brought. Hence we know
Fred did not bring more than 2 bottles. Combining those, 2 bottles is the
only number of bottles yielding the truth value 1.

c) Conversional context The gist of the sentence is clearly informative:
person A informs person B about something person C (Fred) did. To do so,
over- or underestimating the real number of bottles would not make sense
at all. Thus we assume A told the exact number.

Derivation of the sentences is accomlished via beta-reduction. Note that,
while usually you plug the right node into the left head, in the case of the
VP branch, the left VP is the input for the right PP.

Derivation of i) The German President met the King of France yesterday.

1. Something happened yesterday:

λt ∈ D<<e,t>,<e,t>>.[λf ∈ D<e,t>.f happened at time t] (yesterday)

2. What happened? Somebody was met:

f = λx ∈ D<<e,t>,t>.[λg ∈ D<<<e,t>,t>,<e,t>>.x was met] (the KoF)

3. This somebody was a specic person, a king of France:

g = λx0 ∈ D<e,t>.[λk ∈ D<e,t>.k is a king of France] (the KoF from
yesterday)

Derivation of ii) analagous to that of i), just replace German President
for King of France

b)

The truth values would yield false in both cases.

c) Explanation

Regarding the rst sentence, this is due to the fact, that the king of France
is no valid entity. According to Russell, the sentence would yield false, due
to the existence failure of the entity. Because there is no king of France
nowadays, the sentence is simply wrong.

In Strawson's theory, the sentence would be neither true nor false. Be-
cause the entity does not exist, the sentence expresses nothing and thus
cannot be true or false.

According to Heim and Kratzer, the sentences are uninterpretable.

d) Our intuitions

(i)
In the rst case, the agent exists; the not existing entity is just the input
argument of the transitive verb. Therefore the sentence is simply false: The
German president, who exists, cannot meet the French king (not in past;
especially nowadays).

(ii)
In the second case, the agent of the sentence does not exist. Because of
that, the whole sentence neither seems true nor false. We cannot determine
whether anything that is not part of our world can meet somebody else.
Intuitively, the sentence seems just uninterpretable.
