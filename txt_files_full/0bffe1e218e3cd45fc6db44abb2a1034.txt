Research questions 

• What factors determine or influence the occurrence of trees in 

high elevation areas of the European Alps? 

• How is the tree line ecotone projected to respond to climatic 

changes such as increasing atmospheric CO2 and higher 
mean temperature?

The effect of local topography 

• Slope curvature: 

trees advance higher 
on ridges (more snow 
and avalanches in 
ravines) 

• Slope exposition: 

trees advance higher on south-facing slopes 
(only with the presence of much snow)

The tree line under climate change 

• Global warming affects the tree line: 

– Increasing air and soil temperature 

– Warmer winters 

– Extension of growing season

The tree line under climate change 

• Global warming affects the tree line: 

– Increasing air and soil temperature 

– Warmer winters 

– Extension of growing season 

• Responses: 

– Higher C uptake due to higher net primary 

production (despite a higher respiration) 

– Potential upward shift of tree lines

Increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration 

 

How relevant is this for the future of tree lines?

Conclusions 

• The position of the tree line is primarily controlled by the 

temperature. 

• On a larger scale, many (local) environmental factors are 
important for the shape and the characteristics of the tree 
line. 

 

•

Investigations at the tree line indicate a contribution of 
climate change to an upslope advance of tree lines. 

• The presumed upward advance of tree lines as a 

consequence of climate change is rather a result of 
warming than of elevated CO2.
