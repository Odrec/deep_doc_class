“Refugees	Welcome?	Migration,	Citizenship	and	the	Question	of	Rights”	

In	this	lecture,	Leti	Volpp	will	consider	the	relationship	between	migration,	citizenship	
and	rights	by	focusing	upon	a	particular	sign,	its	transatlantic	circulation,	and	
contestation	as	to	its	meaning.	The	sign	…	was		created		in		1990		as		a	trafAic	sign	by	the	
California	Department	of	Transportation	in	order	to	deter	drivers	from		hitting		
pedestrians		crossing		freeways		near		border		checkpoints		in		Southern	California.		In	
the	United	States,	the	sign	is	correlated	with	illegal	immigration.		The	symbol			of			
immigrants			running			re-emerged			under			the			banner			of			“Refugees	Welcome”	in	
Europe,	as	seen	in	football	stadiums	and	train	stations	across	Germany	in		late		August,		
2015.	Tracing	this	image’s	circulation	an	its	transformations	demonstrates	how	
dramatic	events	in	recent	months	have	shaped		
immigration	and	refugee	policies	in	both	the			
United	States	and	Germany.	This	investigation			
also	sheds	light	on	the	triangulated		relationship		
	between		the		illegal		immigrant		and		the	refugee,		
a	relationship	shaped	by	racialization,	territoriality,		
and	a	dissimilar	access	to	rights,	whether	as	hu-	
mans,	or	noncitizens.

Hybridity	in	Middlesex	

Middlesex,	“like	its	hermaphroditic		
narrator,	was	meant	to	be	a	hybrid.”	
	Generic	hybridity	following	thematic	hybridity:	
	“When	Eugenides	weaves	his	story	of	the	hermaphrodite	
Cal(lie)	into	an	account	of	Greek	immigration	and	
assimilation	to	mid-twentieth-century	American	culture,	he	
implicitly	overdetermines	the	metaphor	of	hybridity	to	
refer	at	once	to	the	body,	to	cultural	identity,	and	to	
narrative	structure.”	(Shostak	384)

	“[L]ogical	connection	between	the	discourses	of	
ethnic	and	gendered	identities.”	(386)	
	“How	does	the	ambiguity	inherent	to	geographical	
dislocation	deAine	the	subject’s	position	within	a	
national	culture?	How,	likewise,	does	the	ambiguity	
of	a	bodily	formation	relative	to	normative	
conAigurations	deAine	the	subject’s	categorical	
position	within	the	“human”?	(386)

Hybridity	in	Middlesex	

	How	do	characters	deal	with	their	“dislocation”	and	how	
are	dislocative	processes	and	notions	of	in-between-ness	
complicit	in	the	conAiguration	of	their	identities	(e.g.	Lefty,	
Desdemona,	Milton,	Callie)?	
	How	does	Cal(lie)	deal	with	her/his	bodily	dislocation,	how	
does	she/he	rhetorically	reAlect	upon	her/his	in-between-
ness	in	terms	of	sex	and	gender?	
	How	are	the	two	analogous?

Hybridity	in	Middlesex	

	“Middlesex	offers	a	critique	of	the	limitations	Cal	himself	seems	not	to	
recognize	fully,	because	he	lives	in	the	midst	of	them.	This	disjunction	
perhaps	explains	why,	ever	the	humanist,	he	continues	to	protest	that	
one	can	choose	and	that	one’s	choice	can	counter	genes	or	upbringing	
–	that	the	“girl”	Callie	can	metamorphose	into	the	“man”	Cal,	or	that	
the	Greek	Lefty	and	Desdemona	can	become	happily	American.	But	
the	unrepresentability	of	such	a	choice	does	not	support	a	position	of	
betweenness.”	(Shostak	411)	
	The	“narrative	is	complicit	in	a	heteronormative	temporality	which	
reinforces	the	causal	relationship	between	sex,	gender	and	sexuality	
which	queer	theorists	have	sought	to	interrogate.”	(Carroll	187)
