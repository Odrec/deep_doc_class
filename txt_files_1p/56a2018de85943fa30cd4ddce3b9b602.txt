Insights and Blindspots of the
Cognitivist Theory of Emotions

Andrea Scarantino

ABSTRACT

Philosophical cognitivists have argued for more than four decades that emotions are
special types of judgments. Anti-cognitivists have provided a series of counterexamples
aiming to show that identifying emotions with judgments overintellectualizes the emo-
tions. I provide a novel counterexample that makes the overintellectualization charge
especially vivid. I discuss neurophysiological evidence to the effect that the fear system
can be activated by stimuli the subject is unaware of seeing. To emphasize the analogy
with blindsight, I call this phenomenon blindfright. Cognitivists may reply that blind-
fright is nothing but an unconscious judgment subcortically elicited. This reply is in line
with the strategy commonly employed by cognitivists against their critics. I call it the
Elastic Strategy, because it consists of ‘stretching’ the notion of judgment in order to
accommodate counterexamples. This strategy, I argue, turns cognitivism into a theory
that is at worst unfalsiﬁable and at best trivially true. The ﬁnal portion of my article aims
to rescue cognitivism from the damage done by the Elastic Strategy. I distinguish three
varieties of cognitivism, one concerned with what emotions essentially are (Constitutive
Cognitivism), one concerned with what causes emotions (Etiological Cognitivism) and
one concerned with what emotions represent (Representational Cognitivism). I conclude
that what cognitivism has to offer to emotion theory are primarily insights concerning the
causes and representational content of emotions. The constitutive identiﬁcation of emo-
tions with judgments, on the other hand, does more harm than good.
