“First Past the Post” System

Every member of Congress is elected using the “first 
past post” system.

Senators represent the entire state.
Within each state are “House Districts” where an election 
is held to determine who will represent that district in the 
House of Representatives.

Similar to a Wahlkreis
The person with the most votes in a given district is sent to 
the House of Representatives.

There is no proportional representation in the U.S. 
federal system.

(2013 Bundestag Election)

Under the German 
System:
CDU/CSU 41,5%
SPD 25,7%
Linke 8,6%
Grüne 8.4%
With 5% hurdle
Seats are distributed 
according to proportion 
of vote.

Powers herein granted

“All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested 
in a Congress of the United States . . . “

Article I, Section 1 of the United States Constitution

This limiting language means that Congress may only 
pass laws related to the specific powers it is granted in 
the Constitution.

Article I, Section 8 sets out those powers.

U.S. Constitutional Law

Taxing Power

Under Articles of Confederation, Congress had no 
taxing power.
Article 1: Congress has the power to tax in order to 
“provide for the common defense and general welfare.”

The 16th Amendment expressly allows the federal 
government to collect an income tax.

May taxes be used to regulate conduct?

READ National Federation of Independent Business v 
Sebelius (2012) (see link on StudIP)
Does the Supreme Court allow Congress to uses its tax 
power to regulate how individuals behave in the health care 
market?

U.S. Constitutional Law

Legislative Powers

Spending Power

The “provide” language in Article 1, Section 8, Clause 
1 is source of spending power. 

The U.S. Supreme Court has created a four part test to 
determine whether spending power is being used 
properly:

(1) the spending power must be exercised in pursuit of the 
general welfare, 
(2) grant conditions must be clearly stated, 
(3) the conditions must be related to a federal interest in the 
national program or project, and 
(4) the spending power cannot be used to induce states to 
do things that would themselves be unconstitutional.

South Dakota v. Dole (1987)

Congress passes law telling states that they will lose 
10% of their federal highway funds if they do not raise 
their minimum drinking age to 21.

Federal interest in giving states money for roads is to 
create a safe system of roads.
Raising drinking age to 21 will advance this interest by 
making the roads even safer.
Losing 10% of funds for failure to comply is seen as an 
“inducement,” not compulsion.

National Federation of Independent 

Business v Sebelius (2012)

States who do not agree to provide more people with 
Medicaid health insurance will lose all federal 
Medicaid funding.
“Congress may use its spending power to create 
incentives for States to act in accordance with federal 
policies. But when "pressure turns into compulsion," 
the legislation runs contrary to our system of 
federalism.” - majority opinion

In Dole, the loss of funds amounted to 5% of states' total 
road budget, here the loss of funds amounts to between 
50% and 80% of states' Medicaid budget.

This is compulsion rules the Court.

Placement of the Clause

Art I, Sec 8

Art I, Sec 9

Sets forth powers that 
Congress has.
Marshall says the 
Necessary and Proper 
Clause is placed here to 
expand powers.

Contains a list of things 
Congress cannot due.
Places limits on 
Congress.
Marshall says if intent 
was limited power, then  
Necessary & Proper 
Clause would have been 
placed here.

Constitutionality of the Law

Congress may choose any means, not prohibited by 
the Constitution, to carry out its express authority.

Necessary means useful or desirable, not indispensable 
or essential.
the “provision is made in a constitution, intended to 
endure for ages to come, and consequently, to be 
adapted to the various crises of human affairs.”
This does not equate to limitless authority.

Must further enumerated power
Must not violate the Constitution.

Later Cases

U.S. vs Gettysburg Elec. Ry. Co. (1896) considered 
whether Congress had the power to condemn a 
railroad's land in what was to be Gettysburg National 
Military Park.

Does the Congress have the express power to condemn 
land?
The Court eventually says that the land condemnation 
was necessary to further express power. Which ones?

We will address these questions in class. See link to 
website on StudIP to read the case.
