Retrospective Sex : Rewriting
Intersexuality in Jeﬀrey
Eugenides’s Middlesex

R A C H E L C A R R O L L

This article examines the representation of intersexuality in Jeﬀrey Eugenides’s Pulitzer Prize-
winning 2002 novel Middlesex. It situates the depiction of intersexuality within the context of
current scholarship on sexed identity within the ﬁeld of gender and sexuality studies. It argues
that while a ﬁctional focus on ambiguously sexed identity might appear to be aligned with
queer critiques of ﬁxed categories of ‘‘ sex, ’’ Eugenides’s narrative remains implicated in
heteronormative assumptions. More speciﬁcally, it will explore the narrative strategies which
frame Calliope Stephanides’s intersexed body, focussing on the relationship between the
male-identiﬁed adult Cal,
‘‘ author ’’ of this ﬁctional autobiography, and his remembered
teenage girl self. It will suggest that the retrospective logic at work in this narrative is complicit
in a heteronormative temporality which reinforces the causal relationship between sex, gender
and sexuality which queer theorists have sought to interrogate.

The narrative of Jeﬀery Eugenides’s 2002 comic epic of Greek American
identity, Middlesex, journeys through time and space from Greco-Turkish
hostilities in Smyrna in 1912, to the 1967 ‘‘ race riots ’’ in Detroit, through to
post-uniﬁcation Berlin in 2001. However, this reconstructed family history is
also mapped against the narrator’s retrospective account of an ambiguously
sexed identity. Intersexuality demonstrates both the indeterminacy of ‘‘ sex ’’
as a category by which to deﬁne bodies and identities and the normative
violence to which deviant bodies are subject.1 Indeed, the medical and
surgical management of intersexed bodies can be considered symptomatic
of a heteronormative imperative ; as Alice Domurat Dreger has put it,
