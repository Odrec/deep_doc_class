Abstract

This study concentrated on the study practices of advanced medical students, and on how
these are related to study success. All 67 participants were high achievers who had gone
through a demanding selection process. The subjects completed a questionnaire concentrating
on their study practices and conceptions of knowledge. Individual ways of interacting with
the learning environment were looked at in the light of interviews of 35 volunteer students.
The results showed that students’ individual study orchestrations were related to study success.
It was concluded that dissonant study orchestrations may develop because of the mismatch
between the demands of the learning environment and students’ personal goals.
