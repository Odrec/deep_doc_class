To  determine   whether   child   maltreatment   has   a  long-term   impact   on  emotion   processing
abilities   in   adulthood   and   whether   IQ,   psychopathology,   or   psychopathy   mediate   the   rela-
tionship  between   childhood   maltreatment   and   emotion   processing   in   adulthood.   Using
a  prospective   cohort   design,   children   (ages   0–11)   with   documented   cases   of   abuse   and
neglect   during   1967–1971   were   matched   with   non-maltreated   children   and   followed   up
into  adulthood.   Potential   mediators   (IQ,   Post-Traumatic   Stress   [PTSD],   Generalized   Anx-
iety  [GAD],   Dysthymia,   and   Major   Depressive   [MDD]   Disorders,   and   psychopathy)   were
assessed   in   young   adulthood   with   standardized   assessment   techniques.   In   middle   adult-
hood  (Mage =  47),   the   International   Affective   Picture   System   was   used   to  measure   emotion
processing.   Structural   equation   modeling   was  used   to  test   mediation   models.   Individuals
with   a  history   of  childhood   maltreatment   were   less   accurate   in   emotion   processing   overall
and  in   processing   positive   and   neutral   pictures   than   matched   controls.   Childhood   physical
abuse  predicted   less   accuracy   in   neutral   pictures   and   childhood   sexual   abuse   and   neglect
predicted   less   accuracy   in   recognizing   positive   pictures.   MDD,   GAD,   and   IQ  predicted   over-
all   picture   recognition   accuracy.   However,   of   the   mediators   examined,   only   IQ   acted   to
mediate  the  relationship   between   child   maltreatment   and   emotion   processing   deﬁcits.
Although   research   has   focused   on   emotion   processing   in   maltreated   children,   these   new
ﬁndings   show   an   impact   child   abuse   and   neglect   on  emotion   processing   in   middle   adult-
hood.   Research   and  interventions   aimed   at   improving   emotional   processing   deﬁciencies   in
abused  and   neglected   children   should   consider   the   role   of   IQ.

A  key  component  of  social  competence  is  emotion  processing,  which  includes  emotion  perception,  communication,  inter-
pretation,  and  regulation  of  emotion  (Halberstadt,  Denham,  &  Dunsmore,  2001).  Emotions  function  to  provide  information
about  the  environment  and  prepare  for  a  behavioral  response,  triggering  the  appetitive  or  defensive  systems,  depending  on
the  situation  (Bradley,  Codispoti,  Cuthbert,  &  Lang,  2001).  Theories  of  emotion  suggest  that  behavioral  responses  to  emotions
are  directly  related  to  emotion  processing  (Halberstadt  et  al.,  2001).  This  paper  brings  together  research  on  child  maltreat-
ment,  emotional  development,  and  psychopathology  to  examine  the  consequences  of  child  abuse  and  neglect  for  emotion
processing  in  adulthood.
