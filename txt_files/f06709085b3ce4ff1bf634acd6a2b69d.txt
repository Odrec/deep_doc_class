Characteristics of the 
Adversarial System

● Parties dictate the form, content and speed of 

the process.

● Pre-Trial process allows parties to “discover” 

information (“facts”).

● At trail, the judge takes a “back seat” to the 

advocates.
➢ it is the job of the advocates to present evidence to 

the fact finder (judge or jury)

● Throughout the process witnesses and evidence 

are “examined” by the advocates.

 

Criminal v. Civil

● Names of the Parties
● Number of People Involved
● Penalty/Remedy
● Burden of Proof

● NOTE – there are vast differences between the 

two when it comes to procedure.
