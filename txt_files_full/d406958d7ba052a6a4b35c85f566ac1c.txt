Day two:  The Curse of 

Knowledge 

And some poetics of surprise 

The lecture-ish bit 

Introducing 

•  The rug-pull and… 
•  The idea of the “well-made” surprise 
•  Term borrowed from theatre

Surprise, surprise 

Say... 

Sense in retrospect 

Set them up and 
knock them down 

Engineering this kind of surprise is a 
common enough thing to want to do. 
 
But it’s also really quite 
difficult.  
 

One simple trick 

Some examples 

Embedded 
perspectives 

“Searched every where” 

Poe’s “Purloined 
Letter” 

“The Adventure of the Dying Detective” 

Arthur Conan 
Doyle 

“Facts are facts” 

Arthur Conan 
Doyle 

“Facts are facts” 

Arthur Conan 
Doyle 

Or The Usual Suspects (1995) 

So 

Why? (How?) 

A pervasive bias in keeping track of who 
knows what, and what that means. 
 
Trouble keeping your ideas  
to yourself. 
 
And, more generally, a mental contamination 
effect – hard to set aside knowledge once 
you have it. 

“I am not left handed!” 

Buyers and sellers 
 

 
The usual assumption: 
knowing more gives you the 
upper hand 
 

The Curse of Knowledge 
 
Camerer, Loewenstein & Weber 1989; Birch 
& Bloom 2003, 2004; Birch 2005 
 
 

Once we know something, it’s very 
difficult for us to simulate not knowing 
it. 
 
 

Loads of related effects 

The ‘tapping study’ (Newton 1994) 
‘Sally-Ann for grown-ups’ (Birch and Bloom 2004) 
The ‘illusory transparency of intention’ (Keysar 1994, 
2000) 
The judged obviousness of solutions (Kelley & Jacoby 
1996) 
The ‘transparency’ of idioms (Keysar and Bly 1995) 

Hazards 

•  Explaining complex ideas to laypeople 
•  Creating clear instructions 
•  Experiment design 
•  Not looking beyond an “obvious” known 
solution to identify other approaches

Errors

(etc.) 

Constructive 

Cues 

Keeping perspectives 
distinct 
 
“As Robert Frost said, ‘Good fences 
make good neighbors.’” 
 
 

So... 

Unreliability 

Retrospect 

(Not) appreciating more  
naive perspectives:  
including your own  

Traitorous 
readings? 

Unreliable narration

The Murder of 
Roger Ackroyd 

The Murder of Roger Ackroyd 

“The trick played on the reader in The Murder of 
Roger Ackroyd is hardly a legitimate device of the 
detective-story writer” 
“Crude” methods 
“Cheating on the person of the narration” 

The Murder of Roger Ackroyd 

Merely “a natural resentment at having been 
ingeniously bamboozled”? 

 

The Murder of Roger Ackroyd 

I am rather pleased with myself as a writer.  What could be neater, 
for instance, than the following: 
“The letters were brought in at twenty minutes to nine. It was 
just on ten minutes to nine when I left him, the letter still unread. I 
hesitated with my hand on the door handle, looking back and 
wondering if there was anything I had left undone.” 
All true, you see. But suppose I had put a row of stars after the 
first sentence! Would somebody then have wondered what exactly 
happened in that blank ten minutes?  

Roger Ebert 

The story builds up to a blinding revelation, which shifts 
the nature of all that has gone before, and the surprise 
filled me not with delight but with the feeling that the 
writer, Christopher McQuarrie, and the director, Bryan 
Singer, would have been better off unraveling their 
carefully knit sleeve of fiction and just telling us a story 
about their characters - those that are real, in any event. 
I prefer to be amazed by motivation, not manipulation. 

Retrospect 

Misdirection 

A different sort of 
communion and a 
different sort of alliance 

Unsettling 

Distance 

So… 

Elementary! 

…like all Holmes's reasoning the thing 
seemed simplicity itself when it was 
once explained. He read the thought 
upon my features, and his smile had a 
tinge of bitterness. 
 
"I am afraid that I rather give myself 
away when I explain," said he.
