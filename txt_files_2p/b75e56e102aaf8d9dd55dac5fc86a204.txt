The FMSO-KU Global Security Studies Internship is a cooperative 
project of FMSO and the KU CGIS. This internship has been designed to 
provide an opportunity for graduate students to learn more about global 
security  and  military  operational  environment  analysis  and  discover 
how open source foreign language materials are used in developing 
solid research products. This analysis does not necessarily reflect the 
views of the FMSO.

Open Source, Foreign Perspective, Underconsidered/Understudied Topics

The Foreign Military Studies Office (FMSO) at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, is an open 
source research organization of the U.S. Army.  It was founded in 1986 as an innovative 
program that brought together military specialists and civilian academics to focus on military 
and security topics derived from unclassified, foreign media. Today FMSO maintains this 
research tradition of special insight and highly collaborative work by conducting unclassified 
research on foreign perspectives of defense and security issues that are understudied or 
unconsidered. 
The Center for Global and International Studies (CGIS), at the University of Kansas, 
exists as a catalyst for global and international studies in the College of Liberal Arts 
and Sciences. Building upon longstanding institutional strength in area studies and a 
commitment to international engagement, the Center: (1) provides a single point of contact 
and organization for College faculty with expertise in global and international studies; (2) 
promotes interdisciplinary research and teaching on topics and themes of transnational 
scope; (3) fosters research and expertise in world areas of growing economic and strategic 
importance not covered by the existing area studies centers; (4) stimulates grant activity 
and seeks external funding for curricular, research, and outreach projects in global and 
international studies; (5) provides a central home for interdisciplinary degree programs 
in international studies; (6) prepares students for careers in a global economy and an 
increasingly interconnected world; (7) promotes the global competitiveness of the state, 
the region, and the nation by providing outreach and support to businesses, schools, and 
government agencies.
Author Background
Molly Martin, a recent Trilingual MBA graduate at the University of Kansas, participated 
as a fellow in the FMSO-Kansas University (KU) Global Security Internship program from 
January through May 2012. Combining her extensive background in Latin American Studies 
with her economic and business education, Ms. Martin focused her research for this program 
on the impact of both poverty and wealth on Brazil’s security – particularly as the country is 
set to host two international sporting events in 2014 and 2016.
