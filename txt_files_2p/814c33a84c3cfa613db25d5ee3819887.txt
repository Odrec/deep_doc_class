Summary Howitt & Cramer, pp.:3-23 
- Essential concepts in research: cause, data, randomized experiment, reference, variable 
- read original research papers to see how research in a certain field is done 
- be careful about “scientific“ statements in the media, rather check what researcher actually meant 
- hypothesis: precise proposition serving as basis of further investigation 
- evaluating research papers includes examining if the provided data allows for a statement about 

the assertion and to what extend  

- causal relationships: can get confused with a simple relationship; to be a causal relationship one 

thing must cause the other 

- psychological research often focuses on the cause of things 

- without knowing the temporal sequence it is difficult to judge cause and effect 
- if two variables are measured at the same time it is hard to say which influences which 

one 

- a third factor might influence the causal relation or might be the actual cause 

- The important role of causal relations in psychology: 

- influence of logical positivism on psychology: description of methods of natural science, 

knowledge is gained by observation 

- psychology defines itself as biological as well as social science resulting in the adaption 

of research methods of natural sciences 

- randomized laboratory experiments provide the most convincing evidence of causality 
- weaker focus on causality in modern psychology  

- correlational and cross-sectional studies: 

- measurements taken at the same time 
- correlation coefficient measures relation between two variables 
- testing for differences between two variables (e.g. t-test) 

- confounding variables: variables influencing relation between two other variables 
- longitudinal studies: measure the same things at two different points in time, provides more 

information than cross-sectional studies 

- randomized studies: random assignment of subjects into trial groups or conditions; vulnerable to 

sampling error 

-  manipulating a variable can result in manipulating other variables as well without noticing it
