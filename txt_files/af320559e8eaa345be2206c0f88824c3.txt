Holocene climate changes and warm man-made refugia may explain
why a sixth of British butterflies possess unnatural early-successional
habitats

Analyses of their habitats indicate that  18% of British  butterfly
species  are  restricted  to  the earliest  serai  stages of  ecosystems,
whereas  the  same  species  occupy  later  serai  stages  in  central
Europe,  where  spring  and  summer  temperatures  are  warmer.
The  microclimates  of  their  British  habitats  are  exceptionally
warm, compensating  for the cooler climate.  Most of these Brit-
ish habitats are also ephemeral, and have long depended on man
for  their  creation  and  regeneration  This  poses  the  question  of
where  these  species  lived  before  man  created  their  habitats,
roughly  6000  BP,  I  suggest  that  they  are  relics  from  a  period
when  British  summers  were  warmer  than  today,  and that they
avoided  extinction  when  the  climate  cooled  hy  moving  into
warm  refugia  created  hy  prehistoric  man  within  three  types of
ecosystem  If summer temperatures become warmer, these spe-
cies should  return  to  later  serai  stages that  are commoner  and
less dependent  on man.

Introduction
Most  of  the  55 non-migratory  species of  butterfly  that
breed  in  Britain  have  abrupt  northern  limits  to  their
ranges  which  correlate  closely  with  summer  isotherms
(Dennis  1977, Heath  et  al  1984, Dennis  and  Wilhams
1986, Turner  et  al  1987)  Within  these  ranges, c  80%
ot  species  live  in  predominantly  closed  populations,
each  restricted  m its  local  distribution  by the  distribu-
tion of Its larval foodplant(s)  (Thomas  1984)  However,
few  species  occupy  more  than  a  small  fraction  of  the
sites  that  fulfil  these  basic  requirements  (Heath  et  al
1984, Thomas  1984)  Research  on  43% of  Bntish  but-
terfly  species has shown that, with three exceptions, this
IS because temales are selective during oviposition, and
restrict  egglaying  to foodplants  of  a particular  growth-
form  or micro-habitat,  species are confined  to localities
where plants of the required growth-forms exist m suffi-
cient  abundance,  and  continuity,  for  a  population  to
survive  (Thomas  1991)

The  narrowest  and  most  ephemeral  niches  recorded
among  Bntish  butterflies  belong  to  the  10  (18%  of)
species that  breed near the ground  in the earliest  stages
of  seres  (Thomas  1991)  Grassland  examples  include
Macuhnea anon  L  (which is an obligate parasite of the
ant  Myrmtca sabulett Meinert)  (Thomas  1991), Lxsan-
dra bellargus Rott  (Thomas  1983), Hesperta comma L
(Thomas  et  al  1986), Melitaea  ctnxta L  (Thomas  and
Simcox  1982, Thomas  1991) and  Htpparchta semele  L
(Heath  et  al  1984)  Boloria euphrosyne L ,  B  selene
Denis  & Schiff  , Argynnts adippe Denis  & Schiff  and
Mellicta athalta Rott  also  breed  in  the  earliest  serai
stages of  British  grassland,  but  most  populations  occur
in  recent  woodland  clearings  (Warren  1987a,  Warren
and Thomas  1992)  At the northern limit of its range, on
Welsh  heathland,  Plebejus  argus  L 
is  restncted  to
patches where the vegetation  has been burnt or cleared
in the previous five  years (Thomas, C  D  1983, 1985)
The ephemeral  British habitats of seven of these spe-
cies  depend  entirely  on  man  for  their  regeneration,
whereas  a  minority  of  populations  of  P  argus and H
semele also breed in "natural" pnmary habitats, such as
dunes and undercliffs,  Melitaea ctnxta is wholly depend-
ent on the  latter  in Britain  (Heath  et  al  1984, Thomas
1991)  This  IS no  recent  phenomenon  since  reeords
began,  most  or  all  populations  of  these  species  (apart
from  M  cinxta) bred  on  land  that  was being  managed
by the traditional  methods that  have prevailed  on  Brit-
ish heaths, grasslands and woods from  roughly 6000 BP
until  the  present  century  (Harris  1766,  Barrett  1893,
Heath  et al  1984, Thomas  1984,  1991, Rackham  1986,
Warren  and  Key  1991)  indeed,  it  is because  modern
forms of management have reduced both the abundance
and continuity of early serai stages within all three eco-
systems,  that  there  have  been  exceptionally  severe  re-
cent  declines  of  the  nine  species  that  inhabit  them
(Heath  et  al  1984)  populations  typically  survive  2-10

yr after  traditional management is abandoned  (Thomas
1984, 1991)

This raises the question  as to where these  butterflies
lived  between  c  95CX) BP,  when  modern  insects  rein-
vaded  Britain  after  the  last  ice  age  (Osborne  1976,
Dennis  1977,  1992)  and  c  6000  BP,  when  man  first
created their early serai habitats (Rackham 1986)  It is a
question  relevant  to other  taxa in Britain, and  perhaps
elsewhere in northern Europe  The suggestion that Brit-
ish butterfly  populations are more recent colonists from
southern  Europe  is untenable, due to their  distribution
pattern on the remoter islands, and to the subspeciation
and other adaptations  that  have evolved  (Dennis 1977,
1992)  Moreover  all seven  species in  this group whose
dispersal  has  been  studied  were  found  to be  unusually
sedentary  (Thomas  and  Simcox  1982,  Thomas  1983,
1991, Thomas,  C  D  1983, 1985, Thomas  et  al  1986,
Warren  1987b,  Thomas  and  Snazell  1989,  1985, Tho-
mas, C  D  etal  1992),itisextremely unlikely that they
could  have  crossed  the  English  Channel  after  the  land
hnk was broken, roughly 1000 yr before man altered the
British  landscape  The  sedentariness  and  population
structure  of  these  butterflies  also  make  it  improbable
that  even  the  four  species  that  inhabit  modern  wood-
land could have utilised their narrow niches when these
occasionally  existed,  for  periods  of  1 to  10 yr,  in small
isolated  patches  in the  ancient  wildwood  following  the
death  of  a  large  tree  (Warren  1987  a,b,  Thomas  and
Snazell  1989)

I drew attention to this conundrum  in a review of the
conservation  of  European  butterflies  (Thomas  1991),
and  speculated  that  these  species  might  once  have  in-
habited broader or different  niches to those of today  In
this paper I bring together  the published  evidence sup-
porting this idea, and present  new data on  lntraspecific
variation  in  niche  breadth,  and  on  the  warm  microcli-
mates inhabited by the young stages of some butterflies
I  also  extend  my  hypothesis,  by  suggesting  how  these
species may have survived m Britain when summer tem-
peratures  became  cooler,  after  the  land  link  with  the
continent  was broken

Methods and  sources
Niche  breadth  of butterflies  and ants at  different
latitudes
Precise  definitions  of  the  current  British  habitats  of
seven  species  were  obtained  from  publications,  theses
or  conservation  reports  Hesperia comma  (Thomas  et
al  1986),  Melitaea cinxia (Thomas  and  Simcox  1982,
Thomas  1991), Boloria euphrosyne, B  selene, and y4r-
gynnis adtppe (Thomas et al  in press), Mellicta athalta
(Warren  1987a),  Plebejus argus in  north  Wales  (Tho-
mas, C  D  1983) and south  England  (Read  1986)

In  addition,  the  distribution  of  2nd  generation  Ly-

sandra bellargus eggs was recorded in swards of varying

height on Old Winchester Hill, Hampshire, S  England
Annual counts were made on 30 randomly chosen Hip-
pocrepis comosa plants m each of 15 adjoining  compart-
ments  that  were  grazed  on  rotation  in  1982-86  Plant
height  (Thomas  1983) and  the  number  of  eggs was re-
corded  in each of the 2250 samples

Variation in the abundance of the ant Myrmica sabu-
leti was  recorded  by baiting  or  by pit-fall  trapping  be-
neath  Thymus spp  and Origanum vulgare L  (the early
larval foodplants of Maculinea anon),  in swards of vary-
ing  height  on  land  with  varying  aspects  Ants  were
sampled during the peak evening foraging  period of M
sabuleti beneath  plants  containing  M  arton  eggs,  or
beneath  suitable  oviposition  plants  on  extinct  sites
Pooled  data  are  presented  from  one  occupied  and  six
extinct  M  anon  sites in SW England  (N  =  347),  from
SIX occupied  and  two  unoccupied  sites  in  Dordogne,
France  (N  =  227),  and  from  five  occupied  sites  in
Oland,  Sweden  (N  =  97)

Munguira  (pers  comm  ) descnbed  the sward heights
and aspects inhabited  by L  bellargus and H  comma in
Spain  and south France, and  I recorded  the  occupancy
of  shaded  woods  in  Dordogne  and  the  Rhone  Valley,
France  by the four  species of  fntillary

Microclimate  measurements
I  measured  temperature  in the  niches occupied  by lar-
vae,  and  in  similar  situations  beneath  foodplants  re-
jected  for  oviposition,  in  a  range  of  turf  heights  in
south-facing grassland in south England  Measurements
were made in cloudy-bright  weather  in Apnl  and May,
using a thermocouple, for L  bellargus (Thomas 1983. N
=  67) and M  anon  (new data,  N =  143), and in Octo-
ber using a laser thermometer for H  comma (new data,
N =  58)  Thomas,  C  D  (1983) used  the  former  tech-
nique  for  P  argus on  south-facing  heathland  in  north
Wales

Integrated temperatures were measured m the niches

of B  euphrosyne (N  =  16 x  12) and B  selene (N  =  16
X 12), dunng the  12 wk feeding  period  of their  larvae,
using  Pallman's  sucrose  inversion  method  (Lee  1969)
Measurements  were  made  m  woodland  blocks  m  S
England that had been eut 3 months (B  euphrosyne) or
18 months  (B  selene) earher  Integrated  temperatures
were also measured beneath unsuitable Viola (N = 32 x
12) growing under shrubs that had not been cut for c  15

Climate  change  and  land  management  in  the
Holocene
A  simplified  reconstruction  of  trends  in mean  summer
temperatures m Britain over the past 8000 yr was made
from  the  evidence  of  Sawyer  1966, Pearson  1978, Wi-
gley  et  al  1986,  Grove  1988,  Huntley  and  Prentice
