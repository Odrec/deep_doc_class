Materials and Methods 

 
Expression and purification  
ParM (UniProt PARM_ECOLX), its mutants and ParR (UniProt STBB_ECOLX) were expressed from the plasmids 
pJSC1 and pJSC21, respectively (10), in E. coli BL21-AI cells and purified as described previously (1, 7). Brief 
details of the purification are described below. 
ParM and ParR were finally gel filtrated into a common buffer (Buffer MR: 50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM KCl, and 1 
mM MgCl2, pH 7.0), and this buffer was used in all further experiments. Concentrated aliquots of pure protein were 
frozen and stored at -80 °C.  
Wild type ParM: Wild type ParM was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation (at a final concentration of 10 % 
(sat.)  ammonium  sulfate)  of  the  lysate,  followed  by  addition  of  ATP  to  the  resuspended  pellet. The  polymerized 
ParM was pelleted by centrifugation at 50,000 g, and the resulting pellet containing pure protein was resuspended in 
buffer and gel filtrated on a Sephacryl S-200 column (GE Healthcare). Wild type ParM used for TIRF experiments 
was  purified  from  the  lysate  using  a  HiTrap  Q  HP  column  (GE  Healthcare),  instead  of  ammonium  sulfate 
precipitation. The fractions containing ParM were pooled and further purified using the ATP polymerization step. 
ParM used for ITC and TIRF experiments were treated with EDTA and then gel filtrated on a Superdex 200 10/300 
GL column (GE Healthcare), to ensure complete removal of nucleotide.  
ParM(L163R)  mutant:  The  N-terminally  6xHis-tagged  protein  was  expressed  from  plasmid  pJMJ101  (pTTQ19 
derivative). The protein was purified using a 5 ml HisTrap column (GE Healthcare), and eluted using a gradient of 
imidazole.  The  fractions  containing  ParM  were  pooled  and  further  purified  using  a  HiTrap  Q  HP  column  (GE 
Healthcare), and then dialyzed into 10 mM Tris HCl, 10 mM KCl, 1mM MgCl2, pH 7.5. 
ParM(L163A) mutant: Instead of the polymerization step using ATP in the protocol for the wild type ParM, after 
ammonium  sulfate  precipitation  the  sample  was  purified  using  a  HiTrap  Q  HP  (GE  Healthcare)  column  with 
sufficient dilution to allow binding. The pure fractions were pooled after elution, concentrated and gel filtrated.  
ParM(S19R,G21R) and ParM(S19E,G21E) mutants: the same purification protocol as described for the ParM wild 
type protein was followed. 
ParR: 1,10-phenanthroline was included as a protease inhibitor in the lysis buffer to prevent proteolytic cleavage of 
ParR.  As  described  previously  (7),  the  purification  steps  included  a  HiTrap  Heparin  column  and  HiTrap  SP  HP 
cation  exchange  column,  and  gel  filtration  (Sephacryl  S300,  all  GE  Healthcare).  The  size  of  purified  full-length 
ParR was confirmed by ESMS mass spectrometry since proteolysis occurs easily.  
 
Crystallization, data collection and structure refinement 
Crystallization conditions were identified from a high-throughput screen (25) using 100 nl of protein and 100 nl of 
the crystallization solution, in sitting drop vapor diffusion MRC plates. 
ParM-AMPPNP complex: ParM(L163R) was stored in 10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, pH 7.5, and 5 
mM  AMPPNP  (adenosine  5′-(β,γ-imido)  triphosphate,  tetralithium  salt)  and  10  mM  MgCl2  were  added  prior  to 
crystallization.  Crystals  were  obtained  in  20  %  PEG  6000,  100  mM  Bicine  pH  8.6,  1  M  LiCl,  at  10  mg/ml 

concentration of the protein,  and cryoprotected  with additional 24 % PEG 400. Diffraction data  was collected at 
beamline ID29 (ESRF, Grenoble, France).  
ParM-AMPPNP-ParRpept  complex:  The  protein  sample  for  crystallization  consisted  of  10  mg/ml  (final 
concentration) ParM(L163A) mixed with 5 mM of ParRpept (H2N-EQKSDEETKKNAMKLIN-COOH; residues 101 
to 117 of ParR; Advanced Biomedical Ltd, UK), 10 mM AMPPNP and 10 mM MgCl2. Crystals were obtained in 
0.1  M  citric  acid  pH  5.0,  and  2.4  M  ammonium  sulfate.  The  crystals  were  flash-frozen  in  liquid  nitrogen  after 
cryoprotection using 40 % sodium malonate solution, pH 7.0. Diffraction data were collected at beamline ID14-2 
(ESRF, Grenoble, France).  
The  data  collection  and  refinement  statistics  are  summarized  in  Table  S1.  The  data  sets  were  processed  using 
MOSFLM  (26)  and  molecular  replacement  solutions  were  obtained  using  PHASER  (27).  Model  building  and 
refinement  were  performed  using  COOT  (28)  and  PHENIX  (29),  respectively.  The  quality  of  the  structure  was 
validated using the MolProbity server (30). 
Register of the peptide was confirmed by anomalous dispersion from data collected at beamline I02 (Diamond Light 
Source, Harwell, UK) from a crystal containing selenomethionine (SeMet)-labeled peptide (synthesized with Met-
113 replaced by SeMet; Advanced Biomedicals Ltd., UK; Fig. S2A).  
The coordinates have the Protein Data Bank (PDB) accession codes 4A61 and 4A62 for the ParM-AMPPNP and 
ParM-AMPPNP-ParRpept structures, respectively. 
 
Electron microscopy  
ParM filaments for electron microscopy were prepared by incubating 30 µM protein in 200 µl polymerization buffer 
(30  mM  Tris-HCl,  25  mM  KCl,  2  mM  MgCl2,  1  mM  DTT,  pH  7.5)  with  5  mM  AMPPNP  for  5  min  at  room 
temperature.  The  filaments  were  pelleted  by  centrifugation  for  60  min  at  100,000  g  to  remove  monomers,  and 
resuspended in 40 µl buffer. A 2.1 µl sample solution was applied onto a Quantifoil holey carbon molybdenum grid 
(R0.6/1.0, Quantifoil Micro Tools GmbH, Jena, Germany) and was plunge-frozen into liquid ethane using a fully 
automated vitrification device (Vitrobot, FEI). The specimen was observed at temperatures of 50 – 60 K using a 
JEOL JEM3200FSC electron microscope, which is equipped with a liquid-helium cooled specimen stage, an Ω-type 
energy filter and a field-emission electron gun operated at 200 kV. Zero energy-loss images, with a slit setting to 
remove  electrons  of  an  energy-loss  larger  than  10  eV,  were  recorded on  a  4k  × 4k  15  µm/pixel  slow-scan  CCD 
camera, TemCam-F415MP (TVIPS, Germany) at a magnification of 91,463, a defocus range of 0.7 – 2.0 µm and an 
electron dose of ~20 electrons/Å2. The magnification was calibrated by measuring the layer line spacing of 23.0 Å in 
the Fourier transform of images of tobacco mosaic virus mixed in the sample solution. The image pixel size at this 
magnification was 1.64 Å/pixel. In total of 200 CCD images were collected. 
Defocus and astigmatism in the images were determined using CTFFIND3 (31). Images of the ParM filament from 
the 200 CCD frames were boxed into 20917 segments of 512 × 512 pixels with a step shift of 100 pixels along the 
helical axis using EMAN’s boxer program (32). The in-plane orientation of each ParM filament was retained in the 
segment and recorded in a list to avoid interpolation when rotating the image. Images were then phase-corrected by 
multiplying a phase and amplitude contrast transfer function (CTF) with the astigmatism obtained by CTFFIND3 

(32). We used a ratio of 7 % for the amplitude CTF to the phase CTF (33). This procedure for the CTF correction 
results in the multiplication of the square of the CTF (CTF2) to the original structure factor and suppresses the noise 
around the nodes of the CTF, allowing more accurate image alignment. The amplitude modification by CTF2 was 
corrected in the last stage of image analysis as described later. The images were then high-pass filtered (285 Å) to 
remove  any  low  spatial  frequency  density  undulation,  normalized  and  cropped  to  320  ×  320  pixels.  Image 
processing  was  mainly  carried  out  with  the  SPIDER  package  (34)  on  a PC  cluster  computer  with  40  CPUs  (RC 
server Calm2000, Real Computing, Tokyo, Japan).  
A  series  of  reference  projection  images  were  generated  for  each  reference  volume  by  rotating  the  volume 
azimuthally about the filament axis between 0º and 360º and projecting the volume every 1º to produce all views. 
The raw images of the boxed ParM segments were translationally and rotationally aligned and cross-correlated with 
the set of reference projections to produce the following information: an in-plane rotation angle, an x-shift, a y-shift, 
an  azimuthal  angle  and  a  cross-correlation  coefficient  for  each  segment.  Particles  with  a  small  cross-correlation 
coefficient were discarded. The polarity of the particles was tracked with respect to their respective filament. Even 
with our high contrast imaging technique, the orientation of each individual particle was somewhat ambiguous due 
to the relatively low contrast and high noise level of the segment image. Therefore, the orientation was defined as 
that of the majority of the particles for each filament during each alignment cycle, and all the segments identified to 
have  the  opposite  orientation  were  discarded.  A  3D  reconstruction  was  then  generated  by  back-projection.  The 
symmetry of this new volume was determined by a least-squares fitting algorithm, and this symmetry was imposed 
upon the reconstruction (35). The new  symmetry-enforced volume  was used as a reference for the next round of 
alignment. This process was repeated iteratively until the symmetry values converged to a stable solution.  
In the analysis, the polarities of the segment images were determined reliably. On average, the in-plane angles for 
95% of the segments from a ParM filament showed the same polarity. The initial parameters were an axial rise of 
24.7 Å and an azimuthal rotation angle of 163º along the 1-start helix, and they  were converged to 23.62 Å and 
164.98º,  respectively.  The  resulting  reconstruction  was  then  modified  by  multiplying  the  transform  of  the 
reconstruction by 1/[∑CTF2 + 1/SNR] to compensate for the amplitude distortion by the contrast transfer function. 
The map was sharpened with a B-factor of -200 Å2. Table S2 gives the statistics of the EM reconstruction. 
The atomic coordinates of the filament were obtained by fitting the ParM:ParRpept conformation of the monomer into 
the  filament  map,  and  then  generating  the  rest  of  the  subunits  by  applying  the  helical  parameters.  The  EM 
reconstruction has been deposited in the EMDB (EMD-1980), and the fitted coordinates in the PDB (4A6J). 
 
Isothermal Calorimetry (ITC) 
ITC  experiments  were  performed  using  a  MicroCal  iTC200  machine  with  a  ParM  concentration  of  20  µM  and 
ParRpept at 1 mM in the cell and syringe, respectively. Nucleotide, when included, was added at a concentration of 10 
mM in both the syringe and the cell. An initial injection of 0.5 µl and twenty injections of 2 µl each of the peptide 
were added into the cell at intervals of 120 s with constant stirring at 1000 rpm. The data was analyzed using Origin 
software  as  provided  by  the  manufacturer.  The  estimated  Kd  value  is  the  mean  value  from  three  independent 
measurements.

Fluorescent labeling  
A  single  AlexaFluor 
tag 
(DSLEFIASKLA) at the N-terminus (ParM-Sfp) by site-specific labeling using Sfp synthase (36). CoA-conjugated 
AlexaFluor derivatives  were  synthesized according to (37). Fluorescent labeling  was done by incubation at room 
temperature for 3 hours in a 100 µl reaction mix containing 90 µM ParM-Sfp, 1 mM CoA-conjugated AlexaFluor 
dye, 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, and 2 µM of Sfp synthase. ParM monomers capable of polymerization 
were selected from  the reaction  mix by a few rounds of pelleting at 100,000 g after addition of ATP. The pellet 
obtained was resuspended in buffer containing EDTA and then gel filtrated to remove the excess nucleotide and free 
dye.  The  labeling  efficiency  was  estimated  using  the  ratio  of  absorbance  of  the  protein  and  the  dye  using  a 
NanoDrop ND1000 spectrophotometer. The final concentrations of protein and dye were estimated to be 25 µM and 
0.9 µM for ParM-Alexa568, and 16 µM and 4 µM for ParM-Alexa488. 20 µl aliquots were flash-frozen and stored 
at -80 °C.  
For  labeling  the  ParRC  complex,  YOYO-1  (Molecular  Probes),  a  DNA  intercalating  dye,  was  used  to  label  the 
plasmid  DNA.  200  nM  of  YOYO-1  was  added  to  a  mixture  of  10  µM  of  ParR  and  10  nM  of  parC  (plasmid 
pMD330) (38) in a 50 µl reaction mix. This was dialyzed extensively overnight in 500 ml of buffer, and resulted in 
an  increase  in  volume  to  about  150  µl.  The  labeled  sample  was  freshly  prepared  each  time  and  used  for  TIRF 
microscopy experiments within 24 hours. The formation of the RC complex was confirmed by gel shift assays (data 
not shown). 
For  experiments  with  QDot  labeled  ParRC,  a  385-bp  PCR  product  containing  the  parC  sequence  was  amplified 
using  the  primers  SR14  and  biotinylated-SR15  (7)  with  pMD330  as  template,  for  producing  biotin-tagged  DNA. 
This  was  labeled  using  QDot  545-Streptavidin  conjugate  (Invitrogen),  and  used  for  reconstituting  the  ParRC 
complex at a 1:40 molar ratio of parC to ParR. The concentrations of Q-Dot labelled ParRC mentioned in the text 
refer to the final molar concentration of parC. 
 
TIRF microscopy 
Imaging: Imaging was performed on an Olympus IX71 TIRF microscope, using a 60x 1.49 NA objective, equipped 
with  an  Evolve  EMCCD  camera  (Photometrics).  Micro-Manager  1.4  was  used  for  image  acquisition  (39).  Dual-
channel  images  were  collected  using  a  custom-made  image  splitter  in  the  path  of  the  beam  before  entering  the 
camera. Physical pixel size corresponds to 83 nm in object space after applying the magnification introduced by the 
settings  of  the  microscope  and  the  splitter.  The  images  were  split  into  the  two  channels  using  the  Cairn  Image 
Splitter  plugin  in  Fiji  (http://imageja.sourceforge.net)  based  on  a  reference  image  obtained  from  FocalCheck 
microspheres  (Invitrogen).  The  channels  were  merged  to  obtain  the  composite  images.  Data  were  acquired 
continuously as movies of 500 images at 100 ms exposure time per image. The images were filtered by applying a 
Gaussian blur with a sigma of 1. All image-processing steps involving the stacks of images were performed in Fiji. 
The rates of elongation and disassembly reported were calculated as slope of the kymographs of filaments, and are 
tabulated (Table S3). 

Experimental set-up: A 1:1000 ratio of labeled to unlabeled ParM was maintained in all reactions, in order to obtain 
speckled filaments for better contrast. The speckled appearance also serves as fiducial points. 1 % methylcellulose 
(crowding  agent  to  maintain  the  filaments  in  the  TIRF  field)  was  included  in  Buffer  MR,  and  50  nM 
protocatechuate-3,4-dioxygenase,  2.5  mM  protocatechuic  acid  and  1  mM  of  Trolox  as  antibleach  reagents  (40) 
added to the reaction mix. The final concentration of methylcellulose in the reaction mix was 0.9 % after addition of 
all  other  components  of  the  mixture.  The  reaction  mix  was  transferred  to  a  chamber  of  a  Lab-Tek  8-chambered 
borosilicate  coverslip  system  for  imaging,  immediately  after  initiating  polymerization  by  the  addition  of  the 
nucleotide. The chambers were pre-treated by incubation with 10 mg/ml of β-casein for at least 30 minutes. The 
experiments  for  observing  unwinding  of  the  spindle  were  performed  in  a  reaction  mix  containing  0.45  % 
methylcellulose. 
Dual-label  experiments  for  observing  bidirectional  growth:  Polymerization  was  initiated  in  a  reaction  mix 
containing a single color of Alexa-labeled ParM, and growth of filaments was observed. ParM monomers labeled 
with the second color were added to the chamber while imaging, and the focus was readjusted on a field containing 
dual-labeled  filaments.  The  fluorescence  intensity  of  parts  of  the  filaments  with  the  second  label  was  higher 
compared  to  the  initial  seed  due  to  the  inadequate  mixing  of  the  labeled  ParM  added  later.  The  experiment  was 
performed with and without ParRC. The portion of the filament after the initial seed will contain both the labels, 
since they are both present, with the second label at a higher intensity. Unlabeled ParM concentrations used were in 
the range of 0.4 to 1 µM. ParRC complex was prepared by mixing 5 µM of ParR and 5 nM of pMD330, and 1 to 2 
µl  were  added  to  the  200  µl  reaction  mixture  before  initiating  polymerization  with  2  mM  (final  concentration) 
AMPPNP.  The  rate  of  growth  was  estimated  for  the  two  ends  of  the  same  filament  from  the  slopes  of  the 
kymographs. 
Dual-channel imaging of ParRC at the tip of ParM filaments: Unlabeled ParM concentrations in the range of 0.4 to 
1 µM were used along with 2 to 4 µl of the dialyzed YOYO-1-labeled ParRC complex, in a 200 µl reaction. 2 mM 
AMPPNP or ATP was used as the nucleotide. The rates of spindle elongation and disassembly were estimated from 
the slopes of the lines manually fitted onto the kymographs. parC labeled with streptavidin-conjugated QDot 545 
(Invitrogen) was used for estimating the number of ParM filaments with 0, 1 or 2 ends bound to ParRC. The images 
were  obtained  at  very  low  ParM  concentrations  of  0.35–  0.4  µM  to  minimize  spontaneous  nucleation  of  ParM 
filaments  unaided  by  ParRC.  The  bipolar  spindles  reported  for  ParM  wild-type  and  the  interface  mutants  were 
obtained using Q-Dot labelled ParRC. The rate of spindle elongation was estimated from YOYO-1 labeled ParRC. 
The rates of elongation and disassembly are tabulated in Table S3.

factor analysis to quantitate the fit of ParM:ParRpept and ParM:AMPPNP conformations in the EM reconstruction of 
ParM  filament.  The  monomer  conformations  were  fitted  into  the  EM  reconstruction  with  the  residues  1-148  and 
307-320 of domain I as reference, using Chimera (24). The residue-wise real space R-factor (RSR) of the fit was 

calculated  using  MAPMAN  (Uppsala  Software  Factory;  www.xray.bmc.uu.se/usf),  and  plotted.  The  difference 
between the  R-factors  in domain II  for the  two conformations  is  highlighted. The plot for ParM:ParRpept and the 
overall  real  space  R-factors  (0.33  and  0.47  for  ParM:ParRpept  and  ParM:AMPPNP,  respectively)  confirms  the 
excellent fit of the conformation in the density. 

 

Fig. S2. Interactions between ParM and ParR. 
A) ParRpept binds within a predominantly hydrophobic pocket formed by residues from subdomains IA and IIA, at 
the  polymerization  interface.  The  C-terminal  COOH  moiety  of  ParRpept  interacts  with  Lys-123  of  ParM  (10). 
Superimposed is the anomalous map at 2.5 σ for selenium in the crystal structure of ParM with ParRpept in which 
Met-113 is replaced by seleno-methionine. The position of the peak confirms the register of the peptide fitted into 
the  electron  density  map.  The  figure  is  shown  in  wall-eyed  stereo  and  the  same  color  scheme  as  in  Figure  2  is 
followed.  B-E)  ITC  data  for ParM(L163A)  mutant  titrated  with  ParRpept  in  the  presence  of  AMPPNP  (B),  in  the 
presence of ADP (C), and without nucleotide (D), ParM wild type in the presence of AMPPNP (polymerized ParM) 
(E). The peptide binds with a Kd of 18.5 ± 5.1 µM to a non-polymerizing mutant of ParM(L163A) in the presence of 
AMPPNP, while no binding is detected to polymerized ParM or in the absence of nucleotide or in the presence of 
ADP.  The  flat  binding  curve  when  polymerized  ParM  is  titrated  against  the  peptide  rules  out  the  possibility  of 
peptide-binding along the sides of the filament. Peptide-binding to the filament ends cannot be detected by ITC in 
the experimental conditions used, since the concentration of filament ends in the polymerized sample is too low to 
produce detectable levels of binding energy. 
 
 
 

Fig. S3. Mechanism of ParR-assisted ParM filament elongation. 
A)  A  helix  in  FH2  domain  of  formin  (highlighted  in  dark  pink)  binds  between  subdomains  1  and  3  of  actin, 
corresponding  to  the  interaction  between  ParRpept  and  ParM  (see  also  Figure  2A).  B-C)  The  scaffold  formed  by 
formin and ParRC matches the geometry of the short-pitch helix of actin and ParM. Two adjacent monomers that 
form the short pitch helix are shown for actin and ParM (yellow) along with the formin and ParRC scaffolds (blue; 
cartoon  and  surface  representation),  respectively.  With  allowance  for  the  flexible  stretch  of  residues  between  the 
ParR N-terminal domain and the C-terminal helix, the geometry of the ParRC ring approximates the dimension of 
the  short  pitch  helix  of  ParM  filament.  Residues  1-94  of  the  ParR  N-terminal  domain  are  shown  in  surface  and 
cartoon representation in blue with residues 86-94 highlighted in pink, while the C-terminal helix (residues 101-117) 
bound to ParM is shown in dark pink. Side and bottom views are shown. D) A putative mechanism of ParM filament 
elongation by ParRC. Two ParRs (in green) of the ParRC ring are bound to the filament, while a third ParR (in blue) 
fishes  for  ATP-bound  ParM  monomers  (in  red)  from  the  vicinity.  The  monomer  recruited  into  the  ParRC  ring 
displaces one of the filament-bound ParRs and is incorporated into the filament.  

 
 
Fig. S4. Bipolar spindles are formed by antiparallel ParM filaments. 
A)  More  examples  of  kymographs  corresponding  to  filaments  in  a  dual  label  experiment  with  ParRC  (see  also 
Figure 3B of main text). Boundaries of the filament and the initial seed are highlighted. B) Another example of a 
kymograph from ParM filaments labeled with Alexa-568 and ParRC (green) labeled using YOYO-1 is shown (see 
also Figure 3C). C) More examples of observation of zigzag movement of filaments in kymographs of bundles of 
wild-type ParM filaments (see also Figure 4A). D) More examples of static filaments in kymographs of bundles of 
ParM(S19R,G21R) filaments (see also Figure 4D). E-F) More examples for kymographs of disassembling spindles 
of ParM wild-type (E) and ParM(S19E,G21E) (F). The arrows highlight the slopes of the disassembly events. The 
two steps of disassembly, evident in the kymographs of the partially unpaired ParM(S19E,G21E) mutant spindles, 
have been marked. The two-step disassembly is not evident in the disassembly of most of the wild type spindles, 
since the two component filaments disassemble simultaneously.  

 
Fig. S5. A molecular model for antiparallel ParM filaments. 
A)  A  model  for  filament  condensation.  Subunits  of  ParM  filaments  are  superposed  sequentially  onto  the  ParM 
monomers  in  antiparallel  orientation  (inset)  in  the  crystal  packing  of  the  ParM:ParRpept  complex,  resulting  in 
‘sliding’ and an antiparallel packing of two filaments. The grey arrows indicate the direction of sliding. B) Interfaces 
between the two antiparallel ParM filaments. A segment of the final step of the antiparallel model in (A) is shown in 
the inset and the interfaces between two monomers are numbered.  The details of the numbered interfaces are also 
shown. It should be noted that (1) & (5) and (2) & (4) are similar interfaces. All the interfaces involve loop 18-21 
which  is  the  position  of  the  mutations  designed  in  this  study.      C)  The  12-fold  symmetry  of  the  ParM  helix  is 
compatible  with  a  tight  hexagonal  or  square  packing  of  ParM  filaments.  D-E)  Axial  views  of  antiparallel  ParM 
bundles consisting of 2 (D) and 4 (E) filaments respectively. 

 
 
Fig. S6. A comprehensive model of plasmid segregation by ParMRC. 
A  schematic  diagram  summarizing  the  proposed  events  in  plasmid  segregation  by  ParMRC. 
ParM  goes  through  cycles  of  spontaneous  polymerization  and  depolymerization  through 
nucleation, elongation and dynamic instability (top right). For the filaments to be rescued from 
catastrophic disassembly, they have to be captured by the ParRC complex. We demonstrate here 
that the ParRC complex binds only at the barbed-end of the ParM filament. The other end of the 
filament becomes protected when two filaments come together to form an antiparallel bundle. 
The  result  is  a  bipolar  spindle  with  plasmids  bound  at  each  end  through  the  ParRC  adaptor 
complexes. Addition of new subunits at each end will lead to elongation. The elongating spindle 
grows as a bundle at all times, possibly by concomitant sliding to maximize overlap, and/or by 
addition of ParM monomers at the pointed-end also (inset). Addition of subunits at the pointed-
end  is  facilitated  by  additional  binding  energy  that  is  available  to  the  incoming  subunits, 
provided  by  the  neighboring  filament  in  the  bundle.  In  a  similar  way,  dynamic  instability  is 
stopped by the stabilization of the terminal subunits at the pointed-end through the provision of 
extra  binding  energy  by  the  neighboring  filament.  The  bundles  may  contain  more  than  two 
filaments, in order to segregate larger numbers of plasmids.

‡ The rates with and without ParRC have been estimated from two ends of the same filament. 
§ Filaments are too short and do not remain in evanescent field to determine the rate of growth accurately. 
¶  The  difference  between  rates  of  spindle  elongation  with  YOYO-1  labeled  plasmid  and  PCR  fragment  of  parC 
could be due to the differences in the size of the DNA, and also due to differences in efficiency of ParRC complex 
formed. We found that YOYO-1, an intercalating dye, displaces ParR. 

 

 

 
Movie S1. The ParM:ParRpept conformation fits best into the EM reconstruction of the ParM filament. 
Movie showing a morph between the fit of the ParM:ParRpept and ParM-AMPPNP conformations into a monomer 
segment  of  the  filament  map.  Residues  1-160  and  305-320  of  domain  I  were  used  for  rigid-body  fitting  using 
Chimera (24). The morph shows a clear movement of domain II in the ParM:ParRpept state resulting in a better fit 
compared to the ParM-AMPPNP state. 
 
Movie S2. The Growth of ParM filaments without ParRC is bidirectional and symmetric. 
Alexa488-labeled (green) ParM monomers  were added to filaments growing in the presence of Alexa568-labeled 
(magenta)  ParM  monomers  with  AMPPNP  as  the  nucleotide.  The  movie  was  obtained  using  a  reaction  mix 
containing  0.5  μM  ParM  and  2  mM  AMPPNP.  Figure  3A  in  the  main  text  shows  a  kymograph  of  one  of  the 
filaments  in  the  movie.  The  middle  segments  (initial  seed)  of  the  filaments  become  photobleached  as  the  movie 
progresses,  while  the  intensity  of  the  flanking  growing  ends  are  higher.  The  filament  that  enters  into  the  field 
towards the end of the movie clearly shows the symmetric growth on either end of the initial magenta seed. The 
lengths (in micrometers) of the flanking regions are highlighted at the end of the movie. The movie was made using 
averages of ten original frames. 
 
Movie S3. ParRC accelerates growth unidirectionally, resulting in bidirectional but asymmetric growth. 
ParRC increases the rate of growth of ParM filaments in one of the directions, resulting in asymmetry. Alexa488-
labeled (green) ParM monomers were added to filaments growing in the presence of Alexa568-labeled (magenta) 
ParM monomers and unlabeled ParRC with AMPPNP as the nucleotide. The movie was obtained using a reaction 
mix containing 0.5 μM ParM, 2 mM AMPPNP, and 1 μl of ParRC mixture. The movie was made using averages of 
five original frames. 
 
Movie S4. Insertional polymerization by ParRC. 
ParRC  binds  to  one  end  of  a  single  filament  and  monomers  are  recruited  at  the  ParRC-binding  end,  leading  to 
insertional  polymerization.  ParM  filaments  were  labeled  with  Alexa-568,  while  ParRC  was  labeled  using  the 
intercalating dye YOYO-1. The movie was obtained using a 200 μl reaction mix containing 0.4 μM ParM and 2 mM 
AMPPNP, and 2 μl of back-dialyzed ParRC, labeled with YOYO-1. The movie was made using averages of five 
original frames. 
 
Movies S5 and S6. Filament sliding and bundling of ParM filaments grown in the presence of ATP.  
ParM  filaments  form  bundles  by  interfilament  sliding.  Magenta  arrows  highlight  the  filament  bundles  that  slide 
together to form a bigger bundle. The movies were obtained using a reaction mix containing 2.5 μM ParM and 2 
mM  ATP.  These  bundles  also  exhibit  dynamic  instability  when  individual  filaments  slide  out  of  the  bundle  and 
disassemble. The movies were made using averages of five original frames. 
 
Movies S7 and S8. Filament sliding and bundling of ParM filaments grown in the presence of AMPPNP.  
The  movies  were  obtained  using  a  reaction  mix  containing  2.5  μM  and  4  μM  ParM,  respectively,  with  2  mM 
AMPPNP. Six observations of sliding events are highlighted in Movie S7. Movie S7 was made using averages of 
three original frames. Figure 4A shows a montage from Movie S8. 
 
Movies S9 and S10. To and fro sliding in bundles of ParM filaments. 
Continuous  motion  of  labeled  monomers  within  ParM  filament  bundles,  due  to  growth  followed  by  sliding.  The 
movies  were  obtained  with  samples  containing  2.5  μM  and  4  μM  ParM  respectively,  and  2  mM  AMPPNP. The 
kymographs in Figure 4B and Figure S4C correspond to filaments from Movie S9. 
 
Movie S11. To and fro sliding of ParM filaments in two colors. 
Two  separate  samples  of  ParM  at  2.5  μM  concentration,  containing  Alexa488  and  Alexa568  labeled  monomers 
respectively,  were  polymerized  using  2  mM  AMPPNP,  and  then  added  to  opposite  corners  of  the  experimental 
chamber. The sample was observed at different regions of the chamber, to observe smaller filaments labeled with 

Alexa488 sliding over thicker bundles labeled with Alexa568. Two channels (488 nm and 561 nm), and their merge 
are shown.  
 
Movie S12. Filament sliding does not occur in bundles of the ParM(S19R,G21R) mutant. 
ParM(S19R,G21R) was polymerized at the same conditions as the wild type (Movie S7), at 2.5 μM concentration 
with 2 mM AMPPNP. The filaments within the bundles do not slide. Longer bundles are observed since the bundles 
do not slide against each other and condense. 
 
Movies S13 and S14. Bipolar spindles formed by ParM in the presence of ParRC and ATP. 
Elongating spindles formed by samples containing 0.5 μM ParM and 2.5 nM Q-Dot labeled ParRC, and polymerized 
with 2 mM ATP are shown. The movies were made using averages of three original frames. 
 
Movies S15 and S16. Spindle disassembly triggered by detachment of ParRC. 
The  detachment  of  ParRC  leads  to  disassembly  of  the  bipolar  spindle.  The  movies  were  obtained  using  samples 
containing low concentrations of wild type ParM (0.35 μM), 2.5 nM Q-Dot labeled ParRC, polymerized with 2 mM 
ATP. 
 
Movie S17. A bipolar spindle is formed by two antiparallel ParM filaments. 
Spindles obtained using ParM(S19E,G21E) mutant are unstable, and disassemble due to unpairing of the filaments 
in the spindle. The movie shows an example in which the component filaments separate, clearly demonstrating that 
the spindle is composed of two antiparallel ParM filaments, with ParRC bound at one end of each. The splitting of 
the filaments leads to unstable (pointed) ends, leading to dynamic instability of ParM filaments, and disassembly of 
the spindle. The movie was obtained at 0.5 μM ParM(S19E,G21E), 2.5 nM Q-Dot labeled ParRC, and polymerized 
with 2 mM ATP, and the sample buffer contained 0.45 % methylcellulose. It may be required to watch this movie 
frame-by-frame in order to be able to follow all events. 
 
Movie S18. Two-step disassembly of ParM filaments in a bipolar spindle. 
Disassembly  is  triggered  in  one  of  the  filaments  in  a  spindle  obtained  using  ParM(S19E,G21E)  mutant  due  to 
detachment of ParRC (top). The disassembly in this filament is followed by the disassembly of the other filament 
due  to  loss  of  the  stabilizing  interaction  with  the  paired  filament.  The  distinct  disassembly  events  of  the  two 
filaments are clearly observed because of the partial unpairing of the filaments in the mutant. In a wild-type spindle, 
it is very difficult to distinguish the disassembly of the two component filaments since they support each other for 
stability  and  disassemble  simultaneously.  The  movie  was  obtained  at  0.5  μM  ParM(S19E,G21E),  2.5  nM  Q-Dot 
labeled ParRC, and polymerized with 2 mM ATP, and the sample buffer contained 0.45 % methylcellulose. Spindles 
of wild type ParM do not unwind under the same conditions. It may be required to watch this movie frame-by-frame 
in order to be able to follow all events. 
 
Movie S19. Spindle disassembly triggered by unpairing of filaments. 
Another  example  of  a  spindle  formed  by  ParM(S19E,  G21E)  mutant  that  disassembles  due  to  unpairing  of  the 
filaments. The filaments slide apart, leading to disassembly of the spindle. The filament ends are marked using white 
and yellow arrowheads to highlight the sliding event. The movie was obtained at 0.5 μM ParM(S19E,G21E), 2.5 nM 
Q-Dot labeled ParRC, and polymerized with 2 mM ATP and the sample buffer contained 0.45 % methylcellulose. It 
may be required to watch this movie frame-by-frame in order to be able to follow all events.
