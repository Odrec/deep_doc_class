so   fundamental   that   the   State   must   accord   them   its
respect. . . .

Justice KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.

The Constitution promises liberty to all within its
reach, a liberty that includes certain specific rights that
allow   persons,   within   a   lawful   realm,   to   define   and
express their identity. The petitioners in these cases seek
to find that liberty by marrying someone of the same sex
and having their marriages deemed lawful on the same
terms and conditions as marriages between persons of the
opposite sex.

I

These cases come from Michigan, Kentucky, Ohio,
and Tennessee, States that define marriage  as a union
between   one   man   and   one   woman.   See,  e.g.,  Mich.
Const., Art. I, § 25; Ky. Const. § 233A; Ohio Rev.Code
Ann. § 3101.01 (Lexis 2008); Tenn. Const., Art. XI, § 18.
The petitioners are 14 same-sex couples and two men
whose same-sex partners are deceased. The respondents
are state officials responsible for enforcing the laws in
question. The petitioners claim the respondents violate the
Fourteenth  Amendment   by   denying   them   the   right   to
marry or to have their marriages, lawfully performed in
another State, given full recognition. . . .

Under   the   Due   Process   Clause   of   the   Fourteenth
Amendment, no State shall “deprive any person of life,
liberty,   or  property,  without  due  process  of   law.”  The
fundamental   liberties   protected   by  this   Clause   include
most of the rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights. See
Duncan v. Louisiana,  391 U.S. 145, 147–149, 88 S.Ct.
1444, 20 L.Ed.2d 491 (1968). In addition these liberties
extend to certain personal choices central to individual
dignity   and   autonomy,   including   intimate   choices   that
define personal identity and beliefs. See, e.g., Eisenstadt
v. Baird,  405 U.S. 438, 453, 92 S.Ct. 1029, 31 L.Ed.2d
349 (1972); Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 484–
486, 85 S.Ct. 1678, 14 L.Ed.2d 510 (1965).

The   identification   and   protection   of   fundamental
rights is an enduring part of the judicial duty to interpret
the Constitution. That responsibility, however, “has not
been reduced to any formula.”  Poe v. Ullman,  367 U.S.
497, 542, 81 S.Ct. 1752, 6 L.Ed.2d 989 (1961) (Harlan,
J.,   dissenting).   Rather,   it   requires   courts   to   exercise

Applying these established tenets, the Court has long
held the right to marry is protected by the Constitution. In
Loving v. Virginia,  388 U.S. 1, 12, 87 S.Ct. 1817, 18
L.Ed.2d   1010   (1967),   which   invalidated   bans   on
interracial unions, a unanimous Court held marriage is
“one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly
pursuit of happiness by free men.” The Court reaffirmed
that holding in Zablocki v. Redhail, 434 U.S. 374, 384, 98
S.Ct. 673, 54 L.Ed.2d 618 (1978), which held the right to
marry was burdened by a law prohibiting fathers who
were behind on child support from marrying. The Court
again applied this principle in Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S.
78, 95, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987), which held
the right to marry was abridged by regulations limiting
the privilege of prison inmates to marry. Over time and in
other contexts, the Court has reiterated that the right to
marry is fundamental under the Due Process Clause. See,
e.g., M.L.B. v. S.L. J., 519 U.S. 102, 116, 117 S.Ct. 555,
136 L.Ed.2d 473 (1996); Cleveland Bd. of Ed. v. LaFleur,
414 U.S. 632, 639–640, 94 S.Ct. 791, 39 L.Ed.2d 52
(1974); Griswold, supra, at 486; Skinner v. Oklahoma ex
rel. Williamson,  316 U.S. 535, 541, 62 S.Ct. 1110, 86
L.Ed. 1655 (1942);  Meyer v. Nebraska,  262 U.S. 390,
399, 43 S.Ct. 625, 67 L.Ed. 1042 (1923).

It cannot be denied that this Court's cases describing
the   right   to   marry   presumed   a   relationship   involving
opposite-sex partners. The Court, like many institutions,
has made assumptions defined by the world and time of
which it is a part. . . . 

Still,   there   are   other,   more   instructive   precedents.
This   Court's   cases   have   expressed   constitutional
principles of broader reach. In defining the right to marry
these cases have identified essential attributes of that right
based   in   history,   tradition,   and   other   constitutional
liberties   inherent   in   this   intimate   bond.   See,
 e.g.,
Lawrence,  539   U.S.,   at   574;  Turner,   supra,  at   95;
Zablocki, supra, at 384; Loving, supra, at 12; Griswold,
supra,  at 486. And in assessing whether the force and
rationale of its cases apply to same-sex couples, the Court
must respect the basic reasons why the right to marry has
been long protected. See, e.g., Eisenstadt, supra, at 453–
454; Poe, supra, at 542–553 (Harlan, J., dissenting).

This analysis compels the conclusion that same-sex
couples   may   exercise   the   right   to   marry.   The   four
principles and traditions to be discussed demonstrate that
the   reasons   marriage   is   fundamental   under   the
Constitution apply with equal force to same-sex couples.

A first premise of the Court's relevant precedents is
that the right to personal choice regarding marriage is
inherent   in   the   concept   of   individual   autonomy.   This
abiding connection between marriage and liberty is why
Loving  invalidated   interracial  marriage   bans   under   the
Due   Process   Clause.   See   388   U.S.,   at   12;   see   also
Zablocki, supra, at 384 (observing Loving held “the right
to   marry   is   of   fundamental   importance   for   all
individuals”).   Like   choices   concerning   contraception,
family relationships, procreation, and childrearing, all of
which   are   protected   by   the   Constitution,   decisions
concerning marriage are among the most intimate that an
individual   can   make.   See  Lawrence,   supra,  at   574.
Indeed, the Court has noted it would be contradictory “to
recognize a right of privacy with respect to other matters
of family life and not with respect to the decision to enter
the relationship that is the foundation of the family in our
society.” Zablocki, supra, at 386. . . . 

A second principle in this Court's jurisprudence is
that the right to marry is fundamental because it supports
a two-person union unlike any other in its importance to
the   committed   individuals.   This   point   was   central   to
Griswold   v.   Connecticut,  which   held   the   Constitution
protects the right of married couples to use contraception.
381   U.S.,   at   485.   Suggesting   that   marriage   is   a   right
“older   than   the   Bill   of   Rights,”  Griswold  described
marriage this way:

“Marriage is a coming together for better or for worse,
hopefully enduring, and intimate to the degree of being
sacred. It is an association that promotes a way of life,
not causes; a harmony in living, not political faiths; a
bilateral loyalty, not commercial or social projects. Yet
it   is   an   association   for   as   noble   a   purpose   as   any
involved in our prior decisions. “ Id., at 486. . . . 

A third basis for protecting the right to marry is that
it   safeguards   children   and   families   and   thus   draws
meaning from related rights of childrearing, procreation,
and education. See Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S.
510, 45 S.Ct. 571, 69 L.Ed. 1070 (1925);  Meyer,  262
U.S., at 399. The Court has recognized these connections
by describing the varied rights as a unified whole: “[T]he
right to ‘marry, establish a home and bring up children’ is
a central part of the liberty protected by the Due Process
Clause.”    Zablocki,  434   U.S.,   at   384  (quoting  Meyer,
supra, at 399). Under the laws of the several States, some
of  marriage's  protections for  children  and families are
material.   But   marriage   also   confers   more   profound
benefits. By giving recognition and legal structure to their
parents'   relationship,   marriage   allows   children   “to
understand the integrity and closeness of their own family
and its concord with other families in their community
and in their daily lives.” Windsor, supra, at –––– (slip op.,

at 23). Marriage also affords the permanency and stability
important   to   children's   best   interests.   See   Brief   for
Scholars of the Constitutional Rights of Children as Amici
Curiae 22–27. . . .

Fourth and finally . . . 

The right to marry is fundamental as a matter of
history and tradition, but rights come not from ancient
sources   alone.  They  rise,   too,   from   a   better   informed
understanding of how constitutional imperatives define a
liberty that remains urgent in our own era. Many who
deem   same-sex   marriage   to   be   wrong   reach   that
conclusion based on decent and honorable religious or
philosophical premises, and neither they nor their beliefs
are   disparaged   here.   But   when   that   sincere,   personal
opposition becomes enacted law and public policy, the
necessary consequence is to put the imprimatur of the
State   itself   on   an   exclusion   that   soon   demeans   or
stigmatizes those whose own liberty is then denied. Under
the Constitution, same-sex couples seek in marriage the
same   legal   treatment   as   opposite-sex   couples,   and   it
would   disparage   their   choices   and   diminish   their
personhood to deny them this right.

IV

There may be an initial inclination in these cases to
proceed   with   caution—to   await   further   legislation,
litigation, and debate. The respondents warn there has
been insufficient democratic discourse before deciding an
issue so basic as the definition of marriage. In its ruling
on the cases now before this Court, the majority opinion
for the Court of Appeals made a cogent argument that it
would be appropriate for the respondents' States to await
further public discussion and political measures before
licensing same-sex marriages. See  DeBoer,  772 F.3d, at
409. . . .

The   dynamic   of   our   constitutional   system   is   that
individuals   need   not   await   legislative   action   before
asserting  a   fundamental   right. The   Nation's   courts   are
open   to   injured   individuals   who   come   to   them   to
vindicate their own direct, personal stake in our basic
charter. An individual can invoke a right to constitutional
protection when he or she is harmed, even if the broader
public disagrees and even if the legislature refuses to act.
The idea of the Constitution “was to withdraw certain
subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy, to
place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials
and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by
the courts.” West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U.S.
624, 638, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 87 L.Ed. 1628 (1943). This is
why “fundamental rights may not be submitted to a vote;
they depend on the outcome of no elections.” Ibid. It is of
no moment whether advocates of same-sex marriage now
