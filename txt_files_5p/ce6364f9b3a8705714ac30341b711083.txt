1. Introduction 
 
This excerpt deals with the grammar of adjectives with regard to secondary 
school students. All examples are taken from the British National Corpus (BNC) and 
are  categorized  as  classroom  interaction  and  academic  writings  respectively.  The 
purpose of Second Language Education shall not only focus on the mere study and 
transfer  of  rules  but  need  to  include  greater  amounts  of  genuine  listening  and 
speaking situations. To do so, students need to develop—and ultimately achieve—
certain competences that are defined in the “Niedersächsisches Kerncurriculum für 
das Gymnasium – gymnasiale Oberstufe im Fach Englisch”. One of the main areas 
of  competence  consists  of  functional-communicative  skills:  “Im  Englischunterricht 
ist  die  sprachliche  und  interkulturelle  Handlungsfähigkeit  das  übergeordnete  Ziel. 
Erfolgreiches sprachliches Handeln umfasst die Fähigkeit zu Rezeption, Produktion 
und Interaktion.” The highest communicative competence lies within the ability to 
successfully deal with native speakers and hence develop communication skills that 
range from B2 to C1 according to the “Common European Framework of Reference 
for Languages: Learning, Teaching, Assessment” (CEFR). 
 
Therefore,  the  following  explanations  intend  to  not  only  show  written 
communication  but  at  the  same  time  showcase  spoken  interaction.  Henceforth,  the 
aim of this grammar is to illustrate a variety of adjectives that are commonly used by 
native speakers to allow students to develop native-like skills. We, the authors, intend 
to  hand  the  learner  a  toolbox  of  adjectives  that  they  can  use  in  educational  and 
academic contexts.  
In the following this grammar will show how to use an adjective, where to 
 
put it in the sentence structure and finally about the different types of meaning that 
may derive from one specific German term like “schön”.

As  you  will  have  realised,  the  two  lists  do  not  agree.  Accordingly,  some 
adjectives  are  preferably  used  in  spoken  language  and  others  in  written  language. 
Chapter 4 will tell you about overlaps and categories of meaning.  
 
The  following  Figure  shows  overlaps  (marked  in  blue)  between  these  two 
dimensions of adjectival usage considering the above mentioned TOP 50 adjectives.

3. Positions and Functions 
 
verbs (predicative). Some adjectives can only be used predicatively: 

Adjectives  appear  either  before  a  noun  (attributive)  or  after  certain  linking 

 

The woman was alone ✅  vs. I saw an alone woman. ❌          

In contrast, some adjectives are restricted to attributive position only: 

The very thought of her made him smile ✅  vs. The thought of her was very. ❌  

 
An adjective is typically identified by its form. However, adjectives appear 
with various prefixes (e. g. alive) and suffixes (e. g. endless). The following tables 
show the most frequently used adjectives in spoken and written language that occur 
in  predicative  and  attributive  position  (overlaps  between  the  different  areas  are 
marked in blue).

4. Types of Meaning—Distinctive Synonyms 
 
Many adjectives seem to carry the same meaning, but differ in the way they 
are used. Their connections to different nouns, modifiers or other adjectives show the 
slight  distinction  between  their  meanings.  For  instance,  the  adjectives  beautiful, 
handsome and pretty do all describe the positive outward appearance of someone or 
something, but they are used in combination with different words: 

beautiful landscape ✅  vs. beautiful prince ❌  

incredibly beautiful ✅  vs. incredibly handsome  ❌  

Table  6  depicts  the  most  frequent  collocational  usage  of  beautiful,  handsome,  and 
pretty with nouns, whereas Table 7 refers to the usage with modifiers (adverbs). As 
these adjectives describe the outward appearance of someone or something, they all 
collocate with the verbs “look” and “be”. Additionally, beautiful is often used with 
the  verbs  “stay”,  “sound”,  “seem”,  “become”,  “make”,  and  “feel”.  Subsequent  to 
each  Table  there  will  be  a  RULE  OF  THUMB  to  highlight  the  most  important 
features.

RULE OF THUMB 
 
The  adjective  beautiful  predominantly 
 
collocates  with  female  nouns,  such  as  “girl”  and 
“woman”,  whereas  handsome  belongs  to  the  male 
counterpart, e.g. “husband”, “fellow” and “man”. Pretty is also mainly used with 
counterpart
female nouns:  “girl”, “maid”, “lady”, “dress”. Moreover, beautiful and pretty also 
often  serve  as  positive  description  of  surroundings  like  “garden  and  “island”. 
Handsome can also serve within a financial context. For example: 

He was paid a handsome salary. 

Ford expects handsome profits from its phone business.

#$

RULE OF THUMB  
 
 
All three adjectives can be modified by “very”, “so” or “rather”. In addition, 
beautiful and handsome often collocate with modifiers, which increase the positive 
meaning  of  these  adjectives.  These  can  be  adverbs  like  for  example  “extremely”, 
“strikingly” and “exceptionally”. Moreover, there are certain exceptional collocations 
such as “classically beautiful” and “naturally beautiful”.

Table 8 depicts the most frequent collocational usage of fast, quick, and rapid with 
nouns, whereas Table 9 refers to the usage with modifiers (adverbs). Subsequent to 
each  Table  there  will  be  a  RULE  OF  THUMB  to  highlight  the  most  important 
features. Some useful exceptional collocations are: 

“fast and furious” 
“quick and easy” 
“faster than light” 
“quick as a flash”

#$

RULE OF THUMB 
 
 
The  adjective  fast  semantically  belongs  to  “pace”,  “speed”  and  “tempo”. 
Also, it correlates with the vehicle producing the speed (“car”) or the place, where it 
is produced (“lane” and “track”). 

SEITENZAHLEN! Harder, Kakarli, Kaufmann, Ruf 

Quick is rather used in communication between people. This communication 
 
can  be  verbal  (“quick  response”,  “quick  call”)  or  wordless,  e.  g.  “quick  glance”, 
“quick smile”, “quick nod”.  
Comparing these two, fast occurs in the meaning of physical speed (e. g. “fast 
 
bowler”, “fast runner”) whereas quick describes mental ability (“fast thinking”, “fast 
wit”, “fast learner”).   
Contrary to quick and fast, the adjective rapid isn’t primarily used to describe 
 
haptic  movements.  It  is  frequently  used  in  economic  or  financial  contexts  like  the 
following  collocations  show:  “rapid  expansion”,  “rapid  increase”,  “rapid  change”, 
“rapid industrialization” and “rapid inflation”.

#$

RULE OF THUMB 
 
 
The meaning of fast, quick and rapid is frequently strengthened by adverbs 
like “incredibly”, “extremely” and “extraordinarily”. Quick and rapid also occur with 
modifiers, which slightly weaken their meaning. For example:  

relatively quick and fairly rapid

#$

RULE OF THUMB 
 
 
From  a  semantic  perspective  the  adjective  huge  often  refers  to  nouns 
describing a high number or quantity of something (e. g. huge amount/sum/number/
increase/variety/crowd/audience). 
Likewise,  the  adjectives  large  and  great  collocate  with  similar  nouns  (e.  g. 
 
large  with  “number”,  “amount”  and  “quantity”  as  well  as  great  with  “number”, 
“majority” and “variety”) to describe the quantity of something. 
But large and great are additionally used to describe dimensions of space. Especially 
large  frequently  fulfills  this  meaning,  for  example  in  combination  with  “extent”, 
“area”, “part”, “room”, “volume” and “size”. 
Mainly,  the  meaning  of  great  is  closely  connected  to  “important”  or 
 
“significant”. Great carries this meaning when used with nouns like great deal/thing/
difficulty/success.  It  also  serves  in  emotional  contexts,  like  for  example  with 
“interest”, “pleasure” and “fun” and is also often used with “degree”, “extent” and 
“part”. 
Big can also emphasize the significance of something in collocations like big 
 
problem/deal/difference/mistake. Into the bargain, it is frequently used with events 
like  for  example  “game”  and  “race”.  Of  course  it  can  also  be  used  to  describe 
physical size (e. g. “house”, city”, “man”, etc.).

RULE OF THUMB 
 
 
Large, big and great can be strengthened by adverbs like “much”, “very” and 
“really”  or  slightly  weakened  in  their  meaning  by  adverbs  such  as  “fairly”, 
“slightly”, “rather”, “relatively”, etc. They can also be supported by modifiers like 
for example “considerably”, “especially” and “extremely”. Moreover, it is noticeable 
that  large  is  often  used  with  adverbs,  which  emphasize  the  largeness  to  be  an 
exception or really special. For instance: unusually/disproportionally/considerably/
exceptionally  large.  In  addition,  both  large  and  great  frequently  collocate  with 
“infinitely”.
