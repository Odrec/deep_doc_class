Ab s t ra c t    

 

Since 1992, favela tourism in Rio de Janeiro is becoming increasingly popular, especially among 

international travelers. However, academic debates often condemn this form of tourism as a form 

of  exploitative  voyeurism.  This  study  intends  to  contribute  to  a  better  understanding  of  the 

phenomenon of favela tourism based on the community perspective in the favelas Rocinha and 

Pereira da Silva.  

The  emerging  paradigm  of  transmodernity  provides  the  theoretical  umbrella  to  support  this 

research;  keeping  in  mind  that  from  a  transmodern  perspective,  tourism  can  be  seen  as  a 

platform for dialogue and social transformation, the aim of this exploratory study was to expose 

the  social  dimension  of  favela  tourism  and  investigate  its  possible  contribution  to  stimulating 

social  transformation.  Results  showed  that  under  certain  circumstances,  favela  tourism  could 

indeed  support  processes  of  transformation  in  favelas.  Given  local  acceptance  of  and  control 

over the development of touristic activities, this study provides indications that favela tourism can 

lead to open a path for  improving the social representation of favela residents.  

Hence,  although  it  needs  to  be  acknowledged  that  the  complex  issue  of  tourism  in  regions  of 

extreme  poverty  deserves  critical  academic  debate,    this  study  points  to  evidence  that  tourism 

can  have  also  make  positive  social  contributions  in  vulnerable  areas.  The  outcomes  of  this 

research therefore contribute to shedding new light on the topic of favela tourism and to a better 

understanding of the complexity of favelas as an object of study.  

Keywords: favela tourism; community perspective; participation; tourism development;

1.1 Introduction to the Research Topic  

 

Under the  umbrella  of  slum  tourism  the  object  of  this  research is  favela  tourism in Brazil, more 

precisely  in  Rio  de  Janeiro.  This  city  is  one  of  the  main  tourism  attractions  of  Brazil  and  since 

1992 tours into favelas have started to be one of the many activities that tourists can undertake 

in  such  a  lively  city.  Since  then,  tourism  inside  favelas  has  become  a  growing  activity  and  can 

assume  different  forms  (Kuiphuis,  2010).  In  fact,  according  to  Souza  (2006)  for  more  than  a 

century slums have existed in Rio de Janeiro and represent the worst and the best that the city 

has to offer. Although those neighbourhoods are controlled by gangster groups, they are also the 

stage of some of the richest cultural manifestation in Brazil. 

In opposition to the main stream tourism, slum tours can represent an alternative form of visiting 

a  country  and  getting  to  know  the  culture.  However,  this  form  of  tourism  raises  many  ethical 

dilemmas and despite its growing popularity there is much criticism in relation to this recent form 

of  tourism  and  it  is  seen  by  researchers  and  journalists  as  quite  a  controversial  topic  (Freire-

Medeiros,  2009).  As  pointed  out  by  the  same  author  (Cejas),  as  a  research  object,  Favela 

tourism,  is  quite  challenging  because  it  is  composed  of  several  ambiguities  and  contradictions. 

The  aim  of  this  study  is  to  expose  the  complexities  of  such  phenomenon  based  on  the  host 

communities’ perspective. Furthermore it will explore the potential of favela tourism as a vehicle 

for social transformation of favela dwellers. The final contribution of this research is to bring some 

enlightenment into the recent topic of favela tourism by clarifying some of the assumptions that 

surround this matter.  

 

1.2 Problem Statement  

 

Favela tourism only recently became an object of academic research, therefore there is still room 

for  more  scientific  findings.  As  already  mentioned,  so  far  this  activity  is  very  controversial  and 

contested in the Brazilian society. The lack of research done can justify the strong assumptions 

that surround favela tourism (Freire-Medeiros, 2009). For that reason, the role of researchers is 

extremely important regarding this topic because it can help to bring some clarification about it. 

Each study carried out can represent a small step in a better understanding of this phenomenon 

and in breaking some preconceived ideas regarding slum tourism in general and favela tourism 

in particular.  

1 
 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
So  far,  the  many  criticisms  done  about  favela  tourism  have  been  made  by  outsiders 

(researchers,  citizens,  journalists,  tourists  among  others)  about  other  outsiders  (tourists  and 

external agencies).  Nevertheless, if more information coming from host residents could become 

available much easier would it be to actually understand what favela tourism is about and in what 

contexts is taking place. Therefore, the proposal of this study is to obtain an insight into how the 

community perceives favela tourism.  

Other  motives  also  contributed  to  the  reason  for  selecting  community  as  the  main  research 

target.  First,  seldom  does  the  research  that  it  was  possible  to  find,  take  into  account  the 

community  perspective.  Secondly,  the  fact  that  my  mother  tongue  is  Portuguese  highly 

contributed to this choice. The possibility of interacting with the community became an advantage 

instead of an obstacle. I wanted to give a voice to the favela dwellers and gain insight into how 

they  perceived  tourism  because  for  me  they  are  the  most  important  actor  who  hardly  have  a 

chance  to  speak.  Finally,  with  this  study  I  intend  to  contribute  to  a  better  understanding  of  this 

topic and to explore the positive side of favela tourism, more specifically as a potential agent for 

social transformation of favela dwellers.  

 

1.3 Research Objectives  

 

This research has two objectives. First to challenge existing assumptions found in the literature 

regarding this topic and secondly to explore the complexities of favela tourism and understand if 

tourism can and till what extend potentially stimulate a social transformation of favela residents.  

The  favelas  Rocinha  and  Pereira  da  Silva  were  the  selected  case  studies  to  conduct  this 

research.  

Main research question 

Can favela tourism possibly contribute to initiate a social transformation of favela residents? 

Sub research questions:  

-  Can tourism in favelas be a gate for a more positive representation of favela residents? 

-  Can tourism in favelas have a social impact in the host communities? 

-  What does tourism represent for favela dwellers? 

-  How do they perceive the presence of tourism activities in their favelas?

2.1. Introduction 

This chapter corresponds to the theoretical pillar that will sustain the findings of the primary data 

collection.  The  literature  review  will  give  an  overview  of  the  theory  and  concepts  grounded  by 

several  scholars  with different  visions. The  goal  is,  after giving  a general  background,  to  clarify 

how this abstract knowledge is shaped according to the objectives of this current study.  

 

2.2 Mystifying, Representing and Commodifying Favelas 

 

The  connection  between  favelas  with  tourism  may  seem  odd  or  even  bizarre  to  some  people. 

Besides the moral and ethical dilemmas that surrounds favela tourism one of the most intriguing 

aspects is to understand how a vulnerable area like a favela has become a tourism commodity. 

In  order  to  understand  it,  is  necessary  to  explain  the  aestheticization  process  that  favelas  had 

been  target  of.  It  can  justify  why  despite  the  origins,  favelas  can  still  be  seen  by  others  as  an 

exotic place and a desirable object for consumption. To get a better insight of such a paradoxical 

phenomenon, the role of the media must be taken into account. 

The  image  of  the  favela  became  internationally  popularized  by  the  movie,  realised  in  2002,  

“Cidade  de  Deus”  (City  of  God)  that  portrays  what  is  supposed  to  be  a  true  story  of  life  in  the 

Rio’s slums. The fact that it was based on a book from a former resident of Cidade de Deus (that 

is  what  the  slum  is  called)  and  that  many  actors  were  favela  kids  attributed  a  great  authentic 

feeling to this movie. Its impact is also pointed out by many tour operators that claim that “Cidade 

de Deus” is responsible for the increase of interest in the favelas as a tourist attraction (Freire-

Medeiros,  2006).  Furthermore,  there  are  also  other  actors  that  have  an  active  role  in  the 

aestheticization  process.  The  award  winning  documentary  “Favela  Rising”,  tells  the  story  of  an 

afro reggae group from the favela Vigário Geral. An interesting point is, that in many parts of the 

film a different favela, with beautiful views, is replacing Vigário Geral. Therefore, we can see how 

the  visual  aesthetics  of  the  favela  are  created  to  amaze  an  audience  that  later  on,  will  be 

seduced with the chance of facing a similar scenario in a favela tour. The list of examples moves 

on,  and  takes  us  to  a  train  station  in  Paris  that  hosted  the  project  named  Favelité  installation, 

which  corresponds  to  a  collection  of  pictures  taken  by  young  photographers  that  once  lived  in 

favelas.  The  international  night  club  named  Favela  Chic  that  exists  in  Paris,  London,  Glasgow 

and Miami also uses the label favela to sell an exotic image. Once asked why  such name was 

used,  the  manager  answered:  “Our  intension  was  to  show  what  a  favela  really  is,  what    the 

people  needs  are,  what    recycling  is  […]  All  of  our  decoration  is  based  on  recycling.  Our  work 

has the intension of improving the situation [...] to show that favela is valuable, that the dignity we 

3 
 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
preach does  exist.  It’s  not  shameful  anymore  to  speak  about  favelas.Favela  is  luxury,  favela is 

chic!”  (Freire-Medeiros,  2006,  p.  12).  It  Is  also  possible  to  find  a  restaurant  named  Favela  in 

Tokyo and another nightclub in Germany known as Club Favela. In the music field, it is important 

to mention the clip of the king of Pop Michael Jackson, “They don’t care about us” that was shot 

in morro Santa Marta and was highly criticized at that time by the Brazilian government (Freire-

Medeiros,  2006)  During  the  2009  Brazilian  Contemporary  Art  summer  festival  in  Rotterdam 

several pictures and videos about favelas and their dwellers were part of the show.  

Even Brazilian products that desire to be commercialized outside their country are adjusting their 

marketing  strategy  and  are  adopting  favela  as  their  label  (Freire-Medeiros,  2007).  In  fact, 

according  to  the  author  (2007:4),  “The  force  of  the  favela  brand  has  become,  as  we  can  see, 

capable  of  transcending  geographical  and  territorial  referential,  promoting  Brazil  as  well  as 

anything wishing to present itself as alternative, hip”.  

It  is  possible  to  interpret  this  internationalization  of  favela  in  a  political  dimension  as  Williams 

Claire  (2003)  claims,  after  years  of  neglect,  social  stigma  and  struggle,  the  favela  is  definitely 

becoming  the  dominant cultural  image  of  Brazil  at  an  international level  and  that  represents  its 

triumphant revenge. In fact, it is very interesting to see the reflection of the inverted logic that has 

always been part of the favela and other places with the same negative connotations. What was 

once  the  most  shameful  side  of  Rio  de  Janeiro  city,  which  Governments  tried  so  hard  to  keep 

away  from  citizens,  and  especially  outsiders’  view,  now  has  crossed  all  possible  barriers  and 

represents Brazil outside borders.  

According  to  Freire-Medeiros  in  a  post-modern  society,  characterized  by  the  deconstruction  of 

the  rationalism  that  dominated  the  modern  paradigm,  Favelas  has  gained  the  status  of  being 

cool. That image is represented in many ways in the international panorama, resulting in a strong 

fixation for consuming such representation. It is part of the global image to associate favela with 

a multi-cultural environment, samba, funk, warm people, beautiful girls, tropical landscapes and 

at the same time with danger, violence, traffic and poverty. This binary, almost bipolar image of 

the  favela,  is  the  main  ingredient  that  turns  it  into  a  new  meca  for  tourists  in  Rio  de  Janeiro 

(Freire-Medeiros, 2006). Favelas are now a trademark whose image is associated to a range of 

products and services. Despite the possibility of this irreverent shift in the favelas image be seen 

as being “breeze of fresh air” it is important to reflect on the risk of  this representation being as 

injurious as the assumptions of favelados being “lazy” and “potential criminals”. 

Elements that symbolize favela culture such as capoeira, samba, flip flop shoes and funk music 

are consumed internationally and also by Brazilians regardless of social class.  Due to the great 

array  of  media  and  technologies  that  proliferated  in  the  postmodern  society,  this  cultural 

development  resulted  in  an  intense  reproduction  of  the  favela  image  and  in  the  international 

desire  of  consuming  such  representation.  Nevertheless,  the  tendency  to  analyze  this  cultural 

 

4 
 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
evolution with modernist lenses can continue to perpetuate the existing stigmas and assumptions 

of favela residents, reinforcing the same favela’s image.  

It  is  impossible  to  deny  the  fact  that  the  representation  of  favelas  has  been  changing  through 

history  reaching  the  current  status  of  being  trendy.  Nevertheless,  as  was  shown,  this  process 

was  triggered  by  external  forces  like  media,  art  and  several  businesses  that  associate  their 

image with favelas. At this moment, tourism is also a global force that can contribute to a change 

in the representation of favelas and its people.  

In  contrast,  those  who  are  in  opposition  point  out  that  the  inhabitants  of  these  communities, 

compared with other actors, have an uneven access to the benefits generated by tourism. Plus 

they highlight the fact that the motivation to undertake this kind of experience is only related with 

voyeuristic  consumption  of  poverty.  This  point  of  view  is  stated  by  Mowforth  and  Munt  (2003), 

who argue that visits to poor areas are motivated by a desire to consume real poverty leading to 

the commoditization and aestheticization of poverty that can, in fact, disempower the community.  

The clash of views that surrounds slum tourism is also present in the case of Brazilians favelas 

as is going to be exposed. Concerning the topic of favela tourism, a clearer understanding about 

it is not possible to achieve without first reflecting upon Freire-Medeiros on-going research. This 

scholar is one of the pioneers in studying favelas as a tourism attraction and recently published a 

book in 2009 “Tem Gringo na Lage: Produção, circulação e consumo da favela turística”, which 

means,  Foreigners  on  the  Rooftop:  The  Production,  Circulation  and  Consumption  of  Slum 

Tourism. The book gives a good insight into the complex phenomenon of combining favela and 

tourism. Medeiros helps to demystify this phenomenon and makes a critical analysis of poverty 

and  tourism.  According  to  the  author  (2009),  in  order  to  analyse,  favela  tourism  critically  one 

needs to be free from extreme views. On the one hand, do not believe that tourism in poor areas 

is  the  ideal  solution  for  the  socio  economic  problems  that  a  community  face  and  on  the  other 

hand, do not assume that commodifying poverty for tourism purpose is an immoral activity.  

Medeiros helps us to understand that to be able to claim a position about favela tourism, first you 

need  to  understand  this  phenomenon,  take  into  account  the  specifics  of  each  locality  and 

analyse  how  tourism  is  being  promoted.  However,  such  reflectivity  is  not  evident.  Freire-

Medeiros states that there are many extreme critiques, generalizations and assumptions around 

the  controversial  practice  of  favela  tourism.  The  main  argument  against  it,  highlights 

dehumanization of the poor and voyeurism. Plus analogies with safaris are also frequent in order 

to  illustrate  how  poor  are  exposed  for  tourists’  pleasure.  Furthermore,  it  has  been  claimed  that 

the encounter between favela dwellers and tourists is based on asymmetric interaction. If favela 

dwellers accept  tourists it  is  because  they  are  not aware  of  the humiliation  that  is  taking  place. 

According to this view the contact zones created by this form of tourism are a form of humiliation 

and exploitation of the visited people.

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
Additionally,  there  are  others  who  share  the  opinion  that  it  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Brazilian 

elite,  such  as  researchers,  to  protect  the  favela  dwellers  from  the  immoral  and  voyeuristic  first 

world  eyes.  This  point  of  view  is  shared  by  intellectuals,  researchers  and  the  Brazilian  middle 

class.  However,  in  those arguments  we  can find  two  assumptions:  first  the favela dwellers and 
tourists  are  two  homogeneous  groups  and  the  favelados1  are  not  capable  of  having  critical 

thinking or of being aware of the reality that surrounds them. Freire-Medeiros goes a step further 

in her criticism and dares to state that those who share this opinion want to be blind; avoiding the 

assumption  that  Brazilian  society  has  a  responsibility  in  the  production  of  stereotypes  about 

favelas.  

In opposition to this extremely negative view, the author points out that favela tourism does not 

exclusively  mean  exploiting  the  poor.  It  can  also  have  a  positive  effect  on  the  community  and 

particularly at a social level. Based on her empirical findings in Rocinha (the most touristic favela 

in Rio) she  claims  that  the  community  mentioned  the  chance of  reverting  the  social image  that 

depreciates  favelas  as  the  most  positive  feature  of  having  tourism.  This  evidence  reveals  that 

favela  tourism  can  have  a  beneficial  social  impact  on  the  communities.  Furthermore,  Medeiros 

highlights  the  rescue  of  the  community’s  self-esteem  an  extremely  important  element  while 

analysing  the  role  of  tourism.  Following  this  line,  the  researcher  exposes  the  fact  that  some 

community members are proud of having tourists willing to visit their neighbourhood. 

Based  on  the  author’s  fieldwork  experience,  the  social  dimension  of  favela  tourism  is  also 

present in the mind of some tourism agency owners who claim being aware of the social impact 

of  their  activities  and  believe  that  their  tour  helps  to  improve  the  reputation  of  the  favela.  The 

reproduction  of  the  social  image of  the favela  strongly  affects  the  self-image  of  the community; 

therefore,  tourism  in  poor  areas  can  represent  a  possible  solution  of  raising  the  self-esteem  of 

the local community.  

Highlighting  what  Freire-Medeiros  already  stated,  the  social  dimension  is  a  key  element  when 

analyzing favela tourism. Within the social umbrella the increase of self-esteem and the positive 

repercussion on the community self-image are two important factors when mentioning the role of 

favela tourism.

2.3 Slum Tourism - the Case of Brazilian Favelas 

 

An in-depth understanding of this thesis cannot be achieved without becoming familiar with the 

academic debate that surrounds the selected topic. Therefore, this section will start with a brief 

description  of  what  slum  tourism  is  and  the  main  arguments  against  and  in  favor  of  this  trend. 

This  general  view  will  be  followed  by  a  more  detailed  discussion  concerning  Brazilian  favelas 

since they are the object of study. This new form of tourism, known as slum tourism, consists of 

turning  third World  neighborhoods  and  their  inhabitants  into a  new  commodity  to  be  consumed 

by the North. In this process the “periphery” is incorporated in the global tourism industry as an 

exotic other (Cejas, 2006) It’s currently present in several countries like: India, South Africa and 

Brazil.  

According to Freire- Medeiros (2009) the reason why this new form of tourism is so controversial 

is  because  the  combination  between  leisure  and  poverty  touches  on  the  sensitivity  and  moral 

values of  public opinion. In western morality, leisure and poverty are often seen as two opposite 

concepts and connecting them is considered incoherent and inappropriate. Due to its nature, this 

topic  raises  many  questions  and  ethical  dilemmas.  In  the  heated  debates  about  it  we  can  find 

different positions.  

As proponents of slum tourism, we can mention Scheyvens (2001) who defends the idea that not 

including poor areas like slums in the tourist circuit of a city is reinforcing the social and economic 

isolation  of  such  areas.  Furthermore,  “if  a  more  integrated  society  and  economy  is  the  aim, 

tourism  must  be  promoted  within  formerly  excluded  areas”  (Goudie  et  all  1999  in  Scheyvens, 

2001)  In  general,  those  who  defend  slum  tourism  use  economic  development;  improvement  of 

the  community’s  self-esteem  and  the  enhancement  of  the  tourist’s  awareness  as  their  core 

arguments.  

In  the  intense  debates  around  favela  tourism,  we  can  see  the  danger  of  assuming  that 

communities, especially marginalized groups, are passive recipients with no ability to take control 

over their lives and that favelas are homogeneous places. In reality, favelas are areas with plural 

realities. In fact, according to Valladares book  (2005) “A Invenção da Favela do Mito de Origem 

a  Favela.Com”  favelas  are  heterogenic  neighbourhoods.  Each  one  has  a  different  level  of 

violence,  infra  structures,  educational  skills,  entrepreneurship  and  its  own  level  of  evolvement 

with the Government. However, such evidence is often neglected. The author claims that the last 

thirty  years  of  research  in  the  social  science field  contributed  to  the  association  of  favelas  with 

very simplified features. The general consensus about it spread to policies, government actions 

and  public  opinion.  Those  features  became  “unquestionably  true”  originating  in  the  following 

three  dogmas:  first  the  specifics  of  the  favela.  Due  to  their  history  favelas  are  always  seen  as 

very specific and unique places. Places with their own rules, structure and apart from the rest of 

7

the  city.  Secondly  there  is  the  social  image  related  to  its  dwellers.  Favelas  are  considered 

exclusively  the  home  of  the  poor.  Finally,  Favelas  are  constantly  being  portrayed  as  a 

homogeneous  territory,  although  they  possess  a  quite  plural  reality  internally  and  also  in 

comparison with others, there is a great tendency to see them as a singular place.  

Defending Freire- Medeiros critique of how discussions about favela tourism are being shaped, 

one  may  claim  that  this  topic  is  being  gazed  at  a  very  polarized  view.  Probably,  the  challenge 

concerning  this  subject  is  the  fact  that  it  is  a  very  recent  and  complex  phenomenon  with  little 

academic research carried out. The deficiency of academic attention can justify why there are so 

many  common  sense  assumptions  and  judgments  around  it.  It  is  fundamental  to  enrich  the 

debates about favela tourism with more academic reflections. Therefore, the role of my research 

is  to  bring  some  clarification  about  favela  tourism  and  demystify  some  of  the  assumptions  that 

have been made about it. 

  

2.4 Exploring the Other Side of Favela Tourism 

 

Having  in  mind  what  Freire-  Medeiros  suggests  this  study  intends  to  take  into  account  the 

context of each favela and how tourism is being developed in each case. It aims to understand 

how  this  phenomenon  is  interpreted  and  what  it  represents  for  the  communities.  This  research 

desires  to  go  a  step  further  from  the  above  polarized  views  and  reveal  another  perspective  of 

favela  tourism  based  on  an  inner  view  of  two  communities.  It  seeks  to  emphasize  the  positive 

side  of  combining  poverty  and  tourism,  therefore  it  will  explore  the  social  dimension  of  favela 

tourism taking into account the community perspective.  

As  Medeiros  mentioned,  the  increase  of  the  community’s  self-esteem  can  be  one  of  the  best 

contributions of linking tourism and vulnerable areas.  Taking a more in-depth  analysis into  the 

potential  of  favela  tourism,    self-esteem  can  be  a  starting  point  for  discussing  the  possibility  of 

social  transformation.  In fact,  the  positive  contribution  of  tourism  within favelados  can  lead  to a 

reflection upon the power of tourism in creating a social transformation. It can be an opportunity 

to reduce the social and geographical gaps that exist between slums and other areas, promoting 

what Scheyvens (2001) refers a more integrated city. It can be the chance for residents to look at 

themselves and their place in a different way, celebrating what they have best. Besides, it can be 

the  possibility  to  broaden  their  horizons,  gain  new  skills,  absorb  new  knowledge  and  possibly 

aspire to a different lifestyle   (Smith & Robinson, 2006).  

Following  this  line  of  thought,  social  transformation  through  tourism  can  open  a  space  for 

improving the social representation of the slum dwellers. If it is possible to promote dialogue and 

an understanding in tourist encounters, it is likely that tourism can contribute to a new insight into 

 

8 
 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
favela dwellers. For a better understanding, the example of township tourism in South Africa will 

be mentioned in order to illustrate the positive impact of tourism. According to Regina Scheyvens 

(2001),  township  tours  help  to  smooth  stereotypes  and  show  to  visitors  that  they  and  slum 

dwellers  share  middle  class  norms  and  values,  such  as  carrying  for  the  wellbeing  of    their 

families.  A  local  community  that  believes  in  their  abilities  and  demonstrates  pride  in  their 

traditions  and  culture  can  be  seen  as  psychologically  powerful  (Mansperger,  1992).  Tourism 

initiatives  which  focus  is  to  promote  intercultural  understanding  can  contribute  to  empowering 

communities.  Psychological  empowerment  comes  from  self-esteem  and  pride  in  cultural 

traditions (Smith & Robinson, 2006).  

The contribution of tourism represented by the townships case will be sought in favela tourism. In 

the sphere of physiological wellbeing it is evident that self-esteem is an important concept and is 

often mentioned by scholars to expose the intangible benefits of tourism in local communities. As 

a result, in this study this concept will be the main guidance while evoking the positive effects of 

tourism.  For  a  better  understanding,  self-esteem  can  be  a  definition  of  how  people  evaluate 

themselves. 

Its  synonyms  embrace  self-worth,  self-regard,  self-confidence,  and  pride 

(Baumeister, 2005).    

Having  self-esteem  as  the  starting  point,  the  social  dimension  of  favela  tourism  can  reach  a 

higher level of complexity. It can encourage an internal transformation that can open a path for a 

shift in the representation of slum residents.  

As well as the social impact, when referring to the relationship between tourism development and 

communities  a  common  concept  in  the  tourism  literature  is  participation.  It  has  been  seen  by 

different scholars as the key element to reduce the negative aspects and maximize the positive 

contribution  of  tourism  projects.  This  vision  is  supported  by  Toscun  (2005)  who  states  that 

participation is a means of creating opportunities for the community to take tourism development 

into  their  hands  by  using  their  potential  resources  and  having  more  information  about  tourism 

developments.  In  a  general  way,  the  concept  of  local  participation  embraces  the  idea  of 

communities  being  more  involved  in  the  decision  making  process  and  being  able  to  gain  more 

control over the development and benefits of tourism (León, 2006).  

Furthermore,  according  to  Mowforth  and  Munt  (2003)  the  only  forms  of  local  participation  that 

can break existing patterns of power and unequal access of tourism development are the ones 

originated  within  the  community  itself.  Nevertheless,  it  is  important  to  keep  in  mind  that  in  the 

context  of  developing  countries 

the  relationship  between  community  participation  and 

development is not always proportional. The constraint that those countries and excluded areas 

face can justify this reality (Toscun, 2005).  

In the favela tourism context the concept of local participation being addressed is important   for 

two  reasons.  First  to  clarify  the  assumption  that  residents  are  simple  commodities  for  western 

9 
 

 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
voyeuristic consumption. Second, in order to explore the social potential of tourism in favelas it is 

crucial  to  understand  if  its  development  is  matching  local  needs  and  if  it  is  potentializing  the 

chance of locals to gaining mastery over their own lives.  

Still in the same line of embracing the social contribution of favela tourism, the empowerment of 

minorities and marginalized groups can be essential for their adjustment  into society (Deloria & 

Lytle,  1883).  As  Onyx  and  Benton  (1995)  claim  in  the  discourse  of  community  development 

empowerment  is  connected  with  concepts  of  participation,  self-help,  networking  and  equity. 

Besides, they believe that participation is a vital part of empowerment since taking a role in the 

decision making process improves the self-esteem, confidence, knowledge and skills.  

As Rapport (1984) points out empowerment is a difficult concept to operationalize and no single 

measure  can  define  it  properly.  This  study  does  not  aim  to  go  into  analysing  this  concept  in 

depth.  It  is  only  presented  to  reinforce  the  importance  of  incorporating  the  concept  of 

participation  in  this  research.  Furthermore  it  helps  to  illustrate  the  possible  positive  effects  of 

tourism  in  disadvantaged  areas.  Empowerment  can  be  seen  as  part  of  the  process  of  allowing 

vulnerable communities to participate in tourism development.  

It  is  possible  to  acknowledge  that  local  participation  can  indeed  have  a  positive  impact  in  the 

community and be a link to the social dimension that tourism developments in vulnerable areas 

can  achieve.  Since  this  study  aims  to  explore  the  possibility  of  social  transformation  through 

tourism,  participation  is  an  essential  element  and  can  be  an  important  vehicle  to  reach  such  a 

goal.  Therefore it will be an important issue to be addressed in this research. 

In conclusion, it is clear that the social magnitude of favela tourism can be intimately connected 

to local participation. Both concepts can open a path for more philosophical conversations about 

the role of tourism and its contribution to society. Following this line of thought, the new emerging 

paradigm known as transmodernity seems the most appropriate theoretical umbrella to embrace 

the  mission  of  this  study.  Within  this  philosophical  concept  tourism  gains  an  innovative  image, 

plus  it  is  possible  to  discuss  its  contribution  to  achieve  higher  values.  The  role  of  tourism  in 

vulnerable  areas  can  be  revaluated  and  favelas  as  an  object  of  study  become  detached  from 

existing stereotypes, gaining a new complexity.  

In  order  to  clarify  its  relevance  for  conducting  this  research  a  more  detailed  explanation  about 

this  theory  will  be  presented,  followed  by  a  discussion  concerning  its  connection  with  the 

selected topic.

2.5 Transmodernity  

 

Transmodernity  was  for  the  first  time  presented  by  the  Spanish  philosopher  Rosa  Maria 

Rodrigues in her  paper  “ La  Sonrisa de Saturno.  Hacia  una  teoria  transmoderna”  in  1989. She 

claims that transmodernity represents a development of thought that seeks to embrace the best 

of the traditional, modern and postmodern reality. Transmodernity is the concept that represents 

and  explains  emerging  shifts  at  a  socio-  cultural,  political,  economic  and  philosophic  level.  To 

sum  up,  it  defines  a  global  mind  change  (Ateljevic,  2009)  .  There  are  several  scholars, 

intellectuals and researchers that share the same vision and point out evidence in different fields. 

It is possible to say that transmodernity is the result of the current time that we are living in. We 

are in a transitional period, a time where human thinking is shifting from postmodern to what is 

now known as a transmodern way of thinking (Luijckx, 1999). 

From  a  more  sociological  and  political-economic  vision, Dr.  Marc Ghisi  (2001)  defends  that  we 

are  moving  away  from  controlling  the  world  through  reason  and  reaching  a  stage  where  every 

woman, man, culture and worldview, based on equality, is pushed towards the center.   A joined 

effort for rejecting values of control, domination and to fight for a better future. Transmodernity, 

goes  against  the  ongoing  desire  for  economic  development  and  material  wealth  and  instead, 

measures progress by using quality of life as a barometer.  

Worldviews have been shaped throughout time resulting in the emerging transmodern mindset. 

Each era is dominated by its own “Truth” and values that shape human behaviour and society. 

Reality  is  perceived  differently  according  to  each  period:  Premodern,  Modern,  Postmodern  and 

Transmodern.  

In a general way, in the Modern period human thinking was dominated by rationality. Truth was 

what could be proved by scientific methods. In this period society structures were based on the 

concept  of  deconstruction,  which  led  to  the  separation  of  the  serious-rational-masculine-

economic-scientific pole and the religion-intuition-aesthetic-feminine pole (Luijckx, 1999).  

In  the  following  paradigm,  known  as  postmodern,  society  is  disenchanted  by  rational  thinking. 

Skepticism  rules  and  reflects  the  disbelief,  the  inexistence  of  Truth.  Individuals  are  becoming 

aware  of  the  limitations  of  what  was  once  the  rational  way  of  organizing  society.  As  a  result  a 

transmodern  way  of  thinking  is  emerging.  It  embraces  rationality  and  intuitive  thinking  without 

divisions.  Tolerance  and  positive  thoughts  dominate.  Diversity  is  celebrated.  No  one  owns  the 

Truth.  There is  an  active  tolerance. Women  rejoin society. Women  and men  are  equal  citizens 

with the power of deciding upon their common future (Luyckx, 1999).  

 

11 
 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
In sum, the idea of transmodern means that the best of modernity should be preserved without 

compromising  the  need  to  go  beyond. The  world  no  longer  needs  to  be  gazed  as  an  objective 

reality  with  one  Truth.  After  the  deconstruction  that  dominated  the  previous  paradigm,  a 

reconstruction vision can now start. It rejects religious divisions and dogmas while rediscovering 

the sacred as a dimension of life (L. M.  Ghisi, 2006). 

After  exposing  the  complexity  of  the  selected  paradigm,  one  may  question how  transmodernity 

can contribute to the tourism industry. The answer to this enquiry is precisely what is going to be 

revealed in the next section.  

 

2.6 Transmodernity in Tourism 

 

Transmodernity  can  be  connected  to  tourism  in  different  ways.  The  most  common  one  is  to 

associate the changes in the market, for instance the rise of spiritual and educational trips, as a 

reflection  of  the  travel  preferences  of  those  individuals  that  have  adopted  their  lifestyles 

according to their worldviews. Following this line, tourism can be seen as a key indicator to the 

global change in human consciousness. In this way, the role of tourism can be raised to a higher 

level and finally be seen as “a serious field of study” (Airey, 2007; Ateljevic, 2009; Nash, 2007). It 

will be possible then to change public opinion about their dominant and shallow view of tourism 

as  just  a  leisure  activity  or  another  tool  to  reach  economic  development  (Ateljevic,  2009).  The 

same author, provides a good example of how can we reconstruct the role of tourism by referring 

to  Theodore  Zeldin,  an  Oxford  historian  and  a  public  intellectual.  In  his  vision  tourism  can 

contribute  to  a  better  human  dialogue  at  an  international  level.  As  a  result,  he  conceived  the 

Oxford Muse Foundation that aims to rethink a new model for different business. In the case of 

hotels,  he  came  up  with  the  concept  of  Muse  Hotels  where  besides  the  regular  services;  it 

enlarges  the  guest  experiences  by  transforming  hotels  into  types  of  cultural  centers  (http:// 

www.oxfordmuse.com/projects/projects.htm).  

Tourism  embraces  within  the  transmodern  umbrella  a  higher  stage  of  contribution  to  society.  It 

can become a platform to potential social change and human conscience. Transmodernity opens 

the path to look at positive benefits driven by tourism and its input to human interconnectedness 

(Ateljevic, 2009).  

In  conclusion,  it  is  clear  that  transmodernity  has  its  impacts  on  tourism.  Transmodern  lenses 

gives  to  this  industry  the  chance  to  reconstruct  its  image.  From  a  frivolous  activity  or  mainly   

business 

to  an 

international 

indicator  of  one  of 

the  most  relevant  shifts 

in  human    

consciousness.  Tourism  gains  a  new  dimension  and  importance  and  it  is  able  to  contribute  to 

higher  causes  such  as  improvement  of  understanding  and  connection  among  human  beings. 

Despite the insight of how this philosophical concept can be attached to tourism, concerning the 
12 
 

 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
selected  topic  such  link  is  not  yet  visible.  A  better  understanding  of  the  association  of  favela 

tourism and transmodernity can be achieved in the following section.  

 

2.7 Favela Tourism From a Transmodern Perspective 

 

Contemporary tourism is frequently associated to the “otherness machine”. Tourism destinations 

are  presented  as  sites  and  the  people  within  as  sights  for  tourists.  The  people  are  usually 

portrayed within this frame as passive agents. In this process places and people are presented 

as, exotic as the other. This vision neglects the fact that those places are constantly in motions of 

change and its people are evolving due to contact with tourists and the consumer opportunities 

that  tourism  as  a  source  of  livelihood  provides  (Aitchison,  2001).  Similarities  can  be  found  in 

regard  to  favela  tourism.  Favelas  and  their  peoples  are  portrayed  as  exotic  object  for  western 

pleasure.  Frequently  the  “speaking  subject”  is  the  western  tour  operator  or  tourists  and  the 

“center of talk” is the residents. Critical voices claim that favela tourism is a form of exploitation of 

the  weakest  ones.  Plus,  it  points  out  that  those  locals  cannot  protect  themselves  from  being 

exposed, reinforcing the vision that slum dwellers are passive victims.  

Embracing  the  topic  of  favela  tourism  with  transmodern  lenses  gives  me  the  freedom  as  a 

researcher  to  take  a  step  back  from  this  frame  and  gaze  at  a  different  angle.  It  allows 

acknowledging  that  reality  is  constantly  changing  and  therefore  favelas  are  also  permanently 

evolving.  They  possess  a  hybrid  environment  and  their  own  dynamics.  Furthermore,  because 

transmodern  vision  has  positive  thinking  as  one  of  the  main  pillars  it  allows  move  away  from 

pessimistic  views  and  the  opportunity  to  visualize  positive  outcomes  of  favela  tourism.  Being 

inspired  by  Margaret  Silf  who  claims  that”  to  travel  is  to  discover  that  human  beings  in  other 

lands and cultures are also people with whom we can share our laughter and our tears, and that 

what  we  have  in  common  is  a  great  deal more  than  the  sum  of  all  our  differences.”  (Margaret, 

2006, p. 178), allows reflection upon its input on global awareness. Favela tourism can give an 

opportunity to gain an inner perspective and bring people together. It can be a starting point for 

creating a bridge to reduce the gap between favelas and the rest of the city. It can be an open 

door  for  dialogue  and  understanding.  Transmodernity  does  not  erase  the  fact  that  favelas  are 

indeed  paradoxical  it  does  not  neglect  the  fact  that  tourism  can  be  responsible  for  increasing 

powerless  and  exploitation.  It  acknowledges  those  facts  but  provides  a  chance  to  discuss  new 

possibilities  such  as  the  contribution  to  a  change  in  human  consciousness  and  social 

transformation.  

Keeping in mind Freire-Medeiros suggestion of avoiding the dominant view, transmodern thinking 

provides the theoretical argument to move away from the hegemonic assumptions and polarized 

 

13 
 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
views.  It  allows  embracing  favela  tourism  having  in  mind  the  importance  of  the  specific 

environment and the context of each case.   

In  the  beginning  of  the  theoretical  chapter  it  was  clear  that  the  distinctions  made  by  public 

opinion and governments concerning favelas as “us and the rest” resulted in a strong social and 

geographic  separation.  The  transmodern  view  can  interpret  favela  tourism  as  an  opportunity  to 

challenge  existing  divisions  by  creating  a  space  where  “we”  can  co-exist.  Where  diversity  is 

celebrated  and  dialogue  is  in  pursuit.  The  analysis  of  contact  zones  can  be  a  good  way  to 

understand  how  the  clash  of  cultures  and  existing  barriers  can  be  dealt  with.  For  a  better 

understanding  of  the  meaning  of  the  “contact  zones”,  Louise  Pratt  defined  it  as  “social  spaces 

where  cultures  meet,  clash  and  grapple  with  each  other  in  contexts  of  highly  asymmetric 

relations of power” (Pratt, 1999, p. 76). 

In  conclusion,  as  the  final  outcome,  from  a  transmodern  view  this  study  intends  to  explore  the 

role of tourism in opening a path for a possible positive change in the representation of favelas 

and its people. Consequently it will improve more understanding about favela tourism and reduce 

the extreme views that dominate the literature about it.  

For a better understanding of how this research is connected to transmodernity, it is relevant to 

make it clear that the aim of this study is not to actually prove or measure at an empirical level 

the existence of the selected theory. That explains why it was presented in a general way rather 

than in a detailed explanation. In this context, transmodernity should be seen as the theoretical 

backup that permits me as a researcher to explore the social dimension of favela tourism, a less 

known  side.  It  is  the  perfect  umbrella  to  bring  into  discussion  the  role  of  tourism  in  poor  areas 

and to embrace its potential as a trigger to initiate a social transformation that can open a way for 

a  change  in  the  human  mindset.  Furthermore,  as  was  previously  revealed  this  approach  to 

transmodernity is in harmony with Freire-Medeiros main argument.  

Since  transmodernity  is  quite  a  philosophical  paradigm  in  order  to  conduct  fieldwork  it  will  be 

operationalized  into  the  following  concepts:  self-esteem,  local  participation,  dialogue  and 

aspirations. Each dimension will be evaluated in each case study and the positive contribution of 

tourism  will  be  discussed  based  on  the evidences that  each  context  highlights.  The  features  of 

tourism development in each case study will allow discussing if favela tourism has the potential 

to be seen as a transformative form of tourism.  

Due  to  the  fact  that  this  study  will  be  focus  exclusively  on  the  community  side,  it  will  give  a 

chance for the “speaking subject” to be finally the center of the discussion.

3.1 Introduction 

The  aim  of  this  research  is  to  contribute  to  a  better  understanding  of  the  phenomenon  favela 

tourism and to explore the social dimension of this activity based on the community perspective. 

In  this  chapter  information  will  be  given  concerning  the  methodology  applied  at  a  theoretical 

level.  More  precisely:  the  research  strategy,  data  analysis  and  data  collection  methods.  In 

advance, it will provide a detailed description of the fieldwork experience.  

 

3.2 Research in the Social Science Field  

 

In social science research one must select a paradigm that will guide its whole research process.  

For  a  better understanding  one  can  define  paradigm  as  a  basic  set  of  beliefs  that  guide  action 

(Guba,  1990).  For  this  study  the  paradigm  adopted  was  the  interpretative  social  science 

paradigm.  It  is  based  on  the  work  of  Max  Weber  and  his  term  “verstehen”  or  empathetic 

understanding.  According  to  the  author,  “verstehen”  is  obtained  when  “trough  sympathetic 

participation one can grasp the emotional context in which the action takes place”  (Weber, 1978, 

p. 5).  

This  paradigm  defends  that  there  are  multiple  realities  to  explain  a  phenomenon,  the  research 

process  should  be  subjective  rather  than  objective  and  preference  is  given  to  qualitative 

methodological approach.  Plus, data should be collected based on the insider’s view and in their 

natural  environment  (Jennings,  2001).  Once  a  brief  description  of  the  paradigm  is  made,  it 

becomes clear, taking into account the nature of this study that this choice is in harmony with the 

topic, data analysis and aim of this research.  

 

3.3 Research Techniques 

 

In  the  condition  of  a  qualitative  researcher  one  has  a  great  variety  of  methods  and  practices 

available in order  to  address  the  research  questions  that define  the path of  the  study  (Jamal & 

Hollinshead,  2001).  In  this  research  the  case  study  method  was  selected  plus  other  two 

techniques  named  as:  semi  structure  interviews  and  participant  observation.    Once  the 

techniques  have  been  chosen  the  next  step  is  to  guarantee  the  reliability  and  validity  of  the 

research.  In  this  case  the  triangulation  method  was  adopted  in  order  to  increase  the 

trustworthiness  of  this  study.  According  to  Jennings  (2001)  triangulation  involves  using  several 

 

15

methods  to  gather  relevant  data.  At  a  methodological  level  there  are  different  sources  of 

triangulation  but  for  the  purpose  of  this  study,  triangulation  of  methods  was  the  most  suitable 

option.  In  this  sense,  the  data  gathered  from  the  different  techniques  were  merged  in  order  to 

gain a deeper understanding and to eliminate possible errors of misleading information.

The  research  strategy  adopted  for  this  thesis  is  the  case  study.    According  to  Yin  (1994)  case 

study  can  be  interpreted as  an empirical inquiry  that  investigates  a  contemporary  phenomenon 

within its real life context (Jennings, 2001).  In order to conduct this research an exploratory case 

study was selected, which means that this research explores a tourism phenomenon to discover 

its uniqueness or characteristics since no pre-existing data exists in the public arena (Yin, 1994). 

Since  the  nature  of  this  study  was  to  investigate  the  uniqueness  of  each  context  which  lacks 

scientific  knowledge,  especially  in  relation  to  one  of  the  case  studies  (Pereira  da  Silva)  the 

exploratory case study was the most suitable choice.       

               

3.4.1 Selection Process of Case Studies 

 

During the process of collecting information about the selected topic for my thesis I came across 

the fact that there was a lack of scientific information regarding tourism development in favelas. 

Therefore, the majority of the articles found presented Rocinha as an object of study. Due to this 

fact  I  also  decided  to  include  Rocinha  as  part  of  my  research.  In  this  way,  I  could  more  easily 

understand  the  phenomenon  and  what  kind  of  tourism  scenario  I  could  find  in  my  fieldwork. 

Since the topic, the city and particularly the favelas were unknown to me the selection of Rocinha 

was  very  important  because  it  gave  me  a  more  detailed  vision  of  what  kind  of  tourism 

development I was going to face, what organizations I could find there and some initial contacts 

that later on were beneficial for my fieldwork.  Besides, the fact that it was the pioneer favela to 

receive  tourists  and  is  the  most  touristic  one,  contributed  to  reinforce  the  value  of  including 

Rocinha as a case study.  

The option of including another favela seemed like a wise option once I had clearer vision of the 

aim  of  my  study.  I  decided  to  explore  two  case  studies  with  opposite  development  nature:  one 

locally initiated and another controlled by external actors. Since the objective was to understand 

the social dimension of favela tourism and its possible contribution for a social transformation, I 

assumed that the crucial difference among the case studies could contribute to valuable data in 

my findings. The main reason why particularly Pereira da Silva was chosen is based on the fact 

 

16 
 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
that  first  of  all  it  is  a  local  initiative  and  then  because  it  offers  very  unique  tourism  activities. 

Pereira  da Silva  was  the  first  favela  to  offer accommodation  and  is  the only  one  that  gives  the 

visitors  an  opportunity  to  see  an  art  project  made  by  locals  that  has  been  participating  in 

international renowned exhibitions and museums.     

Due to its particularity Pereira da Silva personally attracted my curiosity. At a scientific level this 

favela  seemed  like  the  perfect  case  study  to  show  a  positive  example  of  an  active  community. 

Furthermore,  the  objective  of  clarifying  some  of  the  assumptions  regarding  the  topic  reinforced 

my choice for Pereira since it challenges the idea that slum dwellers are lazy and lack initiative.  

   

3.5 Data Collection Methods 

 

During fieldwork the techniques used were semi structure interviews and participant observation. 

The  first  one  can  be  defined  as  pseudo  conversations  that  usually  have  set  rules  to  follow 

(Jennings, 2001).  In this case since the interviews were regarding topics such as participation, 

benefits,  perceptions  and  aspirations  it  seemed  like  the  wisest  option  to  collect  data. 

Nevertheless,  it  is  important  to  highlight  that  the  questions  were  open  and  was  similar  to  a 

conversation  which  contributed  to  making  the  interviewee  more  comfortable  and  willing  to 

collaborate.  

In  relation  to  the  semi  structure  interview  design,  the  only  target    were  locals  but  due  to  the 

nature of the research two semi structure interviews were elaborated. One of them was directed 

to locals connected to tourism, which means residents related with the tourism activities or those 

that  could  directly  benefit  from  tourism  were  part  of  this  group.  The  other  one  was  directed  to 

residents  whose livelihood  was  not  connected  at  all  with  tourism.  The  objective  was  to  verify  if 

the general community perception to tourism was homogenous and avoid being influenced by a 

possible more favorable opinion of those that rely on tourism. Curiously, in both favelas the two 

groups shared quite a similar vision of tourism. In total, in a period of three months twenty one 

interviews were conducted. More precisely, nine interviews in Pereira and ten in Rocinha.  

The profile of the interviewees was quite diverse in both favelas. In general the average age was 

in  between  thirty  to  forty,  the  youngest  being  nineteen  and  the  oldest  seventy  years  old.  Since 

the idea was to get an insight into how locals perceive tourism I decided that it would be more 

beneficial to get an overview across different ages instead of selecting a more specific group.  

In  respect  to  gender,  the  sample  collected  is  far  less  homogeneous  compared  to  age  factor. 

There is a predominance of females in the sample of Pereira da Silva. The motive that can justify 

this is related to the fact that a day care centre for children or any kind of assistance is basically 

nonexistent.  Therefore  once  women  have  a  child  they  tend  to  stay  in  home  to  take  care  of  it. 
17 
 

 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
Furthermore, the fact that the birth rate is high in favelas (especially among youth) reinforces the 

probability of interacting more with the female gender. 

In terms of sample selection, since I started fieldwork first in Pereira da Silva those that were part 

of  my  routine  as  volunteer  were  the  primary  source,  such  as  the  mothers  of  the  children  that 

attended Morrinho activities.  Later, the selection started based on snow ball effect, meaning that 

each interviewee  would  suggest  someone  that  could  be  relevant.  Others  were  obvious  choices 

since they were connected to organizations that I wanted to approach.  Besides semi structure 

interviews  and  participant  observation  was  also  an  adopted  technique.  According  to  Patton 

(1990) participant observation requires intensive fieldwork in which the researcher is immerged in 

the culture of the object of study (in Jennings, 2001). In this way, during the three months spent 

in  both  favelas  observations  were  conducted  constantly  and  organized  into  a  reflection  note 

book.  

To complement the data collected by the above methods, less “formal” sources were used which 

highly  contributed  to  my  integration,  interaction  with  slum  dwellers  and  understanding  how 

favelas  are  approached  as  a  tourism  destination.  Due  to  the  nature  of  the  selected  object  of 

study one of my main concerns was how to get access to a favela and to what extend it would be 

possible  for  me  to  conduct  my  fieldwork.  In  order  to  facilitate  my  presence  and  to  more  easily 

gain  the  confidence  of  the  residents  I  decided  to  conduct  volunteer  work  for  a  period  of  two 

months in  the NGO  Morrinho in  Pereira  da Silva.  In  relation  to  Rocinha  the same strategy  was 

not applied because it would have been extremely difficult to conduct two  volunteer jobs at the 

same time plus the research.  

Therefore,  taking  into  account  the  fact  that  Rocinha  is  quite  touristy  and  external  and  internal 

actors work independently, I decided to participate in two tour experiences. One was organized 

by  an  external  tourism  agency,  named Favela Tour,  which  owner is  Marcello  Armstrong, who I 

had  been  in  contact  with  since  the  beginning  of  my  research  and  who  had  always  been  very 

helpful to me. The second one was a tour run by a local guide. The idea behind participating in 

two  opposite  forms  of  tours  was  to  understand  the  differences  and  similarities  according  to  the 

methods,  group  size,  guide  performance,  visited  areas  and  overall  approach  to  the  favela  as  a 

tourism commodity. For a better understanding of what each tour can offer to their tourists, one 

can find below a brief summary of each experience.

3.5.1 Marcelo Armstrong tour: 

 

On  February  9th,  I  participated  in  the  Marcelo  Armstrong  tour.    The  group  size  was  relatively 

small,  ten  people  attended.  It  had  duration  of  3  hours  and  it  was  carried  out  by  traveling  in  a 

small  van  and  also  on  foot  in  the  main  streets.  It  included  visiting  Rocinha  and  Vila  Canoas  a 

small  favela,  closed  by.  There,  we  visited  the  social  project  Para  ti,  which  this  tour  agency 

financially  supports.  After  attending  this  tour  I  must  say  that  I  gained  a  good  impression  about 

this agency and mostly because of the guide’s role. During the 3 hours tour she constantly tried 

to  make  the  tourists  understand  that  the  way  media  describes  favela  residents  does  not  really 

correspond  to  reality  because  only  a  small  percentage,  some  say  1%,  are  actually  involved  in 

trafficking.  The  rest  are  just  hard  working  people.  She  also  highlighted  to  the  group  that  many 

staff members of  their  luxury  hotels  also  live  in favelas.   Her discourse  was mainly  focused on 

Rio’s extreme social inequality, the lack of public policies for the poor and the low quality of the 

public school system and health system, the only services that poor people can attend.  

In addition, the guide was very open to discussing a popular assumption that remains open, the 

possibility  of  tourism  agencies  being  associated  with  trafficing  in  order  to  guarantee  tourists 

security. She made it clear that there is no connection between them and the agencies operating 

there. According to her, the drug lords want to keep Rocinha in low profile in order to avoid police 

attention. Therefore, committing any source of crime to a tourist would cause the opposite effect. 

In  addition,  she  argues  that  it  is  an  advantage  for  them  to  have  tourists  because  it  passes  the 

message to the middle and upper classes that it is safe to enter Rocinha. Therefore there is no 

reason for them to interfere with the tourists’ safety. Furthermore, the guide explained that once 

we were there the watchers (those that stay in strategic points watching if police or the rival gang 

is coming) knew about our presence and communicated to the rest of the group so they would 

circulate more discretely.  

The tour started in Rocinha and the main stopping point was in the art craft stalls in one of the 

main  streets,  giving  a  chance  for  tourists  to  purchase  souvenirs.  It  is  important  to  refer  to  this 

moment because one of the most common arguments of locals is that external guides block the 

opportunity of tourists investing their money inside the favela. It is also relevant to mention that 

the  guide  was  very  friendly  to  the  artists,  introducing  each  one  individually  to  the  group. 

According  to  her opinion,  this  small  jest  is  important  because it makes  them feel proud of  their 

work.  

An  important  aspect  of  this  tour  was  the  fact  that  before  starting  and  even  during,  several 

recommendations  were  given  concerning  pictures.  We  were  told  only  to  take  pictures  in  the 

areas  allowed  by  the  guide  and  to  avoid  photographing  people  especially  without  permission. 

Also, other recommendations were given concerning the tourists behavior. We were told to avoid 

 

19 
 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
interfering as much as possible in the residents routine, therefore we were asked to let residents 

pass first while walking in narrow and busy streets. Later I found out that such awareness is not 

always transmitted to the tourists which make some locals claim that tourism is invasive.  

After visiting Rocinha, which is a mix of walking and touring in a small van, the next stop was Vila 

Canoas to visit the social project that the agency supports. The project is an educational center 

to  support  children  and  teenagers  with  their  academic  work  after  school.  After  it,  we  continued 

with a walk through the favela and finalized the tour.  

At  the  end  of  the  tour,  I  had  the  opportunity  to  discuss  the  topic  of  tourism  in  favelas  with  the 

guide.  She  confessed  she  previously  had  a  very  negative  image  of  favelas  and  their  residents 

but  that  had  gradually  changed  once  she  started  working  in  the  field  of  favela  tourism. 

Furthermore, she expressed that the idea that favelas are no go areas is so strong that her family 

never dare to do a tour with her. In addition, she revealed that her family and close friends do not 

agree with her work choice, describing it as risky and bizarre. This informal conversation led me 

to believe what I already suspected about the strong Brazilian prejudice to this form of tourism.  

Finally,  I  want  to  mention  the  fact  that  during  the  tour  there  were  a  Norwegian  couple  that 

complained about not being able to see people carrying guns just like a friend of theirs did while 

taking a Rocinha tour. They expressed their disappointment about only  seeing a normal routine 

and  a  peaceful  environment.  This  episode  made  me  reflect  upon  how  favelas  can  be 

commoditized as an exotic product for the voyeuristic consumption of western adventure tourists 

and how that perpetuates the negative stereotypes and reinforces the power structures inside the 

favela, making  those  related  with  trafficking even more  powerful and  the  rest  of  the  community 

more submissive.  

3.5.2 Zezinho tour  

 

On February 18th I participated in a Zezinho tour. Zezinho is a resident of Rocinha who speaks 

English fluently because he is half American and spent some years living in the United States of 

America. He explained that he first started giving tours in Rocinha in an informal way, by taking 

friends of friends who were traveling in Rio and were curious about the reality of favelas. Later, 

through  the  encouragement  of  a  couple  that  took  his  tour  he  decided  being  a  guide  would 

become  his  full  time  job.  Therefore  he  took  a  short  course  on  tourism  that  an  organization  in 

Rocinha  provides  and  five  months  launched  ago  a  website  to  promote  his  tours:  www. 

favelatour.org.  

A  Zezinho  tour  starts  in  Ipanema  (a  rich  and  quite  well  known  area)  and  from  there  we  took  a 

Kombi (small public vans that circulate around the city) which brought us to the starting point of 

Rocinha. Zezinho explained that his intention was to provide his tourists with as much of a local 

 

20 
 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
experience as possible and to blend in among the crowd. So reaching the favela in the same way 

as any other resident is part of that.  

This  local  guide  only  works  with  small  groups.  On  that  day  we  were  four  in  total,  three  of  us  , 

being  student  researchers  which  made  it  possible  to  put  forward  questions  during  the  tour.  In 

fact,  Zezinho  does  not  have  a  fixed  discourse  and  it  was  possible  to  discuss  the  topics  that 

interested  us most.  Another important detail is  that  there is  no  fixed  time  schedule  so  his  tours 

can  always  last  longer.  In  my  case  I  was  supposed  to  have  a  three  hours  tour  but  ended  up 

spending five hours there.   

On  his  tours  he  intends  to  move  away  from  the  most  common  circuit  in  order  to  show,  in  his 

opinion, taking a tour with a local is a far richer experience because they know the area where 

they live. This way, he showed us the Academicos da Rocinha, the place where they rehearse 

for the carnival and we could see the theme of that year and take pictures. Then we stopped in a 

small café to eat or drink something.  

During  the  tour  Zezinho  and  myself  spoke  about  the  topic  of  favela  tourism  and  he  revealed 

himself to be very critical about how agencies explore Rocinha. He argues that tourists do not get 

to  see  or  sense  what  life  is  in  Rocinha  and  they  do  not  spend  any  money  in  the  community, 

therefore he was very open to let the group spend time at the market or in a restaurant.   

After that, we took a moto taxi, the most common way for residents to move around in Rocinha, 

and went to an area known as Visual (a high point in Rocinha where you can have a wonderful 

view  of  a  great  part  of  the  city  and  the  beaches).  After  that  we  walked  around  the  favela, 

including the narrow alleys.  

During  the  tour  the  topics  covered  ranged  from  renting  houses,  the  role  of  the  Residents 

Association,  what  locals  think about  tourism,  health  issues,  schools,  public  transportation,  local 

economy, drugs security,  among others. Zezinho was quite open to any question all the time. I 

felt that Zezinho gave to the group freedom about what to talk or even what to see or do. The fact 

that  we  were  a  small  group  definitely  helped  in  that  sense.  In  my  case,  besides  being  open  to 

answering  some  specific  questions  he  gave  me  some  tips  about  where  to  find  certain 

organizations that I was looking for.  

His tours usually involve visiting the art studio of tio Lino, not to purchase anything but to see the 

work made  by  children,  but  since  the  person in  charge  was  hospitalized  that  was  not  possible. 

We ended the tour in his house, looking at the beautiful view from his terrace and continued our 

informal conversations.

3.6 Data Analysis Methods 

 

Data  analysis  requires  organizing  what  one  has  seen,  heard  and  read  so  that  one  can  make 

sense  of  what  has  been  learned.  In  order  to  do  so,  it  is  necessary  to  categorize,  synthesize, 

interpret and search for patterns of the data that has been collected (Glesne 1999, in Jennings, 

2001).    In  this  way,  there  are  several  options  concerning  the  way  a  researcher  decides  to 

analyze the data. In  this study, a qualitative content analysis method was chosen for analyzing 

the data gathered.  

In qualitative content analysis the researcher is free to analyze the text without being restrained 

to  a  theory  or  concepts  in  advance.  Hence,  the  researcher  is  open  to  find  out  what  the  text 

reveals and analyze the data taking into account the social context from which they were taken 

(Jennings, 2001).  

In  this  case,  the  data  analysis  was  conducted  based  on  interview  transcripts  and  the  coding 

technique. Codes are tags to give meaning to the information complied (Jennings, 2001). It was 

a  very  useful  technique  since  it  allowed  organization  of  the  data  from  the  interviews  into 

categories that later enhanced the discussions in each theme.   

3.7 Fieldwork Experience 

 

The  fieldwork  required  for  this  study  had  a  period  of  three  months,  more  specifically  from    9th 
January to 9th April 2010. During the first two months I was working as a volunteer in the NGO 

Morrinho. My main task was to teach English to children and teenagers. During that time I was 

living in Santa Teresa, the neighbourhood where Pereira da Silva is located. In my last month I 

lived  in  Ipanema,  in  the  south  area  of  Rio  and  only  twenty  minutes  by  bus  from  Rocinha.  My 

weekly routines consisted of working in the NGO two days a week and then the rest of the time 

would  be  divided  between  Pereira  and  Rocinha.  The  location  of  both  favelas  was  in  opposite 

sides of the city, almost two hours by public transportation. Due to the city size moving around in 

Rio  can  be  a  difficult  and  time  consuming  task.  Therefore  I  intensified  my  data  collection  in 

Pereira while I was living close by and then focused more on Rocinha once I moved to a closer 

area.  

Describing my fieldwork experience is not possible without mentioning my positionality and how it 

influenced  my  research.    The  fact  that  I  am  Portuguese  was  a  key  factor  in  deciding  to 

investigate slum tourism in Brazil, since there is many other places around the world that share 

the same phenomenon. Furthermore being Portuguese facilitated my integration and interaction 

with Brazilians due to the historical background that links both countries.  

22 
 

 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
In relation to a more concrete setting, without mastery of the Portuguese language my research 

would have been extremely difficult not to say impossible since that the great majority of favela 

residents do not speak other languages. Therefore, I can claim that my positionality contributed 

positively to achieving the existing results of this research.  

Included  in  the  constraints,  besides  the  limited  time  to  conduct  fieldwork  there  were  other 

limitations. The time spent in Rio corresponded to summer and then what is popularly known as 

tropical rain season.  As the name suggests, during that period it often rains.  

Due to the general topography of favelas, they are risk zones once it rains because of landslides. 

Therefore,  I  would  usually  avoid  going  to  my  fieldwork  once  the  weather  conditions  were  not 

favourable. Unfortunately, according to national news this year Rio suffered the biggest rain fall 

over the last thirty years which resulted in floods around the city and several landslides in many 

favelas  including  Rocinha.  Thousands  of  people  became  homeless  and  many  others  faced 

death.  This  unexpected  event  forced  me  to  stop  my  fieldwork  for  approximately  two  weeks.  In 

relation to the interviews, although residents were willing to collaborate, often they did not attend 

appointments as arranged. Taking into account this situation plus the distance from one favela to 

the other made the interviewing process become more time consuming than expected.  

As a final remark I would like to express that during the time spent in both case studies I never 

felt unsafe or uncomfortable. I was made very welcome by the residents who always made me 

feel at home. I had the opportunity to meet inspiring people and I have great memories from the 

time spent in Pereira and Rocinha.

4.1 Introduction 

The background chapter is extremely relevant for a better understanding of the data analysis and 
the purpose of this research. It will start with a brief description of Rio de Janeiro followed by an 
overview of the historical development of favelas and its representation in the Brazilian society. 
Furthermore it will present the current situation of favela tourism in Rio de Janeiro.  

 

 

4.2 Background information about Brazil and Rio de 

Janeiro 

 

Brazil  is  located  in  east-central  South  America  and  has  a  population  of  190  million.  Due  to  its 

large  size  it  represents  almost  50%  of  the  entire  South  America  (www.brasilemb.org).  It  is 

internationally  known  for  its  warm  people,  football,  Carnival  and  stunning  nature.  The 

combination of all these elements makes Brazil quite a popular tourism destination. Besides the 

tourism  sector,  the  concentration  of  a large  quantity  of  natural  resources  turned Brazil into  one 

the  fastest  growing  economies  in  the  world,  ranking  the  highest  in  South  America  and  quite 

remarkable one at global level (www.tradingeconomics.com). 

Despite  the  economic  potential  of  Brazil,  this  country  is  strongly  marked  by  a  notorious  social 

inequality. In fact, 10 % of the population earns half of the national income and around 34 % of 

Brazilians  live  below  the  poverty  line  (Janice  E.  Perlman,  2004).  The  socio-economic  Brazilian 

scenario  resulted  in  a  growing  agglomeration  of  very  deprived  urban  areas,  known  as  slums 

(Burgos) mainly located in large scale cities all over the country. Rio de Janeiro, considered one 

of  the  biggest  and  most  relevant  cities  in  Brazil,  is  definitely  a  good  example  of  the  social  gap 

that divides rich and poor. Rio, also known as the Marvellous City, has a population of 10 million 

and 1 out of 5 Brazilians live in a favela. In total, in the last census made in 2009, Rio had 870 

favelas. 

Along with the social division Rio is geographically subdivided into two zones: north and south. 

Each one reflects a different level of socio economic development. The north area is considered 

the poor zone of the city with lack of resources such as public transportation, infra structures and 

so  on.  In  opposition,  the  south  area  is  where  the  resources  and  rich  neighborhoods  are 

concentrated. It is also where you can find all the tourist attractions. For this reason the southern 

area  has a  cosmopolitan environment,  is safer and  receives  a greater attention from  the  public 

24 
 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
power. One can say that the social division in Rio not only outlines the favela factor, it depends 

on which side of the city you belong to.  

 

4.3 Historical Overview of Favelas 

 

For a better understanding of the favela historical roots in Rio de Janeiro, we must go back to the 
19th  century.  At  that  time,  the  urban  and  industrial  growth  of  the  city  attracted  many  European 

emigrants  (Portuguese,  Spanish  and  Italians)  and  recently  emancipated  slaves  who  came  to 

work mainly in construction. At a later stage, rural immigrants from the Northeast of Brazil, a very 

poor  rural  region,  would  join  them  as  well.  The  Imperial  and  later  the  Republican  government 

were  unable  to  provide  adequate  housing  for  the  majority.  Therefore,  the  construction  of 

“Cortiços” – small interior slums- started to rise. In fact, many historians, point out the emergence 

of  Cortiços  as  the  beginning  of  the  slums.  The  Cortiços  were  very  crowded,  unhygienic  and 

located next to the middle and upper class neighbourhoods (Carter, 2005).  

In 1897, a group of soldiers returning from the Canudos war were given permission to settle in 

the Santo António and Providência hills on a temporary basis. Providencia slum, located behind 

the central train station, received the name of Favela due to an abundant bush that surrounded 

the area. This is how the first official favela in Rio de Janeiro was born. In 1920, 26 favelas were 

part of Rio’s setting. This increase is related to the demolition of the already mentioned, Cortiços 

(Freire-Medeiros,  2008).  However,  the  big  boom  in  favela  growth  was  during  the  authoritarian 

Vargas  regime  (also  known  as  the  Estado  Novo  period)  in  1930  and  1940  resulting  in  a  rural 

exodus  to  the  city  (Dwek,  2004).  In  this  political  period,  favelas  started  to  been  seen  as 

problematic.  There  are  two  main  reasons  underlining  this  concerned.  One  is  related  to  their 

intensive  development.  In  the  50s  7%  of  the  city’s  population  were  living  in  favelas  (Abreu  M, 

1987).  The  second motive  concerns  the fact  that  the  government  was  afraid  that  their  dwellers 

would  be  seduced  by  the  communist  ideology.  After  the  military  coup  in  1964  the  government 

decided to take new action: the creation of housing complexes subsidised by the public power. 

The construction of this alternative and temporary accommodation given by the state is attributed 

to the demolition of eighty favelas in the heart of the South zone, the rich area. The removal of 

favelas, specially the well located ones, was the ultimate goal. However, the alternative solution, 

had  very  low  infrastructures,  were  far  away  from  the  city  facilities  and  job  opportunities  (L. 

Valladares,  1978)  Therefore,  many  families  that  were  forcibly  evacuated  to  those  complexes 

rapidly moved to a new favela. Within this cycle, many new small favelas started to rise, reaching 

a  growth  of  74%  between  the  period  of  1968  and  1973  (Abreu  M,  1987).  Consequently,  the 

presence  of  favelas  in  the  strategic  and  rich  areas  like Copacabana,  Ipanema  and  Leblon  was 

never  eliminated.  In  the  late  70s,  after  the  military  dictatorship,  a  new  political  period  started.

Although there was not a well-designed public policy to improve favelas, the demolition was no 

longer a discussed topic. Some started to be partially urbanized and gained basic services like 

electricity and piped water (Preteceille & Valladares, 2000).  

The 80s was even a better decade for the favela destiny, with president Brizola the head of the 

state.  Public  opinion  condemned  violent  police  actions  against  the  favela  residents  and  the 

government launched several projects to improve the living conditions in the favelas. Since 1992 

preservation  and  improvements  of  the  favelas  have  become  part  of  the  public  policies  and  is 

represented  by  the  initiative  named  Favela  Bairro  (Squatter  Settlement  Neighbourhood) 

launched in 1994 by the Housing Department of the Municipal Government of Rio de Janeiro and 

with the financial support of the Inter-American Development Bank. This project aims to reunite 
favelas in to the 2asfalto at a spatial and social level. Therefore, initiatives to design buildings for 

social projects, streets connecting to the surrounding areas, sanitation and other basic services 

are part of it. Nevertheless, there is some criticism about this public project for neglecting the fact 

that  favelas  had  become controlled  by  gang  group (Riley,  Fiori, & Ramirez, 2001). As  it  will  be 

discussed next, despite the public concerns with the expansion and improvement of favelas the 

social  stigma  that  surrounds  its  dwellers  is  still  very  strong  and  justifies  many  violent  and 

repressive actions towards them. 

  

4.4 An Overview of the Representation of Favelas and its 

People 

 

Favelas were the birthplaces of some of the main elements of the Brazilian culture: samba and 

carnival. Nevertheless these areas were constantly associated with strong negative components 

like  criminality,  violence  and  lack  of  hygiene.  This  duality  is  present  t  nowadays.  However,  the 

representation  of  favela  and  their  dwellers,  along  with  the  development  of  society,  has  been 

suffering oscillations and readjustments as will be explained.  

Elimination  of  the  slums,  especially  the  central  ones  (like  Rocinha)  was  considered  by  the 

government  as  the  best  option  till  1970.  The  result  was  segregation  and  marginalization  of  the 

poor  working  class  that  were  living  in  those  areas  (Carter,  2005).  In  fact,  according  to  Janice 

Perelman  (1976)  the  stereotypes  of  the  urban  poor  were  developed  to  justify  the  government 
policies of relocation of favela residents to the periphery. During the early part of the 20th century 

the alleged reason was hygiene and aesthetics. Nevertheless, favelas had a breakthrough with 

the  Modernist  Movement  in  1922.  For  the  first  time  vulnerable  groups  were  considered  part  of

borders

Rio’s society. As a result, the artists of that time considered favela as a symbol of the Brazilian 

cultural diversity. It was the cot of samba and owner of a picturesque beauty. From that time, it 

became  known  that  despite  poverty  and  criminality  also  had  room  for  beauty  and  for  the 

expression of different forms of Brazilian culture. The role of the Modernist Movement resulted in 

the  first  steps  of  the  aestheticization  process  of  the  favelas  and  the  paradoxical  logic  that  are 

beneath  these  places.  Both  elements  are  present  in  the  commodification  process  that  was 

previously in the theoretical chapter.  

In 1930, when Getúlio Vargas was ruling the country favelados were perceived as “pre-citizens” 

without  any  kind  of  rights.  The  creation  of  what  was  already  described  as  the  complexes  was 

based  on  the  excuse  to  end  the  unhealthy  conditions  of  the  favelas,  therefore  their  demolition 

was necessary (Menezes, 2007). In reality, the gradual expansion of the favelas was an extreme 

concern  for  the  most  wealthy  classes  and  owners  of  the  media  at  that  time.  For  the  Rio  de 

Janeiro  elite,  having  their  best  neighbourhoods  occupied  by  poor  people  was  damaging  the 

aesthetic landscape, threatening public security and health (Janice E.   Perlman, 1976).  

According to a research done by Valladares (Baumeister) about the role of the media in Rio de 

Janeiro  in  the  beginning  of  the  XX  century  it  is  revealed  that  newspapers,  after  the  first  official 

slum named Favella appeared, started to associate the word “Favela” with the image of danger, 

unsanitary  conditions and disorder. Favelas were described as a space populated by crooks and 

criminals, suggesting their demolition. Valladares suggests that the dominant groups, through the 

possession  of  the  media,  were  consolidating  and  spreading  a  preconceived  idea  of  the  slums 

and  their  people.  This  strategy  was  so  strong  that  it  spread  also  to  the  general  thinking.  The 

physical and mental distance was a notorious mark on the construction of the favela image. With 

it, a sociocentric posture was built crossing decades and is still dominant today. As we can see, 

the  overall  growth  of  favelas  in  Rio  developed  at  the  same  speed  as  the  marginalization  and 

stigmatization that surrounds these urban areas and their dwellers. 

Although  the  period  that moves  on  till  late  70s presented  the demolition  of favelas as  the main 

solution,  this  phase  was  also  marked  by  the  extreme  capacity  of  the  favela  dwellers  to  resist   

those actions and to organize themselves as a unit of force. The engagement with politics were 

not constant in the daily life in favelas, but during its history every time  the danger of removal or 

the chance of  urbanization was present the communities tended to reinforce their strength as a 

collective  union.  Their  power  was  represented  by  their  community  leaders  and  their  local 

associations.  The  first  resident  associations  were  created  in  1940  as  a  consequence  of  their 

involuntary evacuation to the complexes created by the state. 

With  the  end  of  the  military  dictatorship,  a  new  era  started.  It  was  a  changing  period  in  the 

relationship between state and favelas, especially with their community leaders. They started to 

negotiate  basic  services  and  urbanization  actions  for  the  exchange  of  votes.  At  that  time,  the 

 

27 
 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
government was willing to invest in better infrastructures and was open to a change in the way 

that public power had been dealing with favela and its people. In this process, community leaders 

based  on  their  residents  associations  became  the  main  political  actor  between  favela  and  the 

government. This articulation motivated the residents to join their local associations because that 

represented a job opportunity and control over services (Grynszpan & Pandolfi, 2003). 

During the 80s the Life in favelas, its relation with the government and with Brazilian society in 

general suffered a dramatic change with the introduction of cocaine traffic. The public discourses 

concerning  favelas  and  the  perception  about  their  dwellers  gained  a  more  complex  layer.  One 

could say that, till this date, Rio was seen as a kind of tropical paradise and the favela, despite all 

the negative connotations and struggling periods where seen as places shaped by authenticity, 

popular  culture,  samba  schools  and  religiousness  (Burgos,  2004).  Others  like  Janice  Perlman 

(Janice  E.      Perlman)  claimed  that  favela  residents,  despite  the  adversities  were  generally 

optimistic people, with a strong community sense, cooperative spirit and violence was not part of 

their daily life.  

The presence of trafficking had strong repercussions in the image of favelas. They started to be 

seen  as  places  controlled  by  gang  groups  and  highly  violent  areas.  Consequently,  the  favela 

people came to be seen as dangerous and quite often treated as potential criminals. This abrupt 

change  in  the  representation  of  favelas  and  its  people  had  also  consequences  in  the  image  of 

Rio de Janeiro. The city came to be seen as an unsafe place at a national and international level 

(Zalzuar, 2004).  

This  transformation  was  not  only  at  an  external  level.  Internal  dynamics  in  the  favela  also 

changed  dramatically.  The  residents  had  to  become  submissive  to  the  laws  of  the  drug  lord  in 

their favela. In order to avoid possible conflicts a new regime reigns: the law of silence. Favela 

dwellers are extremely cautious in speaking about the fact that their lives coexist with trafficking 

and violence. It is almost like a tabu issue not only with outsiders but even among residents. It is 

a strategy to cope with it, to guarantee self-protection, to avoid being considered accomplices or 

even informers by others.  

The  fear  of  expression  also  reached  the  local  associations.  Community  leaders  don’t  speak 

about  what  the  residents  have  to  endure  in  their  daily  lives.  The  leaders  as  residents  are  also 

under the same pressure and the actions of the resident associations are quite often shaped by 

the  parallel  power.  This  situation  resulted  in  a  disbelief  of  their  strength  as  a  key  and 

representative  element.  Slowly  many  dwellers  started  losing  interest  in  their  collective 

organizations.  Therefore,  the  image  of  the  local  associations  as  a  democratic  space  and  a 

source of voice of the favela dwellers is no longer the same.  

Although  the  government  still  recognizes  the  resident  associations  as  the  political  actor  of  the 

favelas, because of their proximity with the parallel power their reputation is often questionable. 

28 
 

 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
To reinforce that, there have been official cases of community leaders associated with the drug 

lords (Rocha, 2009). 

As  we  have  seen  the  favelas  representation  and  their  relation  with  the  rest  of  society  have 

constantly  been  reshaped  according  to  the  historical  background  and  the  introduction  of  new 

elements. However, Valladares (2005) claims that the research material produced in the last 30 

years  associates  favelas  with  a  simplified  amount  of  features.  The  general  consensus  about 

them  made  those  features  become  “unquestionably  true”  being  translated  in  the  following 

dogmas: first due to their history favelas are always seen as very specific and unique places. The 

Second one is related to the social image of its dwellers. Favelas are considered exclusively the 

home  of  the  poor.  Finally,  Favelas  are  constantly  being  portrayed  as  a  homogenous  territory, 

although they possess a quite plural reality internally and also in comparison with others, there is 

a big tendency to see them as a singular place.  

Nevertheless, this universal vision based on the three dogmas clashes with the current complex 

and  sophisticated  reality  that  surrounds  favelas.  Nowadays,  favelas  have  access  to  recent 

technologies  like internet and  cable  tv,  becoming  accessible  and  in  contact  with  the  rest  of  the 

world.  Favelas  are  no  longer  a  closed  system,  some  receive  tourists  from  everywhere.    Those 

are some of the new components that show that favelas are open to modernity and the previous 

popular vision needs to be contested.  

 

4.5 Favela Tourism in Rio de Janeiro 

 

Organized  tours  to  favelas  may  be  seen  as  a  recent  phenomenon,  but  some  people  point  out 

that in the decade of 1940 sporadic some international visitors used to go inside the favela with 

the urge of finding “an exotic world”. There is not precisely a date for when officials tours started 

but  all  the  research  done  so  far  refers  to  the  Earth  Summit  (Rio  Conference  on  Environmental 

and sustainable development) in 1992 as the kick off moment for the official tours. Since then, it 

has become a systematic activity and favelas are officially seen as a tourist destination  (Freire-

Medeiros). 

Nevertheless,  not  all  the  favelas  can  be  turned  into  a  tourist  commodity.  They  have  to 

correspond  to  some  pre-established  requirements  such  as:  breath  taking  views  to  nature  and 

also  the  inequality  existing  in  Rio.  Favelas  located  in  the  south  area  of  the  city  (which  is  the 

richest and tourist area) and on hills are preferable as well. On top of this, only the “light version” 

can actually become touristic, which means that there must be a pacific environment (as much 

as possible) in order to guarantee the safety of the tourists.   

 

29 
 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
Although, it is part of the public awareness that favelas are controlled by drug lords their possible 

connection to the tourism agencies remains a mystery. However, in the case of Rocinha such a 

link is not possible to observe, in others like Prazeres a phone call from the “boss” of the favela 

was enough to stop the tours (Freire-Medeiros). 

Favela  tourism is highly  contested among  Brazilian  public opinion.  Such controversy  is  clear  in 
some  comments  about  an  article  related  to  the  topic  in  an  important  newspaper  “O  Globo”3:  

“Only in Brazil people like to be treated as animals!”; “the 50.00 dollars that the tourist pays goes 

to  the  traffic,  because  without  their  permission  there  is  no  tourism.”;  “Favela  is  not  a  touristic 

point.  Favela  is  a  social  problem!”;  “The  first  world  people  come  here  to  see  the  poverty  and 

misery that they only know in books!” “How long will the favela continue to exist? Besides being a 

refugee for criminals, it is now also a human zoo for foreign perverts?” 

Furthermore,  a  recent  survey  made  by  the  newspaper  “O  Estado  de  Sao  Paulo”4  to  find  out  if 

favela  tourism  should  be  supported,  revealed  that  80%  of  the  people  that  participated  were 

against  (Menezes,  2007).  In  order  to  understand  how  this  phenomenon  represents  such  a  big 

dilemma  for  the  Brazilians  it  is  necessary  to  take  into  account  the  previous  historical  analysis. 

The  media  discourses  of  Rio  de  Janeiro  and  Brazil  started  portraying  favelas  as  very  negative 

areas, the residence of criminals. The public assumptions reflect the same vision. One may see 

now  how  extremely  hard  it  is  to  accept  that  an  area  that  is  related  to  mainly  negative 

connotations can represent Brazil internationally and become a tourist attraction. The majority of 

the  residents  in  Rio  want  to  keep  a  physical  and  mental  distance  from  their  slums.  Finally,  we 

may  conclude  that:  although  favela  eradication  is  no  longer  a  policy,  the  stereotypes  and  the 

social constructions about the favela and their inhabitants remain till today (Carter, 2005).  

Despite  the  potential  of  favela  tourism  and  its  growing  popularity,  it  is  a  sensitive  topic  for  the 

Brazilian government. In 1996 the association of favela and tourism was unacceptable. However 

the relationship between the government and favela tourism has been changing. No longer can 

the  government  claim  that  favelas  interrupt  the  flow  of  tourists  because  it  has  become  an 

important element of tourist attraction. As recognition of its value, In September 2006 the mayor 

allocated Rocinha as an official tourist site. After that, Rio tour, the official tourism office of Rio de 

Janeiro, included the same favela in their official guide (Freire-Medeiros, 2009).

Section One 

 

5.1 Introduction  

This chapter consists in an analysis of the data collected during the fieldwork experience. It will 

provide the reader with more in-depth knowledge of the complex dynamics in each case and how 

tourism is perceived by the residents in both favelas. This chapter is subdivided in two sections. 

The first one consists in a description of each case study.  More precisely it will inform the reader 

about the historical background, the tourism scenario and the key actors that take an active role 

in the tourism development of each favela. The information provided in this section will be a good 

basis  for  the  understanding  of  the  following  one  which  corresponds  to  the  analysis  of  the 

collected  data.  The  information  was  gathering  having  the  previous  selected  concepts-  local 

participation,  self-esteem,  dialogue  and  aspirations  in  mind.  The  interaction  among  actors  was 

also  an  importing  guiding  element  during  fieldwork.  Nevertheless,  is  not  officially  considered  a 

concept because it was used mainly to translate the existing dynamics that surrounds the tourism 

development  in  each  favela.  The  data  collected  is  presented  in  three  dimensions:  local 

involvement versus hegemony of actors; social dimension in which the concepts of self-esteem 

and dialogue are the main guidance and finally  future aspirations, which reflects the vision of the 

community  towards  tourism,  giving  an  insight  of  how  the  residents  face  tourism  and  what  role 

tourism can play in their lives.  

 

5.2 Case study Rocinha: the historical background  

 

Rocinha is located on a steep hill in the southern area of the city more precisely in between the 

luxurious neighbourhoods of Sao Conrado and Gávea. Rocinha means small farm and its name 

is  related  to  its  rural  past.  Around  1930  the  first  residents  started  to  settle  there.  At  that  time 

Rocinha’s  land  was  part  of  an  old  farm  named  Quebra-  Cangalha.  The  main  basis  of  the 

residents’ livelihood consisted of agriculture. They used to cultivate for themselves and to sell it 

in the main market of the south zone area. 

Rocinha  started  to  grow  very  quickly  during  the  50s  and  60s  with  the  urban  development  of 

nearby  neighbourhoods  like  Gávea,  Leblon,  Ipanema  and  Jardim  Botanico.  At  that  time,  the 

favela was home to many emigrants from the northeast part of the country that moved to Rio with 

the  hope  of  finding  a  job  in  the  construction  field  (www.favelatemmemoria.com.br).  During  the 

military  dictatorship,  there  were  several  attempts  to  demolish  this  favela,  however  strong 

resistance from the community managed to stop its complete removal. 

31 
 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
Many residents claim that Rocinha is the biggest favela in Latin America. It is hard to be precise, 

because  thousands  of  houses  lack  addresses,  but  the  most  recent  estimation  points  out  that 

Rocinha possesses around 200.000 inhabitants.  

Nowadays  it  is  subdivided  into  20  neighbourhoods,  Roupa  Suja  being  the  poorest  one.  The 

locals of  the  poorest  areas  often make  their  living by  being  trash  collectors.  A  large  part  of  the  

residents  work  outside  the  favela  mainly  in  hotels,  restaurants,  construction  and  in  the  rich 

neighbourhood  houses  as  maids,  cooks,  babysitter,  gardeners,  drivers  and  security  guards 

(Carter, 2005). 

The local  economy  in  Rocinha  is  very  impressive.  Legal  and  illegal  commerce  blossoms  in  the 

main areas. It is even possible to find external companies (like popular food chains) that decided 

to  open  a  business  in  Rocinha  because  it  is  profitable.  Therefore,  one  can  find  a  range  of 

services:  banks,  clinics,  beauty  salons,  restaurants,  supermarkets,  clothes  shops,  travel 

agencies and even at one time a McDonalds. Rocinha has a locally based channel TVROC and 

its  own  community  newspaper  Rocinha  Noticias.  Due  to  the  topography  of  Rocinha  the  most 

common way to get around is by moto taxi. Rocinha has around 300 moto taxis operating inside 

the favela, making this service one of the most developed and requested.   

This  favela  received  the  status  of  bairro  (Neighborhood)  by  the  municipality  in  1992  but  is  still 

seen and considered a favela because not all the population has access to basic services and it 

is  still  quite  controlled  by  the  parallel  power.  In  fact,  due  to  its  proximity  to  the  richest 

neighborhoods of Rio, Rocinha is a very profitable drug selling point and in 2004 it was the stage 
of a 40 day war between two main rival gangs: Comando Vermelho5 and Amigos dos Amigos6. 

This resulted in the transference of power to the latter. At that time Mcdonals closed and never 

reopened (http://favelatour.org/about/rocinha/).  

Rocinha is quite an unusual favela. Besides its particular location it was the place where some 

“favela trends” started, like the moto taxi business and the local newspaper. As usual as this, it 

was  also  the  place  where  the  government  opened  the  first  nursery  inside  a  favela.  A  quite 

relevant service that is still not present in many favelas.  

Besides the range of business, which is also not a common reality, another unique feature is the 

social class differences inside Rocinha. Nowadays one can find an internal social distinction by 

the  new  middle  class  apartment  blocks.  Rocinha  also  became  the  main  destination  of  national 

and  international  NGOs  concentrating  a  large  number  of  different  social  projects.  Following 

Rocinha’s tradition as an initiator of trends, it was also the first favela to receive official tourism.

5.3 Tourism Scenario in Rocinha  

 

Tourism in Rocinha started in 1992, leading the way to favela tourism in Brazil. The trigger was 

the curiosity of a group of tourists during the Earth Summit. In 2000 it became part of the official 

city  guide by  Riotour,  the  organization  responsible for promoting  and  developing  tourism in  Rio 

de Janeiro.  

The tourism side of Rocinha is mainly explored by external agencies. In the high session there is 

tours every day, amounting to more than two thousand visitors a month. The tour agencies fight 

among themselves to diversify their service. Therefore, one can choose to do a tour by walking, 

in a small van, moto taxi or even in a safari jeep.  

The main travel reasons pointed out by the agencies to justify why Rocinha is a such profitable 

tourism  product  are:  location  close  to  hotels,  the  breath  taking  views  (as  you  can  see from  the 

picture) and because  it is  placed in between  two  rich  areas  which gives  the  opportunity  for the 

visitors  to  see  the  visual  contrast  that  quite  often  is  part  of  the  geographic  imagination  of  Rio 

(Freire-Medeiros, 2008), as it can be proved by the following illustration.

5.3.1 External Actors: Tour Operators 

As  was  explained  before,  the  tourism  activities  started  with  and  are  still  mainly  explored  by 

external agencies. Nowadays there are seven tour operators: Be a local, Exotic tours, Don’t Be a 

Gringo, Favela Tour, Jeep tour, Indiana Jungle Tour, Private Tours and Rio Adventures. There is 

a  big  dispute  to  possess  the  status  of  pioneer,  but  many  people  claim  that  Favela  Tours  by 

Marcelo  Armstrong  was  one  of  the  first  agencies  to  operate  there  and    the  only  one  that  does 

exclusive favela tours.  

 

5.3.2 Internal Actors: Resident Association and Local 

Tourism Organization 

 

Residents Association 

Among the several actors that one can find in the hectic Rocinha, the most relevant one is União 

Pró-Melhoramentos  dos  Moradores  da  Rocinha  (UPMMR),  the  Residents  Association  of 

Rocinha.  This association  is  considered in  government  eyes  as  the  representative  institution  of 

Rocinha. It was founded on August 21 in 1961. During all these years it has been a key actor in 

many political struggles such was the fight for water and electricity in the 70s (www.rocinha.org). 

Nowadays their main activities are: to guarantee basic services to the community, represent their 

rights in the Government and City hall, supervise constructions and provide certificates for selling 

and buying properties.   

Despite the active role of this association in managing Rocinha and satisfying resident’s needs, 

surprisingly as the current president Leonardo Rodrigues explained, their connection to tourism 

is nonexistent.  He claimed that he is aware of the growing development of tourism and the fact 

that  it is mainly  run  by  external private  companies.  He  revealed  dissatisfaction  while  explaining 

the lack of communication between them and the agencies: “They should communicate with us, 

but they don‟t. They just come and do it. I think they should communicate with the association so 

we could send someone with them to show some places in Rocinha that they don‟t know”. 

Furthermore,  Leonardo  showed  feeling  concerned  about  the  current  dominant  form  of  tourism, 

criticizing the lack of knowledge of the guides and their attitude: “They (agencies) sell a false tour 

to the tourists because they show almost nothing of Rocinha” and “the guides don’t even allow 

the tourists to buy a bottle of water”.  

 

34 
 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
When asked why the association, does not try to change it, Leonardo promptly justified the lack 

of human resources and skills to actually take some control over tourism. The lack of cooperation 

extends also to the Local Government, since transforming Rocinha into an official tourist point in 

September  2006  did  not  result  in  any  dialogue  with  the  Association  or  with  any  other  actor. 

According to the president it didn’t promote any change.  

The  lack  of  coordination  among  political  actors  is  also  present  at  an  internal  level.  The 

connection between this Association and the one related to tourism (the one that follows below) 

is nonexistent as well. When asked about why the Association didn’t support the initiatives of the 

only  internal  tourism  organization  he  replied  that:  “They  are  trying  to  take  their  own  benefit  but 

does not work because they don’t know what they are doing. You must only do what you know. 

They want to do something about it but do it all wrong”. The low credibility that the President has 

about this organization was clear. The real reasons remain a mystery but I speculate that conflict 

of interests can be the trigger.  

Local Tourism Organization 

At  a  local  level  an  organization  named  Secretaria  de  Turismo  that  can  be  translated  as  the 
Tourism  Organization7  was  formed  in  2009  by  a  group  of  6  residents.  Their  members  are 

composed of people who have been involved in social movements in Rocinha, who have worked 

for Residents Association or have higher education. Some of them are well known in the favela, 

like the president Ailton Macarrão. Unfortunately it was not possible to reach him but there was 

an  opportunity  to  interview  Hélio  Almeida  responsible  for  the  communication  and  Fernando 
Ermiro the secretary.  

The aim of this organization is to implement a model of tourism that is more community oriented 

and  with  development  goals.  Their  ideal  vision  is  to  have  the  possibility  to  offer  different  tours, 

giving  a  chance  for  tourists  to  visit  social  projects,  participate  in  workshops  like  Capoeira  and 

Samba classes, and eat traditional Brazilian food and to get to know a more in-depth history of 

Rocinha explained by a local guide. They want tourists to understand their context, their relation 

with the government, their struggles in the past, current social issues that they face but also what 

is positively developed by the community. Their goal is not only to reach international tourists but 

also Brazilians living in Rio.  

 

                                                             
7 The translation is not literally because the Portuguese word “secretaria” doesn’t exist in English. 
However they present themselves as a tourism organization. So the translation is more related with 
their role than with their official name

5.4 Case Study Pereira da Silva: Historical Background   

 

The favela Pereira da Silva or Pereirao as it is now popularly called is located on a steep hill in 

between  two  neighborhoods:  Laranjeiras  and  Santa  Teresa.  At  the  top  and  bottom  part  of  the 

favela there is an exit corresponding to each district.  

The  beginning  of  the  settlement  in  that  area  started  a  long  time  ago.  It  is  hard  to  precise,  but 

residents claim that the favela has existed for 70 years and the oldest families arrived in 1960.  

At  that  time  the  land  belonged  to  a  coffee  farm  and  the  lifestyle  was  marked  by  a  rural 

atmosphere.  It  was  like  living  on  a  small  farm.  Vegetation  and  fruit  trees  were  part  of  the 

landscape. Few families were living there so there was enough space between houses and the 

environment was very friendly. Everybody knew each other; it was a quite close community. Kids 

used  to  call  their  neighbors:  “uncle”  and  “aunt”.  At  that  time  the  infrastructures  were  practically 

nonexistent: there was no pavement on the streets, no electricity and no water.  

Despite  the  improvements  in  life  conditions  today,  some  residents  are  unhappy  that  along  with 

urbanization  came  the  expansion  of  the  favela.  Today  you  can  find  3500  inhabitants;  however 

the  favela  is  still  growing  because  many  people  are  moving  because  of  the  “tranquil” 

atmosphere.  In  fact,  the  environment  of  today’s  Pereira  da  Silva  was  a  conquest  after  many 

years  of  struggle.  In  1990,  this  favela  was  one  of  the  most  popular  drug  selling  points  of  the 

southern area of the city. It possesses a strategic location. The bottom part is connected to the 

southern area and the top is part of the central zone of the city, plus the selling point itself was 

quite  close  to  the  exit.  This  time  was  characterized  by  constant  violent  conflicts  between  the 

police  and  the  traffickers.  Usually  those  confrontations  happened  in  the  morning  and  late 

afternoon. Matching with the time table of working people and children’s school time.  

This tense environment culminated in 1998 when the police murder the drug lord of Pereira da 

Silva. The violent episodes that occurred during that time had big coverage in the media because 

this  favela  is  quite  close  to  the  headquarters’  of  the  State  Government  and  to  the  Governor 

official  house.  Therefore,  this  favela  was  the  chosen  one  to  became  a  role  model  of  the  new 

security project designed by the government and named as “Murtirao da Paz”. One of the main 

features of this initiative was to give special attention to the children and teenagers. The goal was 

to help their integration in society through social projects.  

Nevertheless,  this  program  was  never  really  implemented  as  expected.  However,  the  iniciative 
that  still  remains  was  the  relocation  of  the  BOPE8  (Batalhão  de  Operações Policiais Especiais) 

headquarters to a street next to the favela exit (the one close to the selling point) in 2000.  This 

                                                             
8 BOPE is the special police force created in 1978 to interfere only when the military police can’t 
control the situation anymore. They usually operate in the favelas to search for drug dealers   

36

event  had  a  strong  influence  in  the  life  of  the  residents  since  they  associate  the  sense  of 

“tranquility”  that  they  now  live  with  the  presence  of  the  police  close  by.  Therefore,  the  fact  that 

this favela reached a stage where there are no more armed traffickers controlling the area due a 

government intervention makes this place a rare example among other favelas that are also free 

but based on the intervention of ex-police men that charge a monthly price to guarantee security.  

However, this favela is still under the power of the Comando Vermelho  (Red Command) gang. 

Consequently, despite the fact that the presence of armed people is not as visible as before, the 

residents still behave in a controlled way, just as in the favelas where the trafficking is notorious. 

One  can  say  that  the  dynamic  of  Pereira  da  Silva  makes  its  “tranquility”  a  quite  fragile  one 

(Rocha, 2009).  

 

5.5 Tourism Scenario in Pereira da Silva 

 

As  in  other  favelas,  tourism  also  reached  Pereira  da  Silva  but  in  a different  rhythm  and  setting 

compared to Rocinha. It is far less developed, started only in 2005 and is mainly locally run. The 

tourism  scenario  of  this  favela  consists  of:  a  hostel  named  Favelinha,  and  an  art  production 

made by the favela kids which is considered the main attraction of this area. It was due to this art 

project that walking tours started. The NGO Morrinho is the only organization that is responsible 

for it. Because of its relevance in the community and the fact that two months of volunteer work 

was  conducted  with  them  that  this  organization  is considered  in  this  study  as  the  main  tourism 

actor.  For  a  better  understanding,  below  it  is  possible  to  find  pictures  corresponding  to  each 

project taken during fieldwork.

5.5.1 External Actors: Bed and Breakfast Network  

 

As was said before, the tourism activities started and are run mainly by local residents. However, 

there is an external organization named Cama e Café that supports Morrinho. Although external 

actors in the case of Pereira are practically nonexistent and are not the main focus of this study, 

a  small  description  of  Cama  e  Café  is  given  in  order  to  provide  a  wider  picture  about  the 

development and the role of tourism in this case study.   

Cama e Café is the first bed and breakfast network in Brazil. It operates in Rio de Janeiro and 

Olinda  but  its  office  is  in  Rio,  more  precisely  in  the  Santa  Teresa  neighborhood.  The  idea  was 

implemented  by  Joao  Vergara  and  its  aim  was  to  develop  a  sustainable  tourism  model  in  the 

Santa  Teresa  district  based  on  improving  the  chances  of  income  generation  in  this  area. 

Therefore, his mission was to motivate residents to candidate themselves to host tourists in their 

homes  and  to  develop  a  cultural  and  gastronomic  guide  covering  the  most  relevant  spots  of 

Santa Teresa.  The goal is to make tourists enjoy their stay as much as possible and to spread 

the economic benefits to other areas of Santa Teresa.   

The  idea  of  supporting  a  social  project  in  one  of  the  several  favelas  in  Santa  Teresa  was  a 

possibility  included  in  the  vision  of  Cama  e  Café.  The  person  responsible  for  this  organization 

see this initiative as part of the social responsibility of the company and of himself as a citizen. 

Once he got to know the art production and the boys he decided to start a partnership that has 

been going on since 2005.  

 

38 
 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
Cama e Café is responsible for promoting the tourist side of Morrinho by increasing their network 

with  other  tourism  actors  and  arranging  financial  support  through  projects  financed  by  the 

Ministry  of  Tourism.  No  financial  return  goes  to  Cama  e  Café.  Their  support  to  Morrinho  is 

completely voluntary.  

 

5.5.2 Internal Actors: NGO Morrinho and Hostel Favelinha 

 

NGO Morrinho 

Morrinho is a small scale model of several favelas with 320 square meters. It is made of bricks 

and  recycled  material  and  its  inhabitants  are  made  of  lego  pieces.  Young  boys  play  with  it 

reproducing  the  best  and  the  worse  side  of  living  in  favelas.  For  a  better  understanding  of  the 

project description, please see the pictures below. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FIGURE 4: MORRINHO PROJECT, FIELDWORK JANUARY 18TH, 2010 

 

It  started  in  1997  when  at  the  age  of  14 Nelciclan Souza  de  Oliveira  arrived  in Rio de Janeiro. 

Coming from a small city Nelcilan went to Pereira to live with his parents. That was the first time 

he  had  seen  or  lived  in  a  favela.  He  was  so  impressed  by  his  new  reality  that  he  started  to 

reproduce it in his backyard with bricks and paint, leftovers from his father’s work in construction. 

Other motives like free time, lack of money to buy toys and scarcity of safe places to play also 

 

39 
 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
contributed to the creation of Morrinho and the inclusion  of another seven boys. Each boy was 

the  “owner”  of  one  favela  and  was  responsible  for  its  maintenance,  construction  and  its 

inhabitants.  These  micro  favelas  represent  real  ones  like  Fogueteiro,  Prazeres,  Borel,  Grota, 

Turano,  Querosene,  Fallete,  Encontro,  among  others.  Morrinho  became  their  daily  game  and 

their safe leisure spot during the violent times of Pereira.  

In  2001,  the  film  directors  Fábio  Gavião  and  Marco  Oliveira,  through  one  of  the  boys’  teacher, 

decided to make a documentary about Morrinho and included the boys in the production. In fact, 

it was the boys that actually filmed themselves while reproducing episodes of daily life in favelas. 

These  encounters  with  favela  kids  and  outside  boys  created  the  path  for  the  representation  of 

Morrinho as an artistic production outside the favela walls and the creation of Morrinho as NGO. 

This  project  gradually  attracted  media  attention  and  participated  in  several  international  events 

like the Urban world summit in Barcelona (2004); Venice Bienal (2007); Brazilian contemporary 

art festival in Rotterdam (2008) among other international and national exhibitions.  

As  an  NGO  Morrinho  works  in  four  different  fields:  Tv  Morrinho  (production  of  audio  visual 

material),  Expo  Morrinho  (exhibition  and  reproduction  of  the  scale  model),  Social  Morrinho 

(providing courses for local kids in film production and foreign language) and Tourism Morrinho 

(tours to see the model and the NGO headquarter).  

In relation to the tours, according to Nelciclan they started in 2003 after participating in an annual 

exhibition  Portas  Abertas  (Open  doors)  that  took  place  in  Parque  das  Ruinas,  a  park  in  Santa 

Teresa.  Visitors  showed  interest  in  Morrinho’s  picture  and  wanted  to  see  the  real  scale  model. 

This  way,  they  started  to  take  the  visitors  to  see  the  real  Morrinho.  After  that,  informal  tours 

continued  till  2005  when  they  made  a  partnership  with  Cama  e  Café  and  started  to  receive 

official  tourists.  Nowadays  they  are  connected  with  six  agencies,  one  of  them  Iko  Poran,  that 

allocates  volunteers  to  work  temporarily  with  them.  Nevertheless,  Cama  e  Café  is  seen  by 

Morrinho members as the key element that initiated and motivated actions in the tourism field.  

 

Pousada Favelinha 

The  Pousada  Favelinha  was  the  first  hostel  in  a  favela  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  and  it  is  open  since 

2005. The owner is a young Brazilian woman named Andreia da Silva. It was during the time as 

an  emigrant  in  Europe  that  Andreia  got  to  know  about  the  concept  of  hostel.  later,  when  she 

returned to her country she decided to open one. The hostel has five rooms and has a maximum 

capacity  of  15  people.  It’s  located  in  the  top  part  of  the  favela,  close  to  Morrinho,  and  has  an 

amazing view to the Guanabara bay and Sugar loaf.

The  promotion  and  advertisement  of  this  business  is  completely  done  by  internet.  And  it  is 

through the website http://www.favelinha.com/en/index.php that the reservations are made. The 

information is only in English because the potential customers are mainly European or American. 

As Andreia says” Brazilians are afraid of favelas”.  

This project is so exceptional that it is part of the list of the most unusual and unique hotels in the 

world  (http://www.unusualhotelsoftheworld.com/).  In  fact,  for  being  seen  as  a  radical  idea  this 

initiative  had  a  strong  impact  in  the  Brazilian  media.  Notorious  newspapers  like  “Folha  de  São 

Paulo” or “Globo” did articles about it. Even a Dutch journal interviewed Andreia. In the website is 

possible to read some of this interview and the other articles .  

 

Section Two  

5.6 Qualitative Data Analysis 

 

5.6.1 Introduction  

In  this  section  the  data  collected  from  the  case  studies  is  presented  in  themes,  each  one 

corresponding to a specific topic and concept. Each case study will be evaluated individually. At 

the end, the data from each favela will merge and be analyzed based on the theoretical pillar of 

this study.   

 

5.6.2 Theme 1: Local Involvement Versus Hegemony of 

Actors 

 

The main focus of this theme is the interaction of the community towards tourism development. 

In that sense, local participation is the concept used in order to understand the role of residents 

(or at least some) in relation to the tourism activities offered in each favela. The objective of this 

subsection  is  to  discuss  later  on,  if  local  participation  can  contribute  to  improve  the  positive 

effects  of  favela  tourism.  Due  to  the  complexity  of  this  concept  within  favela  tourism,  at  an 

empirical level it was possible to identify several obstacles from different fields. Each one will be 

discussed in particular.  

Rocinha faced a fast growing tourism and an increase in demand in the last few years. It is not 

possible to point only one reason to justify the tourism boom but the internationalization of favela 

image  and  the  attribution  of  glamour  by  movies  and  other  art  forms  definitely  contributed. 

Although the presence of tourists can be seen on a daily basis, especially during the high tourism 

season in Rio, the interaction of locals with it is almost invisible. There is only a small group of 

41 
 

 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
residents connected to the industry. More precisely six local guides doing their own tours and a 

small group of art craft artists that spontaneously decided to expose their stalls in one of the main 

streets. It is not possible to point out only one reason to explain this fact. This reality is a result of 

the combination of several factors. Some have been explained to me others are more obvious, 

such as the hegemony and dominance of external actors.  

Once entering in Rocinha the element that stands out the most is the imbalance between internal 

and  external  actors.  At  a  superficial  level,  the  presence  of  external  travel  agencies  is  far more 

notorious  in  quantity  and  in  performance.  There  are  six  agencies  working  on  a  daily  basis. 

Usually  the  tours  are  done  twice  a  day,  with  large  groups  (around  20  people)  using  vans, 

motorcycles  or  jeeps  to  circulate  inside  the  favela..  The  first  impression  that  one  gets  from 

observing  such  scenario  is  that  the  travel  agencies  are  a  far  more  active  group  and  the 

interaction between locals and tourists is very limited.   

At  a  more  in-depth  level,  the  dominance  of  travel  agencies  is  reinforced  and  explained.    The 

president  of  the  Residents  Association,  Leonardo  Rodrigues,  explains  that  there  is  no 

involvement between  the travel  agencies  and  the  community  and  no  communication. Leonardo 

argued that there was never an initiative from the owners of the travel agencies to approach the 

association. Both parties never discussed what should be seen during the tours, the role of the 

community or even just to get permission to circulate in the favela. Surprisingly, it seems that the 

private  travel  agencies  do  not  need  to give  any  justification or explanation  to  the most  relevant 

actor  in  Rocinha.  When  confronted  about  their  passive  attitude,  Leonardo  justified  the  lack  of 

human resources, knowledge and lack of connections with tourism actors as the main reasons to 

explain why they do not make an effort to obtain more control over the tourism activities.  

Besides  not  being  able  to  participate  in  the  decision  making  process  the  Resident  Association 

also  did  not  take  any  part  in  the  benefits  distribution.  In  fact,  according  to  Leonardo  the 

community  does  not  get  any  kind  of  benefit  from  the  travel  agencies.  He  explained  that 

economically they do not  give any share of the profits and except from art craft; they block the 

possibility of tourists of purchasing anything from their local services. It seems that the chance of 

increasing  the  local  economy  through  tourism  is  not  a  possibility.  In  terms  of  social  benefits, 

Leonardo  pointed  out  that  such  opportunity  is  not  visible  because  none  of  the  travel  agencies 

contribute  to  any  local  project  or  support  an  NGO.  Leonardo  believes  that  the  agencies  are 

disconnected from Rocinha needs and reality.  

The critical view of the President of the Resident Association is shared by other residents. Both 

members  of  the  local  tourism  organization  Fernando  Ermiro  (the  secretary)  and  Hélio  Almeida, 

responsible  for  the  communication  affairs,  explained  that  the  creation  of  this  organization  is  a 

consequence  of  their  dissatisfaction  as  residents  about  the  way  tourism  is  being  exploited  in 

Rocinha.  They  label  the  agencies  action  as  invasive  and  not  contributing  at  all  to  the 

 

42 
 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
improvement  of  Rocinha.  Nevertheless,  it  is  the  lack  of  involvement  with  the  community  that 

consist their core argument against the actual tourism development in Rocinha. In their opinion 

the  tours  are  very  commercial  and  do  not  promote  any  chance  for  tourists  to  interact.  Also  the 

fact that the guides are outsiders was also mentioned as an extra argument to reinforce the poor 

engagement from the travel agencies towards Rocinha.  

Although residents that are connected with tourism reveal a more critical opinion about the travel 

agencies, locals that do not work with tourism also share a similar point of view. In general both 

sides argue that in terms of decision making the community was never approached in any way. 

There was never any action to stimulate residents’ awareness and to grasp locals’ opinion about 

having tourists in their neighbourhood. They all share the idea that the way that tourism is being 

developed  so  far  is  not  the  most  appropriate  because  it  does  not  give  anything  back  to  the 

community. Their main argument is that the agencies should  hire local guides. It might be seen 

as  an  obvious  argument,  but  this  notion  is  also  shared  by  those  who  are  not  connected  with 

tourism. The reason why will be explored in another theme but in terms of participation it reflects 

the  lack  of  local  involvement  in  tourism.  Also  highlighted  was  the  fact  that  the  agencies  do  not 

make any contribution to the improvement of living conditions in the favela.  

Benefit sharing was also a contested topic and several criticisms were made about the fact that 

the travel agencies do not support any social project. In fact, they do not  even have to follow any 

source of  regulation.  As Carlos Souza  (local  guide)  stated:  “the  agencies  come  and  go without 

giving  any  explanation”.  Besides  being  socially  alienated  some  agencies  were  accused  of 

exploiting  the  art  craft  artists  by  charging  a  fee  for  each  item  sold.  As  Zezinho,  a  local  guide 

explained,  the  travel  agency  Be  a  local  takes  tourists  to  a  certain  art  studio  but  charges  a 

commission  fee  and  does  not  allow  those  artists  to  show  their  work  to  tourists  from  other 

agencies.  Without  compromising  the  credibility  of  such  information,  I  want  to  highlight  that  this 

was not confirmed or even mentioned by the artist that I spoke to. 

Still regarding the same topic, besides the fact that the level of benefits reaching the community 

is very low only a restrict group have access to it. This means that only the residents that work 

with  tourism  can  get  access  to  the  benefits  of  having  tourists  in  their  neighbourhood.  This 

situation causes uncomfortable feelings. It even caused dissent, as it can be revealed by Daniel, 

who runs a local NGO, statement:” What difference makes benefiting 5 people if I cannot benefit 

the whole community or at least a large part of it? If I am a guide I will benefit but what about if I 

am not? I think as being a resident I should benefit too!”  

 Among  the  arguments  about  the  contribution  of  economic  or  even  social  benefits  to  the 

community,  it  is  possible  to  see  a  different  vision  expressed  by  Eduardo  Casais,  a  local 

journalist.  From  his  point  of  view,  the  agencies  should  not  economically  share  its  benefits  with 

the  community  because  if  locals  want Rocinha  to  be  seen  as an integrative element  in  the  city 

 

43 
 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
the agencies should not be obliged to share their profit or support local projects. Furthermore, he 

claims  that  the  improvement  of  life  conditions  should  not  relay  on  tourism  but  on  the  public 

power.  In  his  view,  it  is  the  government  that  is  the  responsible  actor  and  not  agencies. 

Nevertheless,  he  states  that  external  agencies  can  indeed  give  some  space  for  locals  to 

participate by hiring local people.  

During the several informal conversations while collecting data in Rocinha it was evident, as was 

said  before,  that  in  terms  of  local  involvement  there  are  several  obstacles.  The  complexity  of 

Rocinha reality and the strong presence of external forces make local participation a very difficult 

target.  The  first  and  most  obvious  obstacle  is  the  power  of  the  external  actor  in  terms  of 

resources  (contacts  within  the  tourism  industry,  skills  and  financial  capital)  compared  to  local 

initiatives. The competition with local guides is unfair and almost impossible to balance. Besides 

the  uneven  power  in  access  to  tourism  development,  there  are  no  signs  of  communication 

between  the  external  actor  and  the  community  which  reinforces  the  hegemony  of  the  travel 

agencies. Despite the imbalanced relationship between the community and the external forces, 

internally it was possible to identify other barriers that must be addressed.  

Culture  plays  a  fundamental  role  in  shaping  the  way  an  individual  thinks  and  acts.  As    was 

explained  by  Fernando  Ermir,  the  secretary  of  the  local  tourism  organization,  Rocinha  is  the 

mirror of the Brazilian culture. As he stated: “Rocinha is a small Brazil. You have a chance but 

you don‟t do anything to take it.” In order to explain why the community doesn’t assume a more 

proactive  attitude  towards  exploring  the  potential  of  tourism,  Fernando  gave  an  example  to 

illustrate the passivity of the local population. He reported that there are many complaints about 

how  badly  the  bus  company  operates  inside  Rocinha.  Although  it  is  a  vital  resource  for  the 

transportation of residents and children, people do not get together to fight for their rights. Carlos 

Souza, a local guide, also supports this view. He claimed that it is typical for the Brazilian people 

to complain about something without moving to action. That they are culturally used to blaming a 

third party. It is part of the Brazilian way of life and is present in the Rocinha reality too. As he 

said:”  here  people  don‟t  get  together  to  work  or  to  complain  (…) Whoever  does  not  agree with 

the way tourism is being exploited complains but does not get together to do something about it. 

“  

Besides the influence of the Brazilian culture, the concrete reality of Rocinha also contributes to 

exacerbate  the  lack  of  internal  cooperation.  Hélio  Almeida,  a  member  of  the  local  tourism 

organization, pointed out the fact that because the predominant level of education is low it makes 

it  harder  to  get  the  residents  to  participate  politically  and  actively  about  Rocinhas’  future.  In 

general  there  is  a  lack  of  awareness  whether  in  individual  power  or  even  community  power  to 

make a change. The lack of understanding that people together can work as unit force explains 

why  the  concept  of  association  is  poorly  understood.  According  to  Fernando  Ermiro,  the 

secretary  of  the  local  tourism  organization,  the  community  mentality  looks  at  associations  as 

44 
 

 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
mainly  an  exploitive  mechanism  to  extract  money.  The  residents  are  not  used  to  looking  at 

associations  as  a  form  of  union  but  as  a  way  of  exploiting  others.  As  he  explained:  “there  are 

several associations in Rocinha, for instance, like the moto taxi. Instead of fighting for the right of 

the workers its only role is to demand the association fees. The population is not used to seeing 

associations as a union source (…) that„s why there is no participation, no collective union. There 

is not one single fight for a global interest”.  

The community mentality can explain why the residents that work with tourism do it individually. It 

was  not  possible  to  find  any  kind  of  partnerships  or  collaboration  among  them.  Taking  this 

environment into account once can see how hard it is for a recent organization, like the Tourism 

one, to get local support and participation in order to develop their work. The way of thinking is a 

strong barrier for local involvement. It is so rooted in the community mindset, that it is the cause 

of  internal  conflicts  among  the  members  of  the  local  tourism  association.  There  are  opposite 

views  concerning  their  role  is  never  shared.    As,  once  again  Fernando  Ermiro  (the  secretary) 

explained, in order to improve their action as well as changing the community mentality the first 

step is to promote an internal change. Inside their organization there are members that believe 

that  they  should  charge  a  fee  for  promoting  the  local  projects  and  businesses.  This  argument 

seems  incomprehensible  to  Fernando  who  explained  that  it  does  not  make  sense  to  charge 

someone who is already poor. Plus, if their aim is to strengthen local participation then promotion 

is  part  of  the  strategy.  Although  culture  and  mentality  represent  a  strong  barrier  for  local 

involvement  and  reflects  the  existing  lack  of  internal  cooperation,  there  is  another  factor  that 

blocks local participation. There are conflicts of interest among the different political parties that 

rule Rocinha. Political conflicts are the next issue to be discussed.  

In  Rocinha  the  two  main  representatives  (the  Resident  Association  and  the  Local  Tourism 

Organization)  that  can  influence  tourism  development  are  not  seen  with  positive  eyes  by  the 

residents  that  were  interviewed.  As  to  the  first  one,  it  is  seen  as  an  alienated  actor.  The 

Residents  Association  is  accused  of  not  being  willing  to  include  tourism  affairs  as  part  of  their 

agenda. They are not open to change and evolve as an organization or adjust to the new reality 

of  Rocinha.  As  Rodrigo  a  local  guide  stated  “the  Resident  Association  is  asleep  in  relation  to 

tourism. They don‟t care about it.” The same line of thinking is shared by António Souza another 

guide  “The  Association  does  not  know  how  to  deal  with  this  matter.  They  are  not  interested. 

Tourism brings money but also involves work so they prefer to keep doing what they have always 

been doing”. Furthermore the same interviewee also pointed out corruption as another negative 

aspect about the Resident Association attitude.  

Surprisingly the local tourism organization was not seen as a possible hope in order to improve 

local participation. Several criticisms were made but the main argument is that this organization 

is  mainly  focused  on  getting  their  share  of  the  economic  profits  generated  by  tourism  and  it  is 

quite  disorganized.  Plus  Local  Tourism  Organization  is  seen  as  having  internal  dilemmas.  As 

45 
 

 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
Carlos  Souza,  a  local  guide  explained,  they  don’t  share  the  same  vision  and  have  lack  of 

knowledge.  Concluding  “they  talk  a  lot  but  do  very  little”.  The  president  of  the  Resident 

Association also showed a critical attitude about this initiative, claiming that they don’t have skills 

or knowledge and just want to reap their own benefit through tourism.  

The  members  of  the  Local  Tourism  Organization  also  mentioned  the  role  of  the  Resident 

Association.  The  passivity  of  the  Residents Association  was  also  part  of  the  motivation  to  take 

action and formed this organization. In opposition to what the President claimed, the members of 

this  organization  stated  that  during  the  tourism  development  in  Rocinha  there  was  and  still  is 

dialogue  between  the  agencies  and  the  Residents  Association.  They  accuse  the  Resident 

Association of only being focused on their own political interests neglecting what is best for the 

community  as  a  whole.  In  terms  of  decision  making  there  was  never  any  action  to  be  involved 

and  discuss  with  the  community,  to  get  to  know  what  the  residents  thought  about  it  and  to 

stimulate their awareness. 

Another  obstacle  found  that  constrains  the  spread  of  local  participation  towards  tourism  is  the 

lack of community awareness. Although it was not so obvious as other already discussed factors 

some  locals  mentioned  the  lack  of  residents  understanding.  Such  as  the  local  guide,  Carlos 

Souza,  who  stated:  “the  favela  needs  to  be  more  prepared  for  tourism.  Many  residents  don‟t 

know  how  to  deal  with  it,  what  to  think  about  it  and  why  the  tourists  wants  to  come  here”. 

Increasing  community  understanding  could  possibly  improve  the awareness  about  the potential 

of tourism and how locals could have more access.  

As we can see participation in Rocinha is a very complex issue. Although there are some signs, 

like the small group of residents that work with it or the initiative to form a local organization, it is 

not significant compared with Rocinha’s dimension. In conclusion it was possible to find several 

obstacles from economic, political, social and cultural levels.  

In the case of Pereira da Silva, tourism development is quite different from Rocinha. There is not 

interference  from  external  agencies.  It  was  a  local  initiative  and  it  is  run  locally.    Local 

participation  can  be  seen  as  a  fact  and  not  a  possibility.    The  challenging  regarding  the 

dimension  of  local  involvement  within  this  case  study  is  regarding  the  implementation  process 

and the benefits that the community has access since they became open to tourism.   

At  first  glance,  both  favelas  are  quite  different.  Pereira  da  Silva  is  quite  a  small  place  with  a 

relatively  low  number  of  inhabitants  (around  5.000),  and  a  scarcity  of  resources.  The  local 

economy  is  practically  nonexistent  and  there  are  no  hospitals,  schools  or  kinder  gardens. 

Furthermore  there  is  only  one  NGO  working  in  that  area.  The  environment  of  Pereira  da  Silva 

influences the way tourism is being developed and how the community interacts with it. The first 

impression is that the Pereira da Silva dynamics is far less complex than Rocinha. It is important 

to keep in mind that Rocinha is considered the biggest favela in Latin America with a population 

46 
 

 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
of  around  200.000  inhabitants,  with  a  strong  economy  and  several  NGOs  and  other 

organizations operating there. Despite their differences they share common points, as it is going 

to be revealed further. 

As it was already said the tourism development in Pereira has been based on a local initiative. 

Although  the  fact  that  members  of  a  vulnerable  community  had  the  power  to  initiate  and 

implement tourism activities that does not mean that there is community involvement. In this case 

study, this theme will be analyzed slightly different from the first one. It will start by exposing the 

process  of  decision  making  and  benefits  distribution  of  the  two  actors  (NGO  Morrinho  and 

Hostel). Then it will be presented the elements that can explain why the level of local involvement 

is still low.  

Before discussing the relation of the NGO Morrinho with the community the role of other actors 

that  allowed  this  NGO  to  move  further  will  be  first  explained.  The  NGO  Morrinho  was  the  first 

element responsible to initiate tourism in Pereira da Silva. Nevertheless the support of two other 

organizations  allowed  this  NGO  to  make  this  favela  a  tourism  point.  The  collaboration  of  the 

Resident  Association  was  quite  important  because  it  helped  the  Morrinho  members  with  the 

bureaucratic  process  of  turning  the  house  of  Cilan  (one  of  the  members)  into  the  NGO 

headquarter. Nevertheless it was the partnership with the  enterprise Cama e Café that made it 

possible  to  turn  the  already  casual  visits  into  official  tours.  It  was  during  that  process  that  the 

NGO  Morrinho  together  with  Cama  e  Café  involved  the  community  in  the  decision  making 

process.  With  the  collaboration  of  the  Resident  Association  it  was  possible  to  invoke  the 

residents’ opinion about the possibility of having tourists in their place. Therefore it was the joint 

effort of these three organizations that made it possible to collect several testimonials, especially 

of  those  living  close  to  the  NGO.  It  is  possible  to  say  NGO  Morrinho  considered  local 

participation in the decision making process. In terms of benefit sharing it is harder to evaluate, 

as is going to be explained. 

Although  the  demand  for  tours  is  increasing,  it  is  still  done  in  an  informal  way  and  is  not  a 

systematic  activity.  It  still  happens  occasionally  and  with  low  peaks  during  the  year. 

Consequently, the economic benefits that the NGO Morrinho takes from tourism are still very low. 

In  fact,  the  majority  of  the  NGO  members  work  voluntarily.  Even  Cilan,  who  is  responsible  for 

touring,  does  not  get  any  profit  from  doing  it.  Their  main  economic  source  comes  from  other 

projects that this NGO develops such as film productions and exhibitions. Nevertheless, because 

those  activities  are  not  run  constantly  tourism  is  perceived  as  a  more  consistent  service. 

However,  Morrinho  tours  are  not  yet  a  secure  economic  source  to  rely  on.  Therefore  the 

economic  benefits  that  the  community  can  take  from  it  are  practically  nonexistent,  except  from 

the occasional stopovers at the bar with some tourists after the tour. 

 

47 
 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
In  terms of social  benefits  there  is more clear evidence. Morrinho  is  seen  as  an  active  actor in 

that  community.  Besides  being  the  only  leisure  spot  apart  from  the  football  field,  Morrinho  is 

responsible  for  organizing  cultural  events  for  the  community  such  as  a  jazz  festival  and  open 

cinema sessions. In terms of education they are the only place where teenagers and children can 

improve  their  skills.  During  several  informal  conversations  it  was  possible  to  realise  the 

importance that Morrinho possess inside the community. As a NGO Morrinho provides different 

services.  Nevertheless  for  the  community  Morrinho  is  one  single  unit.  So  the  fact  that  for 

instance, it provides English courses given by international volunteers it is seen as a positive to 

be  benefit  of  tourism.  It  is  understood  to  be  the  way  in  which  Morrinho  contributes  to  the 

community. This interpretation is clear when Evaneide, owner of a small bar, stated when asked 

if the benefits of tourism activities are reinvested in the community:” when it is possible Morrinho 

helps.  As  they  do  with  the  English  courses.  If  they  can  offer  to  the  community  they  will.” 

Interesting, when asked if tourism has a positive economic impact on her business she replied: “I 

would  not  say  that  there  is  an  increase  in  selling  but  the  most  important  thing  is  to  see  new 

faces”. For this resident the social benefits of tourism are more relevant than the economic ones.  

In  general  it  is  possible  to  claim  that  there  are  signs  of  local  participation,  especially  when 

considering the implementation phase by guaranteeing  that residents were in favour of opening 

their favela to tourism. Nevertheless there is no community interaction towards running the tours. 

In terms of benefit sharing, economic profit is not present, not even to Morrinho members. Social 

benefits are clearer since their work seems to be appreciated by the residents and is a motive of 

pride for the community. A strong evidence of the positive effect of Morrinho in Pereira is the fact 

that  their  members  are  seen  as  a  role  model  among  youth  which  justifies  the  fact  that  a  new 

generation of Morinho members is being formed.  

In relation to Hostel Favelinha, although the community didn’t directly participate in the decision 

process,  the  implementation  of  the  hostel  had  a  big  impact  on  the  community.  According  to 

Andreia,  the owner,  her project caused  a negative reaction  among many  residents.  As  Andreia 

stated  “when  I  arrived  here  people  thought  I  was  crazy!”  A  large  part  of  the  community  was 

sceptical  about  it  accusing  her  of  only  being  interested  in  making  money.  Externally,  the 

municipality  was  against  of  the  idea  of  a  hostel  in  a  favela.  They  claim  that  it  was  completely 

incoherent,  that  the  tourists  would  be  in  danger  and  the  house  plan  was  far  too  ambitious.  In 

Andreia  own  words:  “they  thought  I  could  not  build  something  like  this.  Just  because  it‟s  in  a 

favela I can´t build something big and beautiful?! It has to be small and ugly?!”  It is possible to 

see that Andreia idea of opening a hostel in a favela was seen as a revolutionary concept for the 

community and also for the local government.  

In  terms  of  how  the  community  participates  in  the  hostel  business  nowadays,  Andreia  has  an 

informal partnership with a lady that cooks for the tourists and hosts them for lunch in her house. 

Plus when the hostel is full she temporarily hires a girl to work in the reception and to help her 

48 
 

 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
with  cleaning.  Besides,  the  construction  process  and  the  still  existing  repairs  are  in  charge  of 

local  workers.  In  Andreia’s  vision,  the  small  but  existing  residents  participation  is  her  way  of 

being involved with the community. As she stated:  “I have a lot of work and I try to split it. I don‟t 

want  everything  for  myself.  I  feel  happy  to  see  that  I‟m  also  helping  others.  It  is  my  way  of 

interacting  with  the  community”.  Although  on  a  small  scale  and  being  mainly  informal  it  is 

possible  to  see  that  to  a  certain  extent  there  are  some  economic  benefits  reaching  a  few 

community members. 

In terms of social benefits, they were far less visible. Despite her initial idea of opening a Cultural 

house  and  her  complains  about  the  lack  of  social  projects  for  those  tourists  that  wish  to 

contribute, in reality she did not take any action. She argues that she did not continue with her 

project of opening a Cultural house for children because there was no financial support from local 

government and no support from the Resident Association. Currently her only way of contributing 

is by collecting toys from tourists and distributing them to children during Christmas.  

When approaching other residents the role of Morrinho was mentioned for more than the hostel. 

Its contribution to the community was seldom talked about. It is clear that Morrinho is the most 

dominant and active actor in the resident’s perspective. In general the level of awareness about 

participation  in  decision  making  and  distribution  of  benefits  is  low  but  there  is  a  clear 

understanding that tourism was initiated internally and it is explored only by local residents.  

The case of Pereira da Silva can be an example of local tourism initiative in the sphere of favela 

tourism.  Nevertheless,  it  was  possible  to  see  from  the  above  analysis  that  the  level  of  local 

involvement is still precarious. There are signs of local participation in terms of decision making 

in the case of Morrinho and some benefits (especially social ones) are reaching the community. 

Nevertheless  the  distribution  of  benefits  could  be  improved.  At  an  economic  level  the  return  to 

the  community  is  negligible  except  for  the  fact  that  the  hostel  employs  local  people  and  the 

presence of tourists can lead to an increase in the consumption of drinks. Beside the fact that it is 

on a very small scale the economic return only reaches particular elements. The residents that 

live close to the hostel and have good relations with Andreia and the lady of the bar located close 

to both actors are the greatest beneficiaries.  

Although  the  dynamics  found  in  Pereira  da  Silva  were  not  as  complex  as  Rocinha,  it  was  still 

possible  to  find  different  elements  that  according  to  the  main  tourism  actors’  point  of  view 

decrease  the  level  of  community  participation.  Those  factors  are  going  to  be  discussed  in 

advance.   

Andreia, the owner of the hostel, and members of Morrinho are aware that more could be done in 

order to improve the life conditions of the community through their projects. They pointed out that 

one of the barriers of improving local participation is the fact that the community lack initiatives of 

their  own.  They  expressed  their  desire  of  having  a  more  creative  and  active  community.  They 

49 
 

 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
wished  that  their  projects  would  be  seen  as  a  chance  for  residents  to  create  their  own 

opportunities  and  improve  their  access  to  economic  benefits  generated  by  tourism.  As  Andreia 

explained  ”if  the  community  would  be  more  creative,  if  there  would  be  more  people  cooking, 

doing  desserts,  Brazilian  savories  I  would  tell    my  tourists  to  go  there  and  eat  because  it  is 

homemade food!” In the case of Cilan tours there had been occasions of tourists willing to have 

caipirinhas after the initial tour. Cilan took them to a resident house so they could drink it. This 

situation  is  spontaneous  and  not  a  standard  possibility.  If  residents  are  aware  that  there  are 

tourists  circulating  in  the  favela  it  could  be  a  great  opportunity  to  start  and  increase  small 

businesses. For instance one of the existing bars could start selling capirinhas (typical Brazilian 

cocktail)  and  art  craft  stalls  could  be  implemented.  This  favela  is  quite  small  and  the  local 

economy  is  practically  nonexistent  so  a  new  initiative  could  possible  easily  attract  the  tourists 

attention.  

It  is  possible  to  argue  about  the  lack  of  residents’  initiative.  Around  twelve  years  ago  this 

community  was  living  in  a  very  controlled  and  closed  environment.  It  was  not  possible  to  find 

outsiders.  The  human  contact  was  restricted  to  those  that  lived  there.  The  local  economy  was 

even worse than nowadays because it was not common to find people chatting in the street or in 

bars.  At  the  present  time  they  see  new  faces,  tourists  coming  in  and  out  of  their  community. 

Although it is becoming part of their reality and daily routine it is still something new for them, so 

the  perception  that  this  new  environment  can  represent  new  business  opportunities  is  not 

present in their mindset yet.  

Another element that was also evident and is a common feature between the two case studies is 

the lack of internal cooperation. Just as in the case of Rocinha, in Pereira da Silva there are no 

signs of collaboration or any kind of partnerships. The only cooperation that was mentioned was 

the  intervention  of  the  Resident  Association  while  supporting  the  NGO  Morrinho  in  their 

bureaucratic process and in researching residents’ opinion about tourism. In relation to the hostel 

the role of the Resident Association is nonexistent. 

More relevant then that is the fact that the two actors directly related to tourism do not share any 

source of cooperation, greatly reducing the chance of community participation. As Andreia said: 

“If me and Morrinho worked together we could do much more but without a union is not possible.”  

Cilan,  a  member  of  Morrinho,  also  made  it  clear  that  there  it  is  no  partnership  or  any  kind  of 

collaboration with the hostel. He explained that their relationship is based on courtesy because 

they live in the same community. As it is possible to confirm in Cilan’s own words: “I don‟t have 

any partnership with the hostel. Our relation is mainly based on friendship because we are part of 

the  same  community”.  Although  Cilan  receives  tourists  from  the  hostel  there  is  no  link  with  it. 

They work independently. Andreia argues that the price of the tours is an obstacle to cooperating 

with them. As she said: “It is not possible to have a partnership with them because 30 reais (the 

price of the tour) is the price of a bed in my hostel”. 

50 
 

 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
She  moves  on  and  reveals  slightly  how  the  dynamic  among  the  different  actors  in  Pereira  da 

Silva is. It is possible to identity a strong sense of individualism inside the community. There is no 

union spirit and there is a lack of communication among actors. Such evidence becomes clearer 

when Andreia expresses her feelings about the Resident Association “with the association I have 

no  link.  We  are  not  enemies  but  we  are  not  friends  either.  The  Association  here  is  very  small, 

close  and  individual.  It‟s  hard  to  get  in.”    As  we  can  see  although  this  case  is  synonymous  of 

local initiative it is still apparent that tourism development is implemented on an individual scale. 

There is no conscious thought that by working together it would be possible to achieve greater 

development  and  involve  more  locals  in  benefit  sharing.  Even  when  there  is  that  level  of 

awareness as in the case of Andreia, in reality there are no efforts to move in that direction.  

 

5.6.3 Theme 2: Social Dimension 

 

One of the motives of this study is to explore the possible positive effects that tourism can have 

on vulnerable communities. Freire-Medeiros argues that tourism in favela can increase the self-

esteem  of  the  locals,  representing  a  big  achievement.  Additionally,  in  the  literature  related  with 

tourism and poverty there are signs that tourism can promote understanding among tourists and 

dwellers. In order to explore the presence of intangible benefits this dimension will be structured 

based on two concepts: dialogue and self-esteem.  

 

In respect to the first one, this theme will analyze how the encounters with tourists are perceived 

by  the  community  eyes.  In  order  to  do  so,  the  concept  of  “contact  zones”  will  be  used  as  a 

guideline.  As was mentioned in the theoretical chapter, this concept is quite often present in the 

tourism  literature  when  referring  to  the  imbalanced  encounter  of  host  and  guest  due  to  power 

relations that can be connected to a colonial past, gender, political or economic hegemony. The 

second one intends to provide an insight about the community welfare. Therefore, it will use the 

concept  of  self-esteem  as  the main guideline  to discuss  the  impact of  tourism in  residents’ life. 

Other elements linked to the community welfare were found and included in this theme.  

 

In  Rocinha  tourism is seen  as  a gate  to  interact  with  other  cultures. Nevertheless  this option is 

not  always  well  explored  since  there  are  many  complains  concerning  the  way  the  tours  are 

developed. In the condition of resident, anyone can be exposed or affected to tourism regardless 

if it  is  connected  to it  or not,  therefore in  this  section  the  residents are  seen  as  a  whole  so  the 

data  given  by  members  of  organizations  is  not  distinguished  by  the  information  given  by 

residents that are not directly related with tourism. 

Rocinha  residents  in  general saw  the  encounters with  tourists  as  an  opportunity  for interaction, 

cultural  exchange  and  most  importantly  the  chance  to  show  their  history,  their  reality.  As  Helio 

51 
 

 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
Almeida highlighted the interaction with tourists promotes: “demystification from the outside eyes 

about what a favela is” and “the interesting thing of tourism is to have an exchange. The tourist 

gets to know the community and the community gets to know him”  by Fernando Ermir. Despite 

the  positive  opinion  about  what  contact  with  tourists  can  promote,  in  reality  there  are  many 

concerns about the current tourism situation.  

Criticisms are made about how the tours are organized. It is seen as a commercial activity and 

does  not  allow  interaction  between  tourists  and  locals.  The  main  reason  pointed  out  for  the 

discomfort  with  the  way  it  is  being  planned  is  because  the  guides  are  outsiders  who  have, 

according  to  locals,  no  idea  about  their  reality  and  their  history.  As  was  clearly  expressed  in 

Eduardo  Casais,  a  local  journalist,  opinion:  ”I  think  it  is  very  inappropriate  to  have  an  external 

agency coming inside and showing a reality that they don‟t know.”  

He moves on in his argument to claim that “for instance the guide will show that there is a large 

accumulation of garbage. But why there is so much garbage? It‟s because the municipality can‟t 

manage it. Plus because it is a favela the trash collector passes less often. Furthermore resident 

also  do  not  have  the  consciousness  to  not  add  more  garbage  in  an  area  that  is  already  full”. 

Since  the  context  is  missing  the  consequence  is  disconnection  between  what  tourists  see  and 

the reasons underneath. Because this link is not present receiving tourists can have a negative 

impact  on  the  residents.  As  Eduardo  pointed:”  as  a  resident  my  image  is  distorted  by  tourism. 

Then they will go back to their countries and say it is all wrong. The resident image is harmed”. 

There are other residents that share the notion that if the encounter between tourists and locals 

is  not  well  balanced  by  the  guide  the  consequences  can  be  negative  and  it  will  be  mainly 

affecting the favela dwellers. As Daniel, director of a local NGO, claimed: “I have heard many lies 

about  Rocinha  from  external  guides.  Then  the  tourists  look  at  Rocinha  according  to  what  they 

hear.  Sometimes  I  pass  by  and  say:  hey  what  your  guide  is  telling  you  is  a  lie!”  As  a 

consequence,  it  is  frequent  to  hear  residents  expressing  their  desire  of  having  local  guides 

instead  who  they  believe  are  more  familiar  with  the  place  and  would  be  responsible  for  telling 

their  side  of  the  story.  Some  think  that  the  contact  with  tourists  made  by  external  elements 

increases the feeling of being locked as at exotic commodity, as Hélio de Almeida expressed:” I 

think  that  the  tourists  found  us  exotic.  The  fact  that  the  agency  and  guide  are  from  outside 

contributes to that. ”  

Nevertheless,  Eduardo  Casais  although  thinks  that  the  best  option  is  not  to  have  alienated 

external agencies operating in Rocinha, believes that the solution might not be only in hiring local 

people to do the tours. As he stated: “it is not because you are a resident that you are prepared 

to be a guide. The majority of the knowledge that I know is because I worked on a website that 

collected  stories  of  elderly  residents.  It  is  not  because  you  were  born  here  that  you  know  it.  It 

should be planned better so as to prepare those people”. 

 

52 
 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
On  the  other  hand,  the  local  guides  defend  their  role  by  assuming  a  distinguished  position 

compared to the way the agencies operate. As Carlos Souza, a local guide, said:” the agencies 

are not interested in quality, in showing the history of Rocinha to the tourists. They do not even 

know  about  it.  They  tell  a  lot  of  lies  and  the  tourists  get  to  know  very  little  about  the  favela. 

Besides they rarely walk on the street”.  

All  the  guides  interviewed  share  the  same  vision  about  the  potential  of  their  tours.  They  all 

support  doing  only  walking  tours,  but  when  necessary  to  use  the  local means  of  transportation 

(moto  taxi),  try  to  show  social  projects,  schools  and  provide  an  experience  closer  to  Rocinha 

reality. As Rodrigo explained: “if you take a tour with a local  you will have a different experience. 

When  I  take  a  tourist  inside  a  house  they  are  surprised  to  see  a  computer,  tv,  hot  water.  An 

agency  does  not  have  the  chance  to  show  you  this”.  In  their  dialogues  it  was  also  possible  to 

identify the desire to show tourists that the majority of the people that live in Rocinha are honest 

and hard workers. As Zezinho said: “I want to show that the reality here is the opposite of what 

the media shows that it is possible to walk peacefully, without problems that the majority of the 

residents are honest people and just because a minority is connected with trafficking the whole 

community gets a bad reputation. I try, on my tour, show the tourists how different It really is from 

what is being said.” The same line of thought is present in the discourse of Carlos Sousa: “what I 

try to show to my tourists is that there are a lot of honest working people...very different   from 

what the media portrays”.  

It is clear that as slum dwellers they are quite aware of the strong prejudice that surrounds the 

favela  and  its  people.  It  is  this  awareness  that  justifies  their  urge  of  using  the  encounter  with 

tourists to express their identity, to show their side of the story. Furthermore, this opportunity also 

represents  a  chance  to  reinforce  the  sense  of  Rocinha  singularity  as  Carlos  Souza  explained: 

“Before starting my tour I like to explain what a favela is and the different types that you can find 

in Rio. There are differences between favelas in the south and north area of the city. I think this 

helps them to understand better what they are going to see and to acknowledge that each favela 

is unique”. 

It  is  possible  to  discuss  about  the  importance  of  transmitting  the  sense  of  uniqueness.  Rio  de 

Janeiro has more than eight hundred favelas. Media, government and even research has been 

portraying  favelas  as  a  homogenous  reality,  emitting  differences  among  them.    As  it  was 

mentioned in the theoretical chapter, Valladares pointed out this situation in her book referring to 

it as one of the dogmas about favelas.  

Despite the dissatisfaction about the way the encounters between tourists and locals are being 

promoted,  it  is  also  possible  to  find  positive  signs  as  a  consequence  of  the  interaction  with 

tourists.  In  this  sense,  it  is  necessary  to  recall  Rodrigo  Carvalho,  a  young  local  guide.  He 

explained that at the age of fifteen when Rocinha began to experience tourists circulating around 

 

53 
 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
it was quite strange for him to see people with a different physiognomy:”  I found it strange that 

they  were  white,  blonde,  speaking  a  language  that  I  could  not  understand  and  wondered  why 

they were here.” The continuous presence of tourists opens a path for residents like him to come 

into  contact  with  different  cultures  and  to  develop  a  new  social  network.  As  Rodrigo  Carvalho 

explained:  “when  Rocinha  became  touristic  things  changed  so  much  that  now  people  from  the 

favela have friends that do not live in the favela, like the tourists. They become your friends, your 

neighbor.  They  come  to  Brazil  but  want  to  live  in  Rocinha.”  According  to  Rodrigo  Carvalho  the 

presence of tourists led to the unexpected rise of a niche market in Rocinha: renting houses or 

rooms  to  foreigners.  The  possibility  of  communicating  with  people  from  a  completely  different 

cultural background in a less rigid and formal way such as neighbors or roommates can have a 

positive impact on a slum dweller, as we can see by Rodrigo example:” tourism changed my life 

a lot. It gave me the opportunity to meet people from different countries, motivation to learn new 

languages  and  helped  me  to  change  the  way  I  was  thinking.  Before  I  was  thinking  about  the 

wrong stuff... I could only see till a certain point. Now I can see beyond.” 

Rodrigo’s  optimistic  vision  about  what  encounters  with  tourists  can  bring  is  also  shared  by 

Rogério Pinto, coordinator of a local NGO. He also mentioned the growing tendency of foreigners 

to choose Rocinha as their temporary residence. Plus he highlighted the fact that the possibility 

of  contact  with  tourists,  foreigners  is  positive  because  some  time  ago  that  was  something 

impossible  to  experience.  Finally  he  mentioned  the  consequences  that  it  can  have  on  the 

younger  generations,  as  he  claimed:”  this  contact  is  particularly  good  for  the  youth  as  they 

become more motivated to learn new languages and they have the chance to come into contact 

with different cultures. It opens their mind.” 

To  sum  up,  the  encounter  with  tourists  in  Rocinha  can  have  asymmetric  contours  especially 

when  referring  to  the  way  agencies  and  in  particular  external  guides  block  interactional 

opportunities and present the favela. Plus it was possible to see the imbalanced power relations 

that  are beneath.  The locals’  voice is  shadowed  by  the  agencies  that seem not  to  be  aware  or 

are not interested in promoting a type of tour that would suit better the residents’ expectations. 

As  a  consequence  the  local  guides  are  engaged  in  doing  a  tour  in  a  different  format.  It  was 

possible to understand that in the condition of favela dwellers the guides are aware of the stigma 

that comes with living in a favela. Therefore they use tourism as a means of telling their side of 

the story. This aspect will be further explored in detail in another theme. It is only mentioned here 

to  superficially  explain  why  local  guides  are  engaged  in  distinguishing  themselves  from  the 

external agencies.  

Although the interaction with tourists is not always carried out in the most advantageous way we 

can see that there are signs of positive effects of meeting two different cultures. The friendship 

link  or  the  status  of  neighbour  allows  for  a  less  rigid  interaction.  The  key  element  is  not  the 

difference between the two actors but in what format those contacts are made. It is the last factor 

54 
 

 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
that  can  improve  the  communication  and  the  positive  consequences  that  can  come  with  in 

bringing together slum dwellers and foreign people. 

As  we  can  see,  tourism  in  Rocinha  raises  antagonist  feelings.  Despite  the  controversy  of 

transforming favelas into tourism commodities it is possible to find evidences that the introduction 

of  tourism  can  bring  positive  signs  into  the  community’s  life.  There  are  residents  that  have  a 

positive  attitude  about  having  tourists  in  their  neighbourhood  and  express  it  by  mentioning  the 

evolution  of  Rocinha  and  the  aroused  feelings  caused  by  this  new  reality.  It  is  important  to 

highlight that locals that are not connected with tourism share this vision as can be illustrated by 

António  Paiva,  who  works  outside  Rocinha  in  the  construction  field:    “I  think  it  is  very  good.  It 

gives  me  tranquility,  freedom.  Before  there  were  people  with  shotguns  controlling  who  was 

coming in and who was living. Today the idea of seeing tourists coming into the favela gives me 

a peaceful feeling.”   

The notion of security that tourism might transmit, even if not realistic is a very precious value for 

someone  that  lives  in  on  area  of  conflict  like  in  the  case  of  a  favela  controlled  by  the  parallel 

power.  It  important  not  to  forget  that  Rocinha  is  still  under  the  control  of  the  gang,  Amigo  dos 

Amigos and it is a very profitable drug selling point. Therefore it is quite understandable that the 

sense  of  peace  that  might  come  along  with  tourism  is  so  much  appreciated.  Rogério  Pinto,  a 

member of a local NGO also said:” I think it helps to reduce barriers and gives a higher sense of 

security.” Other residents also shared some good thoughts about having tourists as the case of 

Leandro, a moto taxi driver:” we feel proud of having people that come from so far and wants to 

know about the place where we live.”  

Among  the  residents  connected  with  tourism  it  was  also  possible  to  find  a  good  level  of 

awareness about the opportunity of positive effects in the community through tourism. Fernando 

Ermir, secretary of the local tourism organization, believes that tourism in Rocinha can lead to a 

change in people’s behaviour in the long term. It can motivate them to learn more, to get more 

education. In the short term, well implemented tourism can increase the community self-esteem. 

As he said: ”just  the fact that you came so far to visit me, to get to know the place where I live is 

quite  good  for  me”    Furthermore,  he  reveals  that  he  believes  that  the  majority  of  the  residents 

appreciate having tourists. He says that the fact that there are people who are willing to visit the 

place where they live is highly valued. He explains that it is interpreted as: “a sign of pride. That 

at the end the place where they live is not so bad. “Plus he states that: ”tourism can offer a great 

opportunity to promote the community, create interaction among people from different cultures”. 

He  also  pointed  out  possible  consequences  to  younger  generations  such  as  the  motivation  to 

learn  English  and  even  start  small  business.  Finally,  he  mentioned  that  the  dissatisfaction  that 

can be presented while discussing the topic of tourism is not about tourism itself but the way it 

has been implemented.  

 

55 
 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
As was said before, favelas are socially apart from the rest of the city and favelados have a poor 

image in the Brazilian society, especially among higher classes. One can say that an individual 

who  has  to  live  with  this  burden  will  probably  have  low  self-esteem  and  a  poor  self-image.  In 

order to illustrate this idea it is necessary to mention Helio Almeida, member of the local tourism 

organization. He stated that tourism has an impact on self-esteem because:” you think that the 

place  where  you  live  is  not  so  bad”.  Plus:  ”because  it  is  not  just  the  outside  has  a  negative 

image. Quite often the residents also have a negative image about the place that they live. About 

the amount of garbage in the street, that there are only people with a low level of education living 

here,  that  it  is  very  crowed  and  messy.  This  way  is  easier  for  the  resident  to  understand  that 

those elements are part of his culture and is appreciated by others.”  

As  we  can  see  although  tourism  can  represent  mixed  feelings  due  to  the  reasons  already 

explained it is still possible to find evidences of the positive effects, such as the increase of self-

esteem. Furthermore it is crucial to refer to the association of tourism with freedom and progress. 

Despite  the  tense  environment  that  still  exists  in  Rocinha  tourism  can  diminish  that  which 

represents a very important achievement and a strong argument to accentuate the importance of 

the social dimension of favela tourism.  

In  the  case  of  Pereira  da  Silva  the  encounter  with  tourists  is  seen  as  a  positive  opportunity.  In 

opposition to Rocinha it was not possible to find criticisms about the way tours are organized or 

how  people  feel  that  tourism  can  contribute  to  reinforce  a  negative  image.  It  is  possible  to 

speculate that the fact that it is locally run and has a low frequency reduces the chance of locals 

feeling too exposed or misunderstood. In order to sustain this perspective it is necessary to refer 

to Jorgete, a 54 years old resident. She described the interaction with tourists as quite smooth, 

easy  and  spontaneous.  She  claims  that  she  often  helps  them  with  the  luggage,  directions  and 

sometimes  has  a  few  drinks  with  them  in  a  bar  close  to  the  hostel.  Furthermore  she  also 

highlighted that in order to promote a positive interaction the community should be aware of how 

to  host  and  deal  with  the  tourists.  According  to  her  perspective  it  is  the  communities’ 

responsibility  of  balancing  the  interface  with  the  tourists.  Moreover  Jorgete  expresses  that  the 

contact with tourists can promote an improvement in the daily life of the community. As she said: 

“I think it is good for the community. It brings improvement. Here we only know each other so it is 

very good to have the chance to meet people from outside. It‟s very important to deal with other 

people  and  with  different  cultures.”  Jorgete  also  highlights  that  it  is  a  giving  back  situation 

because  there  are  other  communities  that  would  not  accept  the  presence  of  tourists.  As  she 

stated: ”it is not every community that accepts it. Here you can walk around without any problem. 

You will not see anything wrong. But there are many communities where you cannot walk alone. 

You have to know where to go, who to talk to and your entrance and exit time is controlled.”  

Once again the need to express the singularity of their favela is present. In fact this feeling can 

also be identified among other references, like the case of Andreia. When mentioning the reality 

56 
 

 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
of Pereira da Silva, Andreia contested that: “for me this is not a favela. Here there is no violence 

and  no  one  starves.”    Also  in  Pereira  da  Silva  is  possible  to  find  foreigners  living  in  the  favela 

which helps to promote communication on more equal terms.  

In informal conversations during my time spent as a volunteer, I realized the importance of those 

encounters as a way of showing that favelas are also an integral element of the Brazilian culture 

and  therefore  should  be  celebrated.  This  argument  is  clear  in  Maiara,  (who  works  in  a  bar) 

statement: “In order to say you know Brazil and particularly Rio you must visit the favelas. Only 

Christ Redeemer is not enough”.  

The  fact  that  receiving  tourists  offers  locals  the  possibility  of  contacting  and  seeing  different 

people from their usual routine is also quite valued. The chance to speak English and exchange 

ideas is very much appreciated. As the same participant explained she enjoys talking to tourists 

because, in opposition to the majority of the youth there, they share the same music preferences. 

Children  and  teenagers  also  appreciate  having  tourists  around  and  the  possibility  of 

communicating  with  them  represents one  of  the main motivations  to  follow  the English courses 

provided by Morrinho.  

Speculations can be made about the reason that can somehow justify a positive feedback from 

the community. In Pereira da Silva, the tourism development is locally run. There are no conflicts 

with external agencies or guides. Compared to Rocinha, tourism activities are run in an informal 

and  less  commercial  way.  Since  the  tours  do  not  happen  on  a  regular  basis  there  is  a  more 

limited likelihood that the presence of tourists will interfere in the daily routine of the residents. As 

shown in the research frequency, size of the groups and tour methods are an important factor. 

Due to its nature (the tourists go there for accommodation and to see an art exhibition) and the 

fact that it is done on foot and with small groups can justify why from the community perspective, 

the contact between tourists and residents have not yet reached a saturation point.  

Furthermore, is important to highlight the fact that Pereira da Silva, in opposition to Rocinha, is 

quite a small community, which transmits a more familiar feeling. There are only two bars and a 

grocery  shop  which  makes  encounters  between  tourists  and  residents  almost  impossible  to 

avoid.  Since  the  local  business  is  practically  nonexistent  it  opens  space  for  more  informal  and 

spontaneous  contact  situations.  For  instance,  the  fact  that  Andreia  often  indicates  some 

neighbours’ houses for the tourists that want to have lunch, have caipirinhas or snacks promotes 

a  more  familiar  interaction.  As  well  as  this,  when  there  are  barbecues  and  funk  parties  the 

tourists are also invited to join.  

In Pereira da Silva it was also present the psychological positive effect associated to tourism. In 

fact, it is the social impact of tourism rather the economic benefit that makes this community be 

open to it.  

 

57 
 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
The  correlation  between  self-esteem  and  tourism  goes  beyond  evidences  found  inside  the 

community. While talking with members of the Cama e Café entrepreneurship João Vergara (the 

director) and Daniela Greco (responsible for the collaboration with Morrinho) they mentioned the 

opportunity to interact with different people and self-esteem as the main current contributions of 

tourism  in  Pereira  da  Silva.  Nevertheless,  while  approaching  residents  that  are  not  directly 

involved in the tourism activities, although positive effects of tourism were mentioned, instead of 

self-image they referred to their external image. The way they are perceived by outsiders could 

be  improved  by  tourism.  This  finding  is  evident  in  the  conversation  with  Evaneide,  who  runs  a 

bar. She claims that: “Tourism gives a good image of the community. Those who visit spread the 

word  to  others.”  And  also  in  Maiara  (that  works  in  another  bar)  who  stated:  “There  is  always 

something good in every place [… ] tourism is a good way to promote the good things that exist  

here.” 

The  same  interviewee  also  pointed  out  the  sense  of  pride  that  having  tourism  transmits  to  the 

community. Since she works in the bar that is located in the main street, and also quite close to 

Morrinho and Hostel, it is frequently a gathering point for locals and tourists. She said that often a 

boy that works for the hostel comes there and tells a lot of stories about the tourists to the rest of 

the customers. He feels proud that tourists come here and some residents share his vision too.  

Among  other  residents  it  was  possible  to  observe,  once  again,  the  association  of  tourism  with 

achievement. It is seen as a step further for community development and a sign of freedom. As 

Jorgete,  an  unemployed  resident,  explained:”  I  think  tourism  is  good  for  us.  It  is  a  sign  of 

evolution. It‟s an improvement. Here we have freedom and that is very nice.”  If we look back at 

how this community was in the past and how it is now it is quite understandable that tourism is 

interpreted  as a  sign  of evolution.    During  the  60/70s  Pereira  da Silva  lifestyle  was similar to  a 

farm.  The  residents  were  a  small  group  with  strong  to  each  other.  The  living  conditions  were 

more precarious but they had many fruit trees and small gardens to sustain their livelihood. In the 

80s/90s the reality changed dramatically.  

Besides the expansion and the decrease of social link among residents, Pereira became a quite 

popular drug selling point and a very violent place. This environment lasted until recently. For a 

better  understanding  of  the  changes  that  Pereira  da  Silva  has  gone  through  it  is  important  to 

evoke  Cilan´s  (member  of  NGO  Morrinho)  conversation.  He  said  that  he  believes  that  the 

community has changed a lot and not only regarding tourism. He claimed that twelve years ago 

they  were  living  in  a  very  restricted  environment  under  strict  rules.  Their  behaviour  was  highly 

controlled. They could not exit the favela freely and outsiders were not allowed. Now it is possible 

to see tourists circulating alone in the favela.  Taking into to account the context, today’s Pereira 

da Silva reality is definitely a sign of improvement and progress.  

 

58 
 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
The evolution that is reflected in Pereira da Silva as a whole it is also present in Cilan’s vision of 

himself.  As  we  can  see  from  his  statement:  “I  have  changed  a  lot.  I  was  nothing  to  what  I  am 

now. Twenty seven years of life twelve of change. Thank God I have changed a lot. I have lost a 

big part  of  the  rebellion  that  I  had  twelve  years ago.  I  have learned how  to communicate  more 

with the help of the outside boys (the two film directors that are part of the formation of Morrinho 

NGO) that made part of the project. Besides, because I started learning new things, how to deal 

with technology I started to feel better with myself. I gained more self-respect. I became able to 

look and talk to people, to have more dignified behaviour and to have more respect for my work.” 

Although  it  is  not  directly  referring  to  tourism  the  great  benefits  of  contact  with  external  people 

and learning skills that are not part of the favela culture or environment ( like how to use a video 

camera,  do  film  editing,  shooting  and  other  video  production  related  activities)  is  quite  evident. 

Despite  the  fact  that  Cilan  story  is  quite  a  unique  example,  it  opens  a  path  for  reflecting  that 

tourism  (a  new  activity  in  the  favelas  reality)  comes  with  the  chance  of  communicating  with 

different  people.  The  fact  that  some  residents  through  tourism,  can  contact  outsiders,  develop 

new  skills  or  have  a  different  job  opportunity  can  indeed  have  an  impact  on  the  residents´ 

mentality  and  in  their  inner vision.  It  can  change  the  perception  of  who  they  are  and  what  they 

can achieve as human beings. 

 

5.6.4 Theme 3: Tourism (Transmodern) Potential and Local 

Aspirations 

 

As was mentioned in the theoretical chapter, this research aims to understand if favela tourism 

can contribute to initiate a social transformation of favela dwellers. In order to address that it is 

fundamental  to  understand  if  tourism  developments  conform  with  the  residents  aspirations  of 

what  tourism  represents  for  them.  The  concept  beneath  this  theme  is  perception  and  this 

subsection regards exclusively the perspective of locals concerning the potential of tourism. It will 

be  possible  to  see,  through  this  theme,  to  what  extent  the  residents’  vision  is  similar  to  their 

existing reality.  

In  the  case  of  Rocinha,  as  was  shown  in  the  previous  theme,  tourism  does  represent  a  good 

opportunity  for locals  and  it  is  seen  with  positive  eyes.  Nevertheless  the main  dissatisfaction  in 

relation to today tourism in Rocinha is related with the low number of locals involved. Despite the 

obvious  consequence  of  increasing  the  amount  of  residents  in  obtaining  economic  benefits 

through  tourism,  they  assume  that  hiring  external  people  to  introduce  Rocinha  to  tourists 

increases  the  gap  between  the  guide´s  performance  and  the  existing  reality.  There  is  much 

criticism  about  how  guides  do  their  work.  Accusations  are  made  in  relation  to  the  lack  of 

knowledge and engagement towards Rocinha.  

59 
 

 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
Hélio Almeida, member of the local tourism organization, criticizes today’s tourism saying that it 

is  carried  out  in  a  very  superficial  way  preventing  tourists  from  getting  to  know  the  history  of 

Rocinha.  Carlos  Souza,  local  guide,  pointed  out  the  lack  of  engagement  of  travel  agencies  in 

doing tours to promote a real insight into Rocinha.  

As  we  can  see  the  need  to  promote  their  history,  to  protect  and  proclaim  their  identity  justifies 

why  it  was  possible  to  find  several  criticisms  concerning  the  presence  of  external  elements  in 

exploring the tourism side of Rocinha. This desire also reflects what locals aspire from tourism. 

As  Hélio  Almeida  said:  “through  tourism  we  have  the  possibility  to  create  an  image  from  the 

inside  to  the  outside”.  The  idea  that  tourism  can  be  a  base  from  which  to  construct  a  different 

image is present in the mindset of many residents. Daniel can be a good example. He believes 

that tourism is the opportunity to break the image that a favela is a dangerous place and favela 

people  are  very  different  from  the  rest  of  the  citizens.  According  to  Daniel,  if  tourists  had  the 

chance to walk around the favela they could see that normal people lived there.  

Zezinho,  a  local  guide,  is  another  resident  that  shares  this  common  view.  As  he  explained, 

tourism in his opinion is an opportunity to show that in opposition to what the media publish it is 

possible  to  walk  around  peacefully.  In  addition  he  also  mentioned  the  strong  prejudice 

concerning favela  dwellers.  As he said:”  the  largest  portion  of  residents is honest hard working 

people.  Because  of  a  small  percentage  that  is  connected  with  trafficking  the  whole  community 

gets  a  bad  reputation.”  In  his  vision  tourism  can  break  that  outlook  and  that  is  what  he intends 

with  his  tours.  He  wants  to  show  that  Rocinha  can  be  very  different  from  the  image  portrayed. 

The same interviewee also mentioned that because of the reputation of movies like the “City of 

God “ there are tourists that do the tours willing to see people carrying guns, the opposite of what 

he aims to show. It is possible to reflect upon the promotion made by movies and other sources 

present  in  the  theoretical  chapter.  Although  it  was  the  trigger  to  restart  the  fascination  over 

favelas, in terms of tourism it can work in a double way. It attracts tourists but it can also portray 

the same negative image. 

The vision of using tourism to spread the idea that Rocinha can be different from what the media 

and  Brazilian  middle  class  believe  being  a  common  link  among  local  guides  and  their  need  to 

distinguish  themselves  from  external  agencies  were  already  reflected  in  the  previous  theme. 

Nevertheless,  it  was  mentioned  briefly  in  this  one  because  it  reinforces  the  perspective  that 

locals have about tourism.  

Other relevant information that must be mentioned is the fact that for some, like the local guide 

Toninho tourism can be a way to attenuate the dominant sociocentric view of higher classes in 

relation to favela dwellers. In his mind, tourism can be a way of opening the door to high class 

Brazilians  enabling  them  to  get  to  know  favelas  and  their  people.  He  expressed  his  desire  to 

attract more Brazilians explaining that in 20 years of work he had only got 40 Brazilians, mainly 

 

60 
 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
all from the southern area of the country. As it was explained before, the prejudice in relation to 

favelados  is  very  strong  but  geographically,  rich  and  poor  people  live  side  by  side  in  Rio  de 

Janeiro  which  justifies  Toninho’s  statement:  “I  would  like  to  take  rich  Brazilians  to  get  to  know 

their neighbours”. Fernando Ermiro, secretary of the local tourism organization, shares the same 

desire. He explained that he would like to attract Brazilians to see Rocinha.  

He justified that due to the extreme prejudice people that live in Gavea (the rich neighbourhood 

where Rocinha is located) never entered the favela because of the news related with trafficking 

and violence. To sum up, he believes that tourism could be the opportunity to show that there are 

honest people living in the favela as well.  

Although  tourism  represents  a  good  opportunity  for  residents  and  the  presence  of  tourists  is 

appreciated,  as  it  was  revealed  before,  locals  have  shown  dissatisfaction  concerning  the  way 

tourism  is  being  developed.  Since  their  aspirations  do  not  match  the  existing  reality,  several 

residents expressed negative feelings in relation to tourism. The most common ones are: feeling 

exploited and invaded. Such information can be confirmed by the statement of Daniel, who works 

in an NGO:  “ when I see a group of 20/30 people I think it is strange and disrespectful to be able 

to take pictures without asking for permission”.  Fernando Ermiro, also confirmed that there are 

critiques  concerning  the  habit of  taking  pictures  without permission. He  explained  that  although 

there are residents that do not agree with this behaviour they do not express themselves. Once 

again the community mindset is present and explains partially the residents’ behaviour. Although 

it was possible to find criticism in relation to tourism they all attribute responsibility to the guides 

and not to the tourists. Perhaps it is because of the negative emotions associated to tourism that 

almost  all  the  residents mentioned  the  importance  of hiring local people.  Possibly,  they  believe 

that residents would feel more engaged since they are part of the community as well. More easily 

tourism could be used to show the positive side of Rocinha and disrespectful attitudes towards 

the community would be attenuated.  

To  finalize,  when  residents  had  a  chance  to  project  their  vision  of  how  tourism  should  be 

developed in Rocinha the dominant perspective highlights the importance of giving more control 

to locals, to increasing the amount of residents involved with tourism, to reducing or to balancing 

the power of external travel agencies and to giving more preparation to those residents that work 

or  are  willing  to  work  with  tourism.  In  that  respect  the  organization  of  courses  about  Rocinha 

history and English classes were mentioned. 

In  regard  to  this  theme,  concerning  the  case  of  Rocinha,  it  is  possible  to  see  the  imbalance 

between  the  perceptions  of  locals  concerning  tourism  and  how  in  reality  it  is  being  developed. 

The  dissatisfaction  and  the  lack  of  power  to  change  this  situation  can  lead  to  exploitation  and 

disempowerment.  In  that  case,  favela  tourism  despite  its  potential  can  cause  more  harm  than 

positive effects on the community. If this scenario can be proved as real then the idealistic vision 

 

61 
 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
that tourism in disadvantaged areas can represent a way to integrate excluded communities and 

increase their self-esteem can be questionable.  

In  opposition,  the  case  of  Pereira  da  Silva  exposes  a  more  harmonious  relation  between  local 

aspirations and the way tourism is being developed. In this way, in general residents believe that 

tourism  is  a  way  to  reveal  the  good  side  of  favelas  and  to  create  a  new  image,  different  from 

what  is  seen  in  the  media.  As  Maiara,  who  works  in  a  bar,  said:”  There  are  good  things 

everywhere.  It  is  important  to  spread  them.”  Furthermore,  Francisco  Silva,  member  of  NGO 

Morrinho, believes that tourism can be a possibility to transform favelas into social places and to 

reduce the prejudice that people outside the favela have about favelas. His point of view can be 

confirmed by his statement:” tourism can be an opportunity to show that there are good citizens 

living  here,  that  it  is  not  exclusively  a  place  where  gangsters  live  like  many  people  think“.  In 

addition, Francisco also mentioned the fact that tourism in Pereira da Silva can lead to a better 

outlook of the community towards foreigners. It is important to notice that the positive impact of 

tourism outside the favela walls is only regarding the international sphere. In fact, when Morrinho 

members or Andreia (the hostel owner) were asked about the presence of Brazilian tourists the 

answer was always the same: never had or only very few dare to do it.  Andreia statement:” if I 

had to depend on Brazilians I would starve” illustrates how rare the presence is of the Brazilian 

public in this new form of tourism in Rio de Janeiro. 

Since  in  this  case  study  tourism  was  implemented  by  locals  I  wanted  to  understand  how  they 

perceived  tourism,  how  they  interpreted  their  reality  and  if  their  projects  were  in  harmony  with 

their vision. In several informal conversations with Andreia (the hostel owner) and Cilan (member 

of NGO Morrinho and the initiator of the artistic scale model) they revealed being aware of how 

their world, as slum dwellers, is shaped by the media at a national and international level. As was 

explained  in  the  background  chapter,  media  was  a  key  element  in  creating  strong  negative 

assumptions  in  the  public  opinion  about  the  favela  and  its  people  since  the  eradication  period. 

However  nowadays  as  a  consequence  of  a  highly  interconnected  society  they  face  similar 

judgment  at  an  international  scale.  In  fact,  this  awareness  was  part  of  Andreia  motivation  in 

opening her business, as she stated: “I wanted to show that not everybody that lives in a favela is 

a thief. Here you can find good people, normal human beings. I wanted to show to my American 

and European  tourists  that  it  is  possible  to live  in a  peaceful  community  that  it  is  different  from 

what  you  can  find  in  newspapers and  on  television.  Even  today  in  Europe  the  media  mentions 
the  slaughter  of  Candelaria9.  When  international  media  wants  to  criticize  Rio  they  only  show 

blood and guns. The favela is not like that. I wanted to show my tourists that it can be different 

                                                             
9 This slaughter happened on 23rd July 1993 in front of the church with the name Candelaria in the city 
center.  It was carried out by a group of police men that shot into a group of sixty homeless kids and 
teenagers  that  were  sleeping  on  the  church  steps.  It  caused  the  death  of  six  children  and  two 
teenagers.

from what they think”.  Following the reflection about their positionality as slum dwellers and the 

role of their projects, Cilan highlighted that: ” the tour helps to change the mentality. At least the 

tourists can say that here they were welcome. Here they saw creativity and positive things.” 

Besides  the  strong  prejudice  concerning  the  favela  and  its  people,  Cilan  is  also  aware  of  the 

social and geographical separation between the favela and the rest of the society. He invokes a 

mind-set change. He criticizes openly how Brazilian society is socially segregated. How the two 

worlds, favela and the “asphalt”, live apart. Cilan aspires to a more united society, where people 

from  different  cultural  and  social  backgrounds  could  interact  and  learn  from  each  other.  His 

biggest  accomplishment  is  that  the  work  developed  by  the  NGO  Morrinho  tries  to  break  that 

barrier  creating  a  space  for  such  interaction.  As  he  says:  “here  you  can  find  people  from  the 

favela, people from outside and from other countries. Everybody in the same place. Society as a 

whole.” This interconnection is the biggest pride of Cilan and it is a rare achievement in a society 

with such a strong class division like Rio de Janeiro. 

As we can see, both participants share the perception of how their reality and consequently how 

themselves, as slum dwellers, are represented in a global scale by the media. Their awareness 

is  a  fundamental  ingredient  in  their  commitment  of  contributing  with  their  work  to  taking  a  step 

further in changing the negative perception upon favelas. 

The phenomenon of favela tourism was also discussed and they revealed the fact of being aware 

of the controversy attached to this recent trend in Rio.  Andreia shows quite a negative opinion 

about it, labelling the tourism development in Rocinha as “disgusting” mentioning similarities with 

a Zoo due to the exposition of the community to the tourists’ cameras. It is important to explain 

that  once  the  topic  of  favela  tourism  is  mentioned  the  association  with  Rocinha  is  automatic 

because since it was the first tourist favela and the most popular one it is seen as the symbol of 

favela tourism in Rio de Janeiro. 

In  addition  she  also  mentioned  the  a  past  occasion  where  photos  of  tourists  with  a  drug  lord 

appeared on  the  television  as  an  illustration  of how  negative  this form of  tourism  can be.  Cilan 

was  less  negative  about  it  but  showed  that  he  is  aware  of  the  prejudice  that  exists  about  the 

tourism  development  in  favelas.  In  the  theoretical  chapter  the  researcher  Freire-Medeiros 

highlighted the fact that favela tourism was a highly polemic and contested topic in the Brazilian 

society.  Andreia and Cilan are aware of it and also partially reflect the negative vision that favela 

tourism can have in the public opinion.  

In opposition to Rocinha, in this case study it was not possible to find negative feelings due to the 

presence of tourism. Due to the low frequency and the fact that it is locally run one may say that, 

perhaps, the moral commitment that Andreia has towards the community might also contribute. 

She  explained  that  she  is  aware  that  the  presence  of  tourists  can  put  residents  in  an 

uncomfortable position,  feeling  too  exposed.  Because  of  that  Andreia  controls  the  behaviour of 

63 
 

 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
the tourists that choose to stay at her hostel. One of her main concerns is the excess of pictures 

and  especially  taken  without  permission.  As  she  stated:”here  is  not  a  zoo!”  In  order  to  keep  a 

respectful environment between tourists and residents Andreia says that she does not hesitate to 

send  them  away  in  the  case  of  disrespecting  rules.  Besides  the  pictures,  one  of  her  major 

concerns are tourists hunting for sex tourism (Brazil and particularly Rio is a popular destination 

for that) therefore prostitutes cannot enter and single men are more carefully controlled.  

In terms of future aspirations, Andreia and Cilan share the desire to incorporate the community 

more and to be able to more successfully fulfil some of the community needs. This idea can be 

easily illustrated by Cilan´s statement: “in the future I imagine a studio for youth where they can 

study, learn video production and informatics skills. Gaining new knowledge and learning in order 

to improve their future life. I want to give a better future to the community. I want a day nursery 

centre so moms can go to work in peace. I want better infra-structure in the community and in the 

NGO as well”. The reference to the day care centre for children is important because it is a very 

necessary  service  that  the  Residents  Association  has  been  asking  to  the  government  to 

implemented for years but without success. 

Finally, João Vergara, the director of Cama e Café, also aspires  to increase the benefit sharing 

for the community as well as its participation in the future. A distinction of the above participants 

is that he aims to increase the frequency of the tours. This idea is also present in the vision of 

Evaneide, a resident that works in a bar.

6.1 General Conclusion  

 

This research does not intend to undertake a measurable comparison study but to reinforce the 

theoretical  argument  that  favela  tourism  should  be  analyzed  taking  into account  the  complexity 

and  uniqueness  of  each  context.  Therefore,  based  on  the  previous  qualitative  analysis  it  is 

possible to draw some similarities and differences about the two case studies. 

From a general overview, the population under research presented evidence of interpreting the 

presence  of  tourism  as  a  “breath  of  fresh  air”  in  their  communities.  This  piece  of  information 

reinforces the importance of the social dimension attached to this form of tourism. In fact in both 

favelas  the  social  impact  was  a  priority  highlighted  by  the  community.  Tourism  can  have  an 

impact in the way the favelas are represented to the outside and in the way the favelas are seen 

by  their  own  residents.  In  both  cases  the  presence  of  tourists  was  interpreted  as  a  sign  of 

evolution. Curiously, despite the economic vulnerability that characterizes the population of those 

areas  the  possibility  of  gaining social  benefits,  such  as  an  improvement in  their  image,  was far 

more relevant than obtaining economic profit through tourism. 

The  evidence  found  in  relation  to  the  social  dimension  of  tourism  in  favelas  can  lead  to  a 

reflection  upon  the Brazilian  society  and more  specifically  Rio  de  Janeiro. We can  see  that  the 

dominant  mindset  that  favela  dwellers  are  criminals  and  favelas  are  an  extremely  dangerous 

places  is  still  very  present  in  Rio  de  Janeiro.  Although  favelas  have  gained  a  glamorous  touch 

internationally  which  contributed  for  its  transformation  into  a  tourism  commodity,  at  a  national 

scene  their  image  has  remained  practically  the  same  since  the  eradication  period.  This  data 

reinforces  the  importance  of  tourism  as  a  mechanism  to  promote  understanding  and  mind 

change.  Furthermore,  also  it  reflects  how  fragile  its  implementation  can  be  because  it  can 

reinforce instead of challenge the existing stereotypes. The case of tourists eager to see armed 

people  is  a  good  example  of  how  tourism  can  work  in  favour  of  the  image  constructed  by  the 

media.  

In  both  case  studies,  community  members  are  quite  aware  of  the  stigma  attached  to  the 

condition of favela dwellers. In both favelas tourism represents a chance for them to be looked at 

differently.  The  presence  of  tourists  offers  them  the  opportunity  of  not  being  feared  or  looked 

down on but to be seen as individuals that have to struggle to survive, that have their own way of 

living but have habits, routines and a social behavior similar to many other Brazilians.  

Nevertheless participants also showed awareness concerning the negative impacts that tourism 

can have, mentioning feeling exposed or interrupted in their daily routines. This evidence should 

65 
 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
lead  to  reflection  about  the  assumption  that  some  intellectuals  have  that  favela  dwellers  are 

unable of critical thinking and therefore are not aware of the humiliation that can result from the 

imbalanced  encounter  with  tourists  (Freire-Medeiros,  2007).  The  case  of  Rocinha  is  a  clear 

example that residents are quite aware of the negative consequences that tourism can bring into 

their lives and because of that some are willing to reverse the way tourism is being explored so 

far. 

In  a  general  way,  while  comparing  the  two  case  studies  it  is  possible  to  state  that  the  case  of 

Pereira  da  Silva  reveals  it  to  be  a  more  harmonious  example  than  Rocinha.  The  locals 

responsible  for  the  tourist  activities  share  a  similar  perspective  with  the  rest  of  the  community 

about what tourism can represent for them. The fact that both sides have a similar opinion about 

it  can  justify  the  general  acceptance  of  tourism  and  the  nonexistence  of  negative  feelings.  It  is 

possible  to  say  that  the  fact  that  Andreia  and  Cilan’s  worldviews  are  reflected  in  their 

engagement with their own projects reinforces the positive impact of tourism in the community. In 

the case of Rocinha, although the role and presence of tourism was seen with “good eyes” the 

way it is being developed causes dissatisfaction. In this case, it is important to reflect that tourism 

in  vulnerable  areas  can  lead  to  psychological  disempowerment  since  locals  feel  lack  of  control 

over the direction and path of tourism (Scheyvens, 2003).  

Going  more  in  depth  into  the  social  dimension  of  tourism,  besides  the  fact  that  the  increase  of 

self-esteem is present in both cases another important finding and a common link between these 

two favelas is the fact that both communities associate tourism with freedom and progress. One 

may  say  that  this  evidence  can  constitute  an  extra  argument  when  mentioning  the  social 

dimension of favela tourism. It can attenuate extreme criticism and it can be a new perspective 

for positive effects through tourism in repressed areas. 

Based  on  this  fact  and  taking  into  account  the  literature  used  in  the  theoretical  chapter,  favela 

tourism  can,  to  a  certain  extent,  have  an  impact  on  the  self-esteem  and  general  welfare  of  the 

host communities. It can represent a small step in increasing the personal development of favela 

dwellers and be the beginning of a social transformation.  

In relation to intercultural understanding, the analysis of the selected case studies reveals that it 

is possible to see that the development of tourism in disadvantaged areas does not have to be 

based  exclusively  in  asymmetric  relations  of  power.  It  can  encourage  cultural  exchange  and 

understanding.  It  can  be  an  open  door  for  dialogue  and  if  done  in  a  way  that  coincides  with 

resident  expectations, it  can  lead  to feelings  of  empowerment  and  progress,  as  was  previously 

discussed.  Both  case  studies  show  that  it  can  be  possible.  Nevertheless,  the  nature  of  the 

contours is the crucial element that shapes this interaction and can lead to positive or negative 

consequences.  

 

66 
 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
The  case  of  Rocinha  reveals  that  despite  the  resident  vision  about  contact  with  tourists,  the 

reality  was  different.  In  this  favela  signs  of  imbalanced  power  relations  between  external  and 

internal actors, were present putting locals in a delicate situation, as mentioned before. Plus, the 

contact  with  tourism  was  being  responsible  for  raising  negative  emotions  such  as  feeling 

exposed and misinterpreted. The factor that makes these contact zones less harmonious are not 

the  tourists  themselves  but  the  agencies  and  particularly  the  guides.  Those  are  seen  as 

responsible for making residents feel disempowered by tourism. In fact, no comments were made 

concerning  tourist  behaviour  they  were  all  directed  at  the  guides.  When  the  presence  of  this 

external element was less evident as in the case of more informal encounters the consequences 

were seen as positive.  

Once again, because locals are aware that tourism can lead to demystification of the favela and 

its people, the encounter with tourists is seen as a chance for exposing their side of the story. It 

can be interpreted as their moment of expressing themselves to the outside world. Plus it is also 

an opportunity to reinforce their singularity. The need to show that their favela is unique can be 

connected,  as  was  already  explained,  to  one  of  the  dogmas  that  researcher  Valladares  (2005) 

pointed out.  

Finally  it  is  possible  to  say  that  in  the  case  of  Pereira  the  power  relations  are  less  asymmetric 

because there is no conflict with external elements. Besides the fact that the main motive of the 

tours  is  to  appreciate  an  art  production  that  has  been  present  in  international  exhibitions,  they 

can be a trigger to initially bringing balance into the unavoidable unevenness that exists between 

two such different actors.  

Due  to  the  myths  around  the  favela  and  its  people,  tourism  in  those  areas  also  raises  ethical 

dilemmas. However, the opportunity of bringing tourists to a place where they would not dare to 

enter alone, creates a “contact zone”. If the relation between the two sides is based on respect 

the  result  can  be  enriching  or  at  least  not  harmful  to  any  of  those  involved  (Claire  Williams, 

2008).  

As  a  final  remark  it  is  impossible,  despite  how  integrated  one  can  become,  to  avoid  any 

voyeuristic  feeling  once  someone,  as  a  tourist  or  even  the  position  of  researcher,  enters  an 

unknown  environment.  The  challenge  concerning  favela  tourism  is  to  make  this  encounter  as 

smooth  as  possible  in  order  to  diminish  the  already  existing  assumptions  about  favelados  and 

favela tourism.  

In respect to community involvement, local participation is quite a complex concept and appears 

difficult  to  be  truly  implemented.  Nevertheless,  if  we  compare  both cases,  Pereira da  Silva  has 

higher signs of local participation. In fact tourism was initiated locally and although Morrinho has 

a partnership with an external organization, Cama e Café, there are no signs of conflict or control 

from external forces. This partnership is part of the social vision of this organization that aims to 

67 
 

 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
support  a  favela  located  in  their  neighborhood.  In  fact,  this  alliance  can  be  seen  as  a  good 

example of collaboration for tourism development. If an external and local organization share the 

same vision the result can be quite satisfactory.  

Reflecting  upon  the  data  collected  one  can  recall  the  argument  of  Mowforth  and  Munt  (2003). 

They  argue  that  local  participation  based  on  community  initiation  is  the  only  way  of  breaking 

existing patterns of power and unequal access of tourism development. Indeed, Pereira da Silva 

can be a good example of how locals from a vulnerable community have been able to start their 

business and develop their own tourism activities. It is also a good representation of local agency 

and control. In opposition to Rocinha, there is no interference of power from external forces. In 

this  sense  local  participation  is  a  key  element  in  giving  the  community  a  chance  to  implement 

tourism in a way that will suit their expectations. Nevertheless it is important to keep in mind that 

in  this  particular  context,  tourism  takes  place  in  a  vulnerable  area  with  its  own  particular 

environment.  It  is  due  to  the  favela  context  that  tourism  development  and  participation  reach  a 

higher level of complexity. Toscun (2005) argues that the obstacles of excluded areas make the 

positively proportional relation of community participation and development questionable. Without 

denying  the  importance  of  community  involvement  it  is  essential  to  keep  in  mind  the  area  of 

focus.  The  reality  of  both  case  studies  revealed  how  complex  the  implementation  of  local 

participation can be.  

The  aim  of  invoking  Toscun  is  not  to  shade  the  argument  of  Mowforth  and  Munt  but  to  invoke 

reflection.  Community  participation  is  indeed  a  vital  element  in  order  to  implement  a  type  of 

tourism that will more easily satisfy the residents. Plus it can more effectively reduce the negative 

impacts of tourism. In the case of favelas, community participation gains a double dimension. On 

the one hand, because it is in a favela it can be a good start to implementing feelings of power 

and agency in an excluded community. 

On  the  other  hand,  if  it  is  completely  run  and  developed  by  the  community  it  can  become  an 

extremely difficult challenge to overcome. Due to the socioeconomic reality of favelas the level of 

education  is  low,  few  residents  have  specific  skills  and  in  general  the  access  to  information  is 

restricted.  In  order  to  balance  this  scenario  the  best  solution  would  be  to  give  control  to  the 

community but let their initiative be supported by external actors that could contribute with their 

knowledge.  In  this  sense,  the  case  of  the  NGO  Morrinho  can  illustrate  this  idea.  It  was  their 

initiative  to  transform  their  scale  model  into  a  tourism  point  but  it  was  the  collaboration  with  a 

tourism organization that highly contributed to making their dream a reality. In the case of favela 

tourism, both scholar arguments are not contradicting but complementing each other.  

In  both  cases it  was possible  to find  barriers that  block local  participation.  Despite  the fact  that 

the context and nature of tourism development was quite diverse, lack of local cooperation was 

present in both scenarios. This fact is responsible for reducing the chances of improving the local 

 

68 
 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
involvement  and  benefit  sharing.  There  is  no  collaboration  among  the  different  actors  and  non 

among individuals. The case of the tourism organization in Rocinha was a clear example. They 

had  a  low  level  of  credibility  among  the  residents  and  they  were  struggling  to  attract  local 

engagement.  Complaints  about  the  lack  of  activism  from  the  community  were  also  visible  in 

Pereira, not for the same reasons but in terms of lack of creativity and business initiation.  

It was also possible to see that there is a different level of awareness about the consequences 

and  the  opportunities  that  tourism  can  bring.  This  can  be  justified  by  the  fact  that  there  is  a 

relevant  difference  concerning  the  amount  of  time  exposed  to  tourism  and  the  type  of 

development. In the case of Rocinha, the community has been exposed to tourism for a longer 

period  (10  years)  while  Pereira  began  its  appearance  five  years  ago.  Furthermore,  the  way 

tourism  is  being  developed  is  also  quite  different.  Rocinha  is  a  tourism  destination  officially 

recognized  by  the  local  government.  It  is  explored  by  several  external  agencies.  It  can  attract 

around 2000 visitors a month in the high season and is an intense commercial activity. The locals 

are  far  more  exposed  to  tourism  which  can  contribute  to  a  higher  level  of  awareness  and  a 

clearer understanding that tourism can represent potential opportunities.  

In Pereira da Silva, tourism is still seen as a recent phenomenon. It is undertaken informally and 

less  frequently.  In  total  they  have  around  2000  tourists  per  year  attending  tours.  Besides  the 

difference  in  the  flux  of  tourists,  in  this  case  tourism  can  assume  a  different  nature,  more 

precisely,  an  educational  side.  It  is  common  to  receive  groups  from  high  school,  university 

students to take part in workshops in Morrinho in order to experience how to build a small scale 

favela.  

In  terms  of  community  awareness,  the  level  is  still  low  and  contact  with  tourists  is  seen  as  a 

“breath of fresh air”. This can be explained by the fact that in the past this favela was very closed 

to the external world. As was explained, tourism is not a systematic activity, plus it involves small 

groups  which  can  reinforce  the  residents’  attitude.  The  familiar  environment  that  characterizes 

Pereira  is  not  spoiled  by  the  presence  of  tourists  which  can  lead  to  the  conclusion  that  so  far 

residents do not feel exposed to external eyes.  

The  aim  to  explore  the  role  of  local  participation  in  favela  tourism  is  to  understand  if  there  is a 

relationship  between  this  concept  and  the  positive  effects  that  tourism  can  bring  to  areas  like 

favelas. Taking into account the two case studies it is possible to claim that local participation is a 

key  concept  and  is  intimately  connected  to  the  positive  contribution  that  tourism  can  make  to 

those  communities.  In  fact,  it  was  in  Pereira  da  Silva  where  local  participation  is  evident  that 

presented the higher level of community satisfaction. The presence of local participation, whether 

in decision making or benefit sharing, increases the feeling of power and agency among locals. 

Besides,  community  control  over  tourism  allows  them  to  use  it  as  an  instrument  to  promote 

understanding, providing a small step to demystifying favelas. In conclusion, one can say that in 

 

69 
 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
order to explore the capacity of favela tourism in contributing to a possible social transformation 

community  involvement  is  a  vital  element  and  should  be  integrated  in  further  debates  in  this 

topic.

7.1 Discussion and final Reflection 

 

Reaching this stage implies an overall reflection upon the several months of research done 

so far. At this point, the data collected during fieldwork and the analysis that proceeded after 

will merge with the theoretical support of this study. In order to initiate the process, the first 

step will be to discuss if the objectives of this thesis were successfully accomplished.  

One of the aims of this study was to contribute with understanding about the topic based on the 

community perspective and challenge existing assumptions regarding favela tourism. In this way, 

besides contributing to tourism studies, literature regarding favela tourism also benefits with this 

study. In that sense, it is necessary to evoke the ongoing research of Freire-Medeiros. The work 

developed by this pioneer researcher was a vital element in understanding the complexity of this 

topic.  As  was  said  before,  this  field  lacks  research  and  consequently  is  dominated  by 

assumptions and a strong polarized view. This research intends to bring some clarification to this 

topic by breaking some pre conceived ideas.  

Based  on  the  collected  data  we  can  see  that  some  of  the  assumptions  presented  in  the 

theoretical  chapter  can  be  questionable.  A  common  idea  is  that  the  contact  with  tourists  is  a 

humiliation  for  favela  dwellers.  Through  the  data  evaluation  it  was  possible  to  see  that  in  any 

case the contact with tourists itself was interpreted as a humiliation or asymmetrical. In Rocinha 

there was criticism concerning the way guides were doing their work but not in relation to tourists 

themselves.  In  both  favelas  residents  appreciated  the  possibility  of  interacting  with  external 

people  from  different  cultural  backgrounds  and  to  introduce  them  to  the  place  where  they  live. 

According  to  Freire-Medeiros,  another  assumption  is  that  favelados  lack  critical  thinking  and 

therefore  are  not  aware  of  being  too  exposed  to  tourists.  Once  again,  the  two  case  studies  in 

particular Rocinha showed the opposite.  

In  many  informal  conversations  it  was  clear  the  notion  shared  by  several  residents  that 

depending how it is developed, having tourism in their place can be harmful if is not carried out in 

a  respectful  way  towards  the  community.  It  is  due  to  the  residents’  awareness  that  it  was 

possible to find criticism in relation to pictures taken without permission or the invasive way that 

70 
 

 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
some  tours  circulated  around  the  favela.  As  we  can  see  these  findings  reveals  that  favela 

dwellers are aware of the environment that surrounds them and are not passive agents.  

In an overall analysis this research opens space for the recognition that favela residents do not 

necessarily  need  to  be  in  the  backstage  of  tourism  development,  they  can  as  also  assume 

control  and  an  active  position.  Nevertheless,  residents  do  not  always  succeed  as  expected, 

therefore,  for  a  better  understanding  it  is  essential  to  take  into  account  the  dynamics  of  each 

place and evaluate each case individually. To sum, one can say that the selected case studies 

challenge existing ideas and bring some reflection into the field of favela tourism.  Nevertheless it 

is  important  to  understand  that  although  certain  findings  may  challenge  some  of  the  key  ideas 

present 

in 

the 

literature, 

it  does  not  necessarily  mean 

that 

those  assumptions  are 

unsubstantiated. Favela tourism  can be a form of exploiting the weak ones and reinforce existing 

stereotypes. Rocinha as a case study can reflect this side of tourism. The fundamental idea is to 

understand  that  favela  tourism  can  have  many  versions  and  the  one  indicated  in  the  literature 

does not  has to be the only truth about this matter.  

Furthermore,  the  dynamics  of  the  favela  such  as  the  link  among  community  members,  the 

amount  of  population,  its  level  of  openness  to  external  organizations  and  people,  security, 

urbanization  among  other  factors  is  very  diverse,  contributing  to  make  the  analysis  of  favela 

tourism  a  challenge.  Community  mentality  can  be  a  good  example  of  how  the  favela  dynamic 

influences the direction of tourism development. Although in both case studies residents have a 

similar  vision  of  the  role  of  tourism,  in  the  case  of  Rocinha  despite  the  fact  that  social  benefits 

were  very  much  mentioned  there  are  also  residents  mainly  interested  in  economic  profits.  The 

incoherence among the members of the Local Tourism Organization can be a good illustration of 

how community mentality can block local involvement. Although some were in favor of promoting 

for  free  local  projects  in  order  to  increase  community  participation,  others  believe  that  they 

should charge a fee for supporting local initiatives.    

It  is  possible  to  discuss  about  factors  that  can  contribute  for  such  dilemma.    Rocinha  is  an 

extremely populated and developed favela. It is quite business oriented as it was possible to see 

due to its strong local economy, the presence of external entrepreneurs and an emerging middle 

class. In addition, the link among locals is not so tied.  Due to the overgrowth of Rocinha, today 

this  favela  can  be  seen  as  an  urban  poor  neighborhood.  The  community  sense  that  often 

inspired  many  favelas  residents  to  fight  for  their  rights  and  for  the  benefits  of  the  whole 

community is not so evident.   

In  opposition,  the  dynamics  in  Pereira  da  Silva  are  quite  different.  It  is  a  less  developed  and 

urbanized  favela  with  a  shortage  of  basic  services,  such  as  in  health  and  child  assistance. 

Although it is growing Pereira is quite a small favela compared with many others and especially 

with  Rocinha.  The  environment  present  in  Pereira  still  evokes  the  community  sense  that  was 

 

71 
 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
often  present  in    the  general  past  of  the  favelas.  In  Pereira  da  Silva  the  presence  of  external 

organizations  and  entrepreneurs  is  nonexistent.  Perhaps  this  factor  associated  with  the 

population  density  can  explain  why  the  ties  among  members  are  stronger.  In  general  the 

community environment is closed and the residents rely on each other to survive.  

Despite the fact that the real reason to justify such dissimilarity was not completely found the key 

idea  that  is  possible  to  retain  is  that  the  complexity  of  the  favela  matters  in  terms  of  local 

involvement  and  overall  direction  of  tourism  development.  In  that  sense,  one  can  claim  that 

although it is possible to create space for local involvement and to use tourism in the best way 

according to the community perspective, it does not necessarily means that it can be applicable 

in all cases of favela tourism.  

Having  in  mind  what  has  been  discussed,  this  research  can  also  bring  some  understanding 

about favelas as an object of study. As was mentioned in the theoretical chapter, the researcher 

Valladares highlights in her book “ A invenção da Favela: do mito de origem a favela.com”  that  

the  past  thirty  years  of  research  in  social  science  contributed  to  diffuse,  what  the  author 

classified,  as  the  three  dogmas  related  to:  the  specificity  of  favelas,  the  homogenization  of 

favelas, which means that all favelas are the same and  the social image of the residents since 

favelas are considered exclusively the home of poor people. Based on these dogmas the vision 

of  favelas  is  far  too  simplified,  without  acknowledging  the  fact  that  favelas  have  been  evolving 

throughout time.  

Based  on  the  data  collected  each  dogma  will  be  discussed  individually.  In  respect  to  the 

specificity  of  favelas,  this  dogma  is  related  to  the  fact  that  because  of  the  marginal  history  of 

favelas  they  are  seen  as  areas  apart  from  society.  Places  with  their  own  rules  and  particular 

environment. Indeed favelas are excluded zones and the rules that operate and structure society 

not  always  are  visible.  Nevertheless,  they  are  not  totally  estranged  from  the  Government, 

Municipality  and  the  public  services  that  are  available  for  citizens.  In  reality,  favelas  are 

connected  to  the  rest  of  the  city  at  a  governmental  level  but  each  favela  has  its  own  level  of 

engagement that can be more visible in some than in others.  Furthermore, favela dwellers share 

common  Brazilian  habits  with  the  rest  of  the  citizens  and  nowadays  even  technologies.  The 

access  of  internet  is  rising  in  many  favelas  and  social  networks  like  Face  book  are  particularly 

popular among teenagers. The use of mobile phones is a common practice across all ages. At 

the end, the environment and habits that are present in favelas are not, as  they once were, so 

diverse from the rest of the city. In relation to the second dogma, the two case studies revealed 

that  in  reality,  favelas  are  quite  heterogeneous.  The  Pereira  da  Silva  environment  was  very 

different from Rocinha. This fact was present in the history, in today’s reality and even in the way 

tourism  was  developed.  This  proves  that  when  favelas  are  the  object  of  study  generalizations 

should  be  avoided  because  they  are  not  homogeneous.  As  debated  before,  each  favela 

possesses  its  own  dynamic.  In  respect  to  the  third  dogma,  the  image  of  favela  residents  is 

72 
 

 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
exclusively associated with poverty and social problems. Nowadays some favelas, like Rocinha, 

are  socially  heterogenic.  It  is  possible  to  find  a  diverse  socio-economic  reality.  There  is  an 

emerging  middle  class  inside  Rocinha  and  it  is  possible  to  find  residents  with  a  high  level  of 

academic  education. What  can  possibly  explain  this  growth  is  that  some  favelas,  like  Rocinha, 

became  intensive  economic  centres,  with  a  strong  local  economy  and  the  capacity  to  attract 

external business people who are willing to open their businesses inside Rocinha because it is a 

profitable market.  

As we can see, the dogmas highlighted by Valladares are inappropriate to the modern favelas of 

today. The ideas that sustain those dogmas correspond to a favela that existed in the past. It has 

not  adjusted  to  the  evolution  that  favelas  have  been  a  target  of  all  this  time.  Favelas  have 

suffered  a  metamorphosis  and  research  must  acknowledge  that  so  it  can  diffuse  a  more 

appropriate vision of what currently is a favela. 

The second aim of this study was to explore the potential of favela tourism as a vehicle for social 

transformation. Although it can be seen as a very idealistic and intangible goal to establish in a 

work  with  a  specific  time  limitation  such  as  a  master  thesis,  it  is  possible  to  say  that  there  are 

signs  that  the  presence  of  tourism  in  poor  areas  like  favelas  can  be  a  starting  point  for  a 

transformation  at  a  social  level.  Both  cases  revealed  how  important  the  social  dimension  is  for 

the  communities.  The  residents’  aspirations  from  both  favelas  associated  tourism  as  the 

opportunity to be seen detached from the image portrayed by the media, to interact with different 

cultures,  to  broaden  their  horizons,  to  achieve  other  skills  and  to  open  space  for  new 

opportunities.  Besides the clear effect on their self-esteem, other elements can be integrated in 

the  social  dimension  of  favela  tourism.  A  sense  of  progress,  evolution  and  even  freedom  were 

present in the two case studies. Keeping in mind the history of these favelas, residents see the 

presence  of  tourists  as  a  sign  of  peace,  of  tranquility  (even  if  it  is  fragile).  It  helps  them  to  feel 

less  excluded  and  more  integrated  in  the  city.  This  finding  can  represent  another  argument  to 

reinforce the importance of the social aspect of favela tourism. As we can see, although slight, 

there is light evidence that this form of tourism can have the potential to be a trigger for a social 

transformation. 

Based  on  the  selected  case  studies,  the  lesson  that  can  be  learned  is  that  the  moral  debates 

concerning  the  introduction  of  tourism  in  favelas  should  be  focused  on  how  tourism  is 

implemented in favelas. It is not the presence of tourism but rather how it is developed that is the 

bottom  line  issue.  It  is  the  way  that  tourism  is  being  run  that  affects  the  communities  and 

optimizes (or not) the positive side of favela tourism. Following this line of thought, the concept of 

local participation is a crucial element to be incorporated in the debates of favela tourism or even 

in discussions concerning the positive impacts of tourism in disadvantage areas.  

 

73 
 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
The  data  collected  shows  that  a  large  portion  of  the  potential  of  favela  tourism  in  leaving  a 

positive legacy relies on the presence of local participation. The integration of the communities is 

a  vital  element  in  order to  achieve  the social  impact  that  tourism can  represent  in  those areas. 

Although local participation in none of the case studies was fully applied, the case of Pereira da 

Silva can be seen as an example of local initiative. Invoking the argument of Mowforth and Munt 

(2003) the only forms of local participation that can break existing patterns of power and unequal 

access of tourism development are the ones originated within the community. This point of view 

can be illustrated with the case of Pereira da Silva.  

In opposition to Rocinha, tourism was initiated by community members and they do not have to 

compete with external forces. The fact that residents were responsible for the tourism activities 

was a very important factor that influenced the whole development and impact that tourism has 

on that community. It was an essential element to balance the relationship between tourists and 

residents,  plus  it  was  the  reason  beneath  the  homogeneous  view  concerning  what  tourism 

represented for that community. In this sense, because those that run tourism activities are also 

part of the community there is a common vision of what tourism can bring for them.  

Therefore,  they  are  using  their  projects  to  address  higher  goals  such  as  image  improvement, 

motivation  for  residents  in  gaining  new  skills  and  integrating  others  as  much  as  they  can. 

Although the involvement of the community is still on a small scale there are several individuals 

that are directly benefiting from the introduction of tourism in their neighbourhood. A reason that 

can explain the minimal level of involvement is related to the fact that both projects are relatively 

recent and still in the development phase, especially the case of NGO Morrinho. Nevertheless, it 

is  the  local  participation  factor  which  is  the major difference  between  the  two  case  studies  and 

the reason why the feeling of exploitation and invasion were not present in Pereira da Silva but in 

Rocinha.  Still  in  relation  to  local  participation,  as  explained  before,  while  exploring  the 

complexities of favela tourism in the selected case studies, the difficulties that the community of 

Rocinha faces while trying to implement such a concept it become evident. Besides the obvious 

domination of the external travel agencies, internally, there are internal obstacles like community 

mentality,  such  as  lack  of  trust  in  associations  and  individualism,  which  reduces  the  chance  of 

stimulating residents to work together as a unified force.  

Gazing  favela  tourism  as  a  form  of  transmodern  tourism  is  not  a  “black  and  white  picture”. 

Transmodernity  was  the  chosen  paradigm  because  it  emphasizes  the  positive  legacy  that 

tourism in poor areas can have. It invites the opportunity to erase pessimistic mentality, to be free 

from assumptions and sensationalistic analogies (such as urban safaris) and to be able to look 

for  positive  examples  and  successful  stories.  Transmodernity  acknowledges  that  reality  is 

constantly  changing  therefore  favelas  can  be  seen  as  places  that  are  in  constant  evolution 

instead of static enclaves. The Spanish philosopher Rosa Maria Rodriguez Magda in her essay 

 

74 
 

Rita Duarte - Exploring the Social Impacts of Favela Tourism 

 
La Sonrisa de Saturno hacia una teoria transmoderna ( 1989), uses the logic of thesis, antithesis 

and synthesis to describe the mind shift process of moving from modernity to transmodernity.  

Making an analogy with it about this topic, one can say that transmodern perspective on favela 

tourism is not about defending that tourism in poor areas is the only solution for economic profit 

and development or either that tourism is just about commodifying third world poverty for western 

leisure.  It  is  about  accepting  both  sides  but  being  able  to  go  beyond  that  and  gain  a  more 

integrative view.  

In that sense, based on the data analysis it is possible to find indicators that can stimulate a new 

direction  of  favela  tourism  as  a  potential  agent  for  social  transformation.  The  first  one  is  local 

involvement  since  it  is  a  crucial  factor  in  optimizing  the  positive  effects  of  tourism.  Then 

partnerships  with  external  organizations  that  are  purpose  and  not  profit  driven.  It  can  be  a  key 

contribution  to  integrate  favelas  into  the  tourism  market  and  to  avoid  conflicts  of  power  and 

control. Finally, another quite relevant aspect is the mindset of residents in relation to the role of 

tourism.  They  share  the  vision  that  tourism  can  be  a  mechanism  for  promoting  understanding 

and reducing stereotypes. Finally, locals prioritize social benefits instead of economic ones which 

can  reflect  their  awareness  of  the  positive  impact  that  tourism  can  have  in  their  communities. 

Following this line, the data demonstrates that favela tourism, and in particular Pereira da Silva, 

has  the  potential  to  be  a  platform  for  social  transformation  and  mind  shift  towards  favelas. 

Tourism is used as a vehicle to show another side of the favela and its people. Interaction and 

dialogue between residents and tourists can be achieved in the tourism format of Pereira. Those 

that are responsible for it showed themselves to be morally engaged in improving the community 

through  tourism.  Furthermore,  the  fact  that  both  projects  received  good  critiques  from  some  of 

the most important newspapers in Brazil increases their contribution in opening space for public 

opinion to start associating favelas with positive news.  

As  a  final  remark,  the  results  of  this  research  allow  me  to  claim  that  transmodernity  may  open 

space to reconstruct a new image or to add a new vision into the portrait of favela tourism. This 

research does not intend to prove if favela tourism is indeed transmodern or not. In fact such a 

task seems to be meaningless since transmodernity is a recent and far too philosophical concept 

to  be measured.  The  intension  was  to bring  a  new  light,  a  new  vision of  tourism  inside favelas 

based on the communities’ point of view. In that sense, as a researcher I assume that this study 

successfully accomplished its predefined mission.

7.2 Limitations and Scope for Further Research 

 

This  study  was  restricted  to  a  limited  fieldwork  experience  of  three  months  in  two  favelas 

Rocinha  and Pereira  da Silva.  The goal  was  to get  an  insight  of  the  residents’  vision  of  having 

tourism in their favelas in order to explore the possibility of tourism being an initiator of a social 

transformation.  Further  research  should include  tourists’ motivations  and mindset  about favelas 

and compare it before and after experiencing a favela tourism activity. In that sense it would be 

possible to more precisely evaluate the change in perception after experiencing favela tourism. In 

order to confirm the importance of local participation in optimizing the positive effect of tourism, it 

would  be  relevant  to  analyze  and  compare  a  group  of  tourists  from  an  external  agency  and 

another  one  from  a  local  run  activity.    Furthermore,  it  would  also  be  relevant  to  explore  other 

case studies and search for more positive examples of partnerships between local and external 

organizations.
