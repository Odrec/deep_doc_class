A  Theory  of  Groups  and  Organizations 

A.  THE  PURPOSE  OF  ORGANIZATION 

Since most  (though by  no means all)  of the action taken  by  or on 
behalf of groups of individuals is  taken through organizations, it will 
be helpful to consider organizations in a general or  theoretical  way.1 
The logical  place  to  begin  any  systematic  study  of  organizations  is 
with  their  purpose.  But  there  are  all  types  and  shapes  and  sizes  of 
organizations,  even  of  economic  organizations,  and  there  is  then 
some  question  whether  there  is  any  single  purpose  that  would  be 
characteristic  of  organizations  generally.  One  purpose  that  is  none(cid:173)
theless  characteristic of  most  organizations,  and  surely  of  practically 
all organizations with  an  important economic  aspect,  is  the  further(cid:173)
ance of the interests of their members. That would seem  obvious,  at 
least from the economist's perspective. To be sure, some organizations 
may  out  of  ignorance  fail  to  further  their  members'  interests,  and 
others  may  be  enticed into serving only  the  ends  of  the  leadership.2 

1.  Economists  have  for  the  most  part  neglected  to  develop  theories  of  organiza(cid:173)
tions,  but  there  are a  few  works  from  an  economic  point  of  view  on  the  subject.  See, 
for  example,  three  papers  by  Jacob  Marschak,  "Elements  for  a  Theory  of  Teams," 
Management  Science,  I  (January  1955),  127-137,  "Towards  an  Economic  Theory  of 
Organization  and  Information,"  in  Decision  Procesus,  ed.  R.  M.  Thrall,  C.  H.  Combs, 
and  R.  L.  Davis  (New  York:  John  Wiley,  1954),  pp.  187-220,  and  "Efficient  and 
Viable  Organization  Forms,"  in  Modern  Organization  Theory, ed.  Mason  Haire  (New 
York:  John  Wiley,  1959),  pp.  307-320;  two  papers  by  R.  Radner,  "Application  of 
Linear  Programming  to  Team  Decision  Problems,"  Management  Science,  V  (January 
1959),  143-150,  and  "Team  Decision  Problems,"  Annals  of  Mathematical  Statistics, 
XXXIII  (September  1962),  857-881;  C.  B.  McGuire,  "Some  Team  Models  of  a  Sales 
Organization,"  Management  Science,  VII  (January  1961),  101-130;  Oskar  Morgen(cid:173)
stern,  Prolegomena  to  a  Theory  of  Organization  (Santa  Monica,  CaliÂ£.:  RAND 
Research  Memorandum  734,1951); James  G.  March  and  Herbert A.  Simon,  Organiza(cid:173)
tions  (New  York:  John  Wiley,  1958);  Kenneth  Boulding,  The  Organizational 
Revolution  (New  York:  Harper,  1953). 

2.  Max  Weber called  attention  to  the  case  where  an  organization  continues  to  exist 
for  some  time  after  it  has  become  meaningless  because  some  official  is  making  a 
living  out  of  it.  See  his  Theory  of  Social  and  Economic  Organization,  trans.  Talcott 
Parsons  and  A.  M.  Henderson  (New  York:  Oxford  University  Press,  1947),  p.  318.
