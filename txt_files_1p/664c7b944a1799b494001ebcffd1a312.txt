1. Introduction

The dispute between compatibilists and incompatibilists must be one of the
most persistent and heated deadlocks in Western philosophy. Incompatibilists
maintain that people are not fully morally responsible if determinism is true,
i.e., if every event is an inevitable consequence of the prior conditions and
the natural laws. By contrast, compatibilists maintain that even if determin-
ism is true our moral responsibility is not undermined in the slightest, for
determinism and moral responsibility are perfectly consistent.1

The debate between these two positions has invoked many different re-
sources, including quantum mechanics, social psychology, and basic meta-
physics. But recent discussions have relied heavily on arguments that draw on
people’s intuitions about particular cases. Some philosophers have claimed
that people have incompatibilist intuitions (e.g., Kane 1999, 218; Strawson
1986, 30; Vargas 2006); others have challenged this claim and suggested that
people’s intuitions actually fit with compatibilism (Nahmias et al. 2005). But
although philosophers have constructed increasingly sophisticated arguments
about the implications of people’s intuitions, there has been remarkably lit-
tle discussion about why people have the intuitions they do. That is to say,
relatively little has been said about the specific psychological processes that
generate or sustain people’s intuitions. And yet, it seems clear that questions
about the sources of people’s intuitions could have a major impact on debates
