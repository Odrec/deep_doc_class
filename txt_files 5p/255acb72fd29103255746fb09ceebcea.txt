Anisotropy 

Binding of an unpaired electron to a molecular 
system causes a shift away from the free electron 
g-value   (e.g. DPPH: g = 2.0036 ↔ ge = 2.0023) 

    hn = (ge+Dg) b B  
    hn = (ge+Dg) b B  

Dg  = contribution from the orbital momentum 
 
 Dg  is largely determined by 
       the nitrogen atoms of the porphyrin plane, if the magnetic field is along the X axis 
       the His nitrogen and Met sulfur, if the magnetic field is along the Z axis 

The model system: 
a cytochrome c with a low-spin ferric iron 

  different resonance positions (g values) for the X and Z orientation:   gx  gz 
  different resonance positions (g values) for the X and Z orientation:   gx  gz 

...but it does’nt matter, if the magnetic field axis is along X or Y 

  the same resonance positions (g values) for the X and Y orientation:   gx = gy 
  the same resonance positions (g values) for the X and Y orientation:   gx = gy

The line shape is described by the Lorentz distribution. 
The line shape is described by the Lorentz distribution. 

Due to the Heisenberg uncertainty inequality the energy distribution increases with decreasing time,  

which is the life time of the excited state,  

i.e. the linewidth is inversely proportional to the relaxation time t.

Relaxation

(we transfer spin from the ground state to the excited state) 

Relaxation processes  are responsible for the return of the excited system back to thermal equilibrium! 
Relaxation processes  are responsible for the return of the excited system back to thermal equilibrium! 

Note: without relaxation , excitation of EPR transitions could only be performed up to 
          equilibration of the population difference between the two states  =  Saturation 
 
 

  Recording of an EPR spectrum would not be possible. 

Two types of relaxation: 

Spin-lattice relaxation:    causes changes in ms and therefore in the energy of the spin system 

  In solids:  energy transfer through fluctuations of local B fields               
 
  In liquids:  fluctuations induced by molecular motions and collisions 

   caused by lattice vibrations 

  spin-lattice  or  longitudinal relaxation time T1 

Spin-spin relaxation: 

  does not require exchange of energy  with the environment 
  type of interaction e.g. an energy conserving  spin flip-flop of two spins 

  spin-spin  or  transverse relaxation time T2
