The Global Politics of Sport 

Sport presents one of the most advanced cases of ‘globalisation’, arguably because there 
are fewer cultural and political obstacles to the development of trade and international 
power in sport than there are in other fields. Thus there has been a change in the nature of 
the  politics  of  sport  since  the  end  of  the  Cold  War;  the  subject  must  be  rewritten  to 
acknowledge a twenty-first-century world in which international sporting organisations 
and transnational corporations have become far more important than states. 

The Global Politics of Sport presents a range of essays examining the emerging global 

political issues in twenty-first-century sport including: 
• The role and power of organisations such as FIFA and IOC 
• The influence of US exceptionalism 
• The construction of global sports heroes 
• Tensions developing within traditionally ‘alternative’ sports in a global commercial 

culture. 

The Global Politics of Sport presents new and fresh exploration of different conceptions 
of sport as a purely commercial activity and as an activity as embodying ‘higher’ social 
and ethical values. It is a sequel to The Politics of Sport and The Global Politics of Sport, 
which were previously the leading works in the field. 

Lincoln Allison was the founding Director of the Warwick Centre for Study of Sport 
in Society. He is currently Visiting Professor in the politics of sport at the University of 
Brighton and will be Emeritus Reader in politics at the University of Warwick.
