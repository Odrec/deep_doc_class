Outline

● Topic & application (slides 2-4)

● This weeks homework (slides 5-7)

● New MatLab know-how for you (slides 8-12)

 

 

Where do people look?

●  the makeup of an image determines where we look at
● Eyetracking helps to study and understand visual effects 

 

 

Are there low level features?

Do we look at high contrast? Luminance? Color?

 →To answer we can look at e.g. contrast 
distributions of whole images and compare it with  
distributions of fixations

 

 

Image and Fixations

 

 

Contrast and Luminance 
Distributions  - how it should look like

R e d   /   G re e n

B lu e   /   Y e llo w

L u m in a n c e

 

 

Global Contrast vs. fixated contrast

- how it should look like

 

 

MatLab Newcomers of the week

● New data loading functions

i = imread();    % loads .png and .bmp

● New plotting functions like 

subplot(r,c,i);  % beautiful systemic plot  

imagesc(img);    % plots an image 

hist(Y);         % plots an histogram 

see help hist !!!

see help imagesc     Tip (default y-axis)

●   These may will be useful

round(X); 

double(); 

% rounds the elements of X to the 
  nearest integers

% converts any numerical type into 
  type double 

reshape(A,r,c); % shapes A column-wise to r x c  

sub2ind(size(A),R,C); % Gets indeces for cells     
                              (R(1),C(1)), (R(2),C(2))   
                              and so on in Matrix A
Note: 
n = hist(Y) will save the results in n without plotting them

● Improve your plot's appearance

 

xlim(); or ylim()  % sets axes to given limits
