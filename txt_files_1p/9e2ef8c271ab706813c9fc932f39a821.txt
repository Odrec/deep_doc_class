Recently Gates has, with K. Anthony
Appiah, co-edited the encyclopedia Encarta
Africana. As well as continuing his work of
recovery and retrieval of marginalized
African American texts, he has become in-
creasingly interested in investigating and
reporting on the lives of contemporary
African Americans. He is the co-author,
with Cornel West, of The Future of the
Race (1996), which reﬂects on the relation-
ship between the black elite and the larger
black community, and has written and pro-
duced a number of documentaries that ex-
plore African Americans’ history and their
present. The publications that accompany
these series include America Beyond the Color
Line (2004). In the last few years, he has
increasingly taken on the role of public
intellectual, not only broadcasting on PBS
but also publishing articles in such main-
stream publications as the New Yorker and
New York Times.

Gender Theory

GENDER

Historically, the term “gender” has been
used primarily as a grammatical term, re-
ferring to the classiﬁcation of nouns (in
languages including Latin, French, and
German) as masculine, feminine, or neuter.
It is derived from the Old French term for
“genre” which, in turn, derives from the
Latin genus, meaning “birth,” “family,” or
“nation,” but also referring back to older
and broader meanings such as “kind” or
“type.” The other use of “gender,” to refer to
the (human) state of being male or female,
also dates back to the fourteenth century,
but it’s not until the twentieth century that
the latter usage becomes common. In the
late twentieth century, thanks largely to the
inﬂuence of feminism, “gender” tends to be
distinguished from “sex,” with the former
seen as referring to the culturally attributed
characteristics associated with being a
woman or a man, and the latter viewed as
a matter of nature or biology, although, as
