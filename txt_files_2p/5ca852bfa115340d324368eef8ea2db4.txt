Code/Message

 
Searching for a definition of poetry, other readers look for ‘universal truth’ or 
some  other  deeper  meaning  in  poetry  more  than  in  prose,  the  famous 
nineteenth-century  critic  Matthew  Arnold  for  instance  (see  Arnold  1880). 
Again,  while  some  poetry  might  very  well  deal  with  universal  truths,  this  is 
probably  not  the  case  for  all.  There  is  no  doubt  some  poetry  which  is  very 
lovely and very popular but which, at bottom, is really neither very profound 
nor  the  expression  of  a  universal  truth.  Take  these  lines  by  Ben  Jonson  for 
instance, one of the most popular love songs in the last 400 years:

Group 2: Types of Poetry
•Explain the following types or forms of poetry:

And I will pledge with mine; 
Or leave a kiss but in the cup, 
And I’ll not look for wine. 
The thirst that from the soul doth rise, 
Doth ask a drink divine: 
But might I of Jove’s nectar sup, 
I would not change for thine. 
[...] 

•Ode
•Sonnet
•Dramatic monologue
•Epic
•Mock-epic
•ballad

 
In  fact,  to  expect  statements  of  universal  truth  from  poetry  can  be  rather 
misleading if one deduces from this that what matters in a poem is somehow 
what lies behind the language and its use (for this problem see the discussion in 
Warren/Brooks 1960: 6-20), whereas modern criticism insists that form cannot 
be separated from meaning (See also Theme ch. 1.5.). 

It  is  difficult  to  answer  the  question  ‘What  is  Poetry?’  conclusively, 
though most people are more or less able to recognise poetry when they see it. 
One recent critic has suggested the following criteria in answer to the question 
‘What is Poetry?’ (Müller-Zettelmann 2000: 73-156):
