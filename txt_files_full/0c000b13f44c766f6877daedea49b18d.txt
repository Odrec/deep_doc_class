f-*---J nrr-liii.T;1 An Introduction to the Analysis of Drama 
Suit the action to the word, the word  to the action, with this special observance, that 
you o'erstep not the modesty of nature. For  anything so o'erdone is from the purpose of 
playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was and is to hold as 'twere the mirror up 
to nature.

Aims and 
content of 
this chapter 

When, in the Passage quoted above, Hamlet advises the actors 
~
performing the play within a play in Hamlet to coordinate word 
and action, language and gesture, he highlights the close relation- 
ship between the written  text of  a  drama and its performance 
in the theatre. Hamlet's comment that the first and ultimate goal 
of acting is "to hold [...I  the mirror up to nature" is admittedly his- 
torically determined and based on a particular conception of lit- 
erature as imitation of nature; however, his reference to the inter- 
play between word and gesture alludes to a central aspect of the 
theory of  drama  and identifies two  important  components of 
drama. 
The main goal of this chapter is to identify the fundamental fea- 
tures of the composition of drama, to give a preliminary overview 
of  some of  the fundamentals of  the  analysis  of  drama and to 
introduce the most important categories and transferable meth- 
ods of drama analysis. Beginning with the tension between drama 
and theatre, we will examine some constitutive features of  dra- 
matic texts. Following this, a  communication model for drama 
will be developed that also takes into account the specificities of 
the theatrical context. A short introduction will then be given to 
the basics of a semiotics of theatre, which has increased awareness 
of the part played by non-verbal theatrical codes. The remainder 
of the chapter will be devoted to a Summary of the most important 
terms and models used to describe the various elements and struc- 
tures of dramatic texts. 
Dramatic texts differ from other literary genres in their commu- 
~h~ dra- 
mat;c text  as  nication situation. It is important to remember that, in contrast 
to an essay or a poem, a dramatic text is not primarily written to 
script arid 
be read, but rather as a script for a theatre performance. Dramas 
the 
are therefore texts that are written to be performed as plays, and 
this performance  requires not only a  script, but also the entire

apparatus of theatre production, which often includes consider- 
able resources in terms of personnel and organisation. 
It is true that dramatic texts are generally written by an author and 
read by individual recipients; however, when a play is performed, 
the communication  situation  is entirely  different. Several indi- 
vidual~ (for example, director, dramatic advisor, set-designers and 
actors/actresses) are involved in the production of a play; perform-  tion 
ances are usually attended by large audiences. This phenomenon 
is referred to as "[tlhe collective nature of production  and reception" 
(PFISTER 1988: 11). The few dramas that are produced primarily as 
reading material do not change the fact that watching, and not 
reading, is the most appropriate mode of reception for drama. 
The process of  preparing  a drama for performance represents a 
form of literary adaptation, in that it involves substituting another 
medium for the literary text (see chapter 6.3.). While dramatic 
texts only exist in written form, theatre performances use non- 
verbal as well as verbal modes of communication: the theatrical 
realisation of a dramatic text involves an acoustic (voices, noises, 
music) and an optical dimension (set, presentation of the charac- 
ters, gesture, facial expression), as well as occasionally engaging 
other modes of sensory perception. We can describe a theatre per- 
formance as a "multimedial form ofpresentation" (PFISTER 1988: 6), 
because the performance of a play draws on a wide repertoire of 
verbal and non-verbal signs and codes, as well as on a variety of 
modes of perception or communication channels. 
Drama and theatre are therefore closely related; the dramatic text 
lnteraction 
functions as the script on which a performance is based. Given  bemeen 
that text and performance are valued equally as artistic works, it  drama arid 
is perhaps most appropriate to regard the dramatic text "as a text 
theatre 
to be performed, as a literary artefact conceived with a view to its per- 
formance" (HOFELE 1991: l l). This avoids ascribing greater value 
to either text or performance, and instead does justice to both as 
distinct modes or media of artistic expression. 
As  many features of a dramatic work can be varied in perform-  Variations in 
ance and the actors generally have considerable scope for indi- 
vidual interpretation, every performance should be regarded as  „d  produc- 
an independent 'theatrical work of art'. A comparison of the var-  tion 
ious performances of any individual drama illustrates this capac- 
ity for variation, which affects in particular the presentation  of 
characters, gesture and setting, whereas the outlines of the action 
and the temporal structure of a drama tend to be prescribed  by 
the text. Theatre performance differs in various ways from drama 
as written text, the most obvious difference being that the perform- 
ance is a transient event that can never be exactly reproduced.

Theatre 
studies vs. 
English 
literary 
studies 

Although theatre studies and English and American literary stud- 
ies are both concerned with the broad field of drama and theatre, 
their objectives and methods differ  considerably. Since theatre 
studies became established as a n  independent discipline, the fol- 
lowing distinction between the two disciplines has become widely 
accepted: theatre studies focuses primarily on the 'theatrical work' 
or the 'theatrical text', i. e. on the various aspects of the perform- 
ance and production of plays in a theatre. It is therefore primarily 
concerned with the analysis of actual performances on the basis 
of a semiotics of theatre (See chapter 4.3.). English and American 
literary studies, on the other hand, are concerned primanly with 
the analysis and interpretation  of  dramas as printed texts, and 
thus focus particularly on the written sources of theatre perform- 
ances, on the generic characteristics of dramatic texts, and on the 
interpretation  and thematic as well as formal characteristics of 
individual dramas. 

performance  Since the 1980s, however, interpretative approaches that are con- 
cerned primarily with performance and known as 'perforrnance 
criticism 
criticism' have gained in currency within English literary studies. 
Performance  criticism  encompasses  a  variety  of  approaches, 
which focus primarily on the 'implied production' already inher- 
ent within a dramatic text, or on the analysis of actual perform- 
ances. Thus drama is analysed with a view to its production poten- 
tial. ANDREAS HOFELE (1991: 18f.) describes the "irnpliedperforrnance 
[. . .] as the ensernble of instructions that a drarna offers for its produc- 
tion: the pointer that is written into the drarnatic text towards the 'text' 
that is to be produced  - the text of the perforrnance - but not towards 
the perforrnance itself". 

stage forms  The character of each theatre production is determined to a large 
degree by the individual  stage form, which  also influences  the 
audience's  experience of  the  production,  the  distance between 
actors and audience and the acting style. In Ancient Greece, plays 
were performed in amphitheatres, closer in terms of size to today's 
football Stadiums than to our modern play-houses. The audience 
sat in a semicircle around the stage, and the lack of stage Set and 
the  distance  from  the  audience  made a  realistic  performance 
impossible.  Theatre  in Shakespearean times,  by  contrast,  was 
characterised by close contact between the actors and the audi- 
ence, with the audience packed closely on various levels around 
three sides of  the stage. The stage and the seating were 'lit'  by 
natural daylight, and the Set was minimal, thus encouraging the 
audience to use their imagination to embellish what they saw. 
Certainly, the physical features of Shakespearean theatre were not 
conducive to a realistic imitation of reality. Today's most common 
stage form with its box-like structure, lighting, curtains and other

props is far more suited to the creation of aesthetic illusion. The 
actors can act as if an invisible 'fourth wall' separated events on 
stage from the audience. However, the experimentation with stage 
forms that is common in today's theatre, and that frequently harks 
back to old models, is indicative of  dissatisfaction with this con- 
vention. 

A Communication Model for Dramatic Texts: 
Special Features of Theatre Communication 

As we saw in our examination of  the dramatic genre, the com-  ~ommu,.,ica~ 
munication Situation of a dramatic text is fundamentally differ-  tion struc- 
ent from that of a lyric text. Admittedly, in the case of both genres  ture of lyric 
a  distinction  can  be  made  between  external  communication  „d  dra- 
involving the historical author and recipient, and communication  matic texts 
within the text.  However, in addition to the collective nature of 
the production and reception of theatre performance (and also of 
film), there are significant differences between the internal com- 
munication Situations of dramatic and lyric texts. 
A communication  model  for drama enables us to represent  in 
commu- 
graphic form some of the main differences between dramatic texts 
,iCation 
and other literary genres. This communication model highlights  model for 
three main communicative peculiarities of dramatic texts: firstly,  dramatic 
on  an internal  level,  dramas  comprise  several  speakers  and  texts 
addressees in the form of the various characters. Secondly, these 
characters can move between the roles of addresser and addressee 
as often as they like, as indicated in the diagram by the arrows 
pointing in both directions. This leads on to the final major pecu- 
liarity of dramatic communication, which is that dialogue is the 
most important medium for the transmission of information. We 
should note, however, that a number of lyric texts also incorporate 
dialogues, and that various forms of  monological Speech occur 
frequently in dramas.

This model also demonstrates that, in the majority of  dramas, 
internal communication takes place on only one textual level, the 
level of the characters. In narrative texts, by contrast, the events 
which take place on the level of the characters are mediated by a 
narrator (see chapter 5.2.). The lack of a mediating level of com- 
munication is generally considered to be one of the most important 
differences between dramatic and narrative texts and is referred to 
as "the absolute nature of drarnatic texts" (PFISTER 1988: 4). 
In addition to these major differences between dramatic and nar- 
cornrnuni- 
rative texts, we should also take into account the communication 
cation situa- 
tion in drarna  situation of  the theatre performance.  The situations that frame 
the act of reading a dramatic text on the one hand, and the thea- 
arid in the 
tre performance on the other, are presented schematically in the 
theatre 
model below.

(sec P I A T ~ - ~ A I J R Y  

1978: 41) 

In the case of the act of reading a drama, the author functions as 
the addresser, the dramatic text as the message, and the reader as 
the addressee. In the case of a theatre performance, however, the 
entire theatre apparatus, consisting of the collection of individuals 
involved in its production, assumes the role of the addresser, the 
performance constitutes the message, and the audience assumes 
the role of the addressee, which is also collective. These two com- 
munication processes are, however, closely linked and influence 
each other mutually (in the figure above this reciprocal influence 
is indicated by the arrows between 'dramatic text' and 'perform- 
ance'). 
Even more than the act of reading a drama, a theatre performance 
is a  highly complex process of  communication, in the Course of 
which meaning is constituted simultaneously on a number of lev- 
els: "a drarnatic level (interaction between the characters on stage), a 
theatrical level (cornrnunication between  the Cast and  the audience) 
and the level of everyday life (social cornmunication about the produc- 
tion and its relation to everyday norrns)" (MAHLER 1992: 71). 
Even the internal structure of dramatic texts anticipates perform- 
ance. Dramatic texts comprise, firstly, a level of verbal communi- 
cation that is composed of  the characters' remarks, or the dia- 
logue. However, they generally also contain more or less detailed 
information on how the text is to be performed, usually printed 
in italics. Whilst the characters' remarks constitute the 'pnmary 
text', which during the performance is to be spoken aloud by the 
actors, the stage directions are part of the 'secondary text'. These 
directions mainly concern the stage Set as well as the characters' 
gestures and facial expressions, all of which can be prescribed to 
a  greater or lesser degree by the playwright, but are ultimately 
realised  in  each  individual  performance.  The  secondary  text 
includes all constituent parts of a dramatic text that are not Part 
of the dialogue. In addition to the stage directions these include, 
for example, the demarcation of acts and scenes, information as 
to which character is speaking, and various other elements such 
as the title of the play, dedications, prefaces and the list of drarna- 
tis Personae (characters) at the beginning. 
Despite the aforementioned 'absolute nature of  dramatic texts',  ~~~~~~i~~ 
there are also numerous instances that contradict the widely-held  „d 
the 
view that drama does not feature a communication level of nar-  „„,tor 
in 
rative transmission or a narrator. Many dramas, especially from  drarna 
the 20th century, but also from earlier periods in the history of the 
genre, contain narrative elements, particularly at the beginning; 
in many plays a  superordinate narrative frame to the action is 
constructed. Examples of  this technique  can be found in plays 
such as THORNTON WILDER'S Our Town (1938) and  Pi r I i< Siini i I ii's

Further epic 
elements 

hugely successful Amadeus (1979). These plays are illustrative of 
certain structural characteristics and communication techniques 
which, thanks to their proximity to various characteristics of nar- 
rative (or epic) texts, are described as 'epic'. The character of  the 
Stage Manager in Our Town and Salieri in Amadeus both appear 
in the dramas as mediating, narrating instances, with the result 
that the communication structure of these dramas is shifted closer 
to that of narrative texts (See chapter 5). 
The distinction between the introduction of epic elements by char- 
acters 'inside the action' and by characters 'outside the action' (See 
PFISTER 1988: 74ff.), is  based  on whether  or  not  the  narrating 
instance is involved in the action of the drama. SHAFFER'S Amadeus 
is an example of a drama in which a character 'inside the action' 
assumes the role of  a  narrator. In  contrast to what one might 
assume from the title, this play does not tell the Story of Mozart's 
life and achievements; instead it offers a retrospective outline of 
the decisive episodes in Salieri's intrigues against his detested rival, 
presented in a succession of scenes and from Salieri's perspective. 
Salieri functions as a kind of  first-person narrator, who not only 
recounts,  comments  on  and evaluates  the  central  episodes of 
his own life, which is overshadowed by his rivalry with Mozart; 
he also introduces himself  and addresses his audience directly, 
in the hope of winning its understanding. The role of the narrator 
in WILDER'S Our Town, by contrast, is occupied by a character 'out- 
side the action', who is not involved on the communication level 
of the characters, instead presiding over events as a kind of direc- 
tor. 
Besides the introduction of a narrator, there are further epic ele- 
ments to be found in drama. We  can distinguish between verbal 
forms, for example stage directions involving commentary as well 
as projections and banners,  and non-verbal forms of  epic ele- 
ments, the most important of which is the destruction of the the- 
atrical illusion and exposure of its mechanisms, for example when 
a character steps out of  his or her role. The techniques pioneered 
by BERTOLT BRECHT 
in his 'epic theatre'  often serve as a means of 
producing the so-called 'alienation effect'. In contrast to this, the 
inclusion of narrative within drama - for example internal nar- 
rating instances or messenger Speeches - often merely functions 
as a  means of  giving information; it therefore enhances rather 
than destroys the aesthetic illusion. 

Semiotics of Theatre and Non-Verbal Theatrical Codes 
is of 
tic 

As  the main focus in English literary studies is generally placed 
on the analysis of  drama as a written text, those aspects which 
are primarily or exclusively concerned with performance are fre- 
quently neglected. The main emphasis is usually placed on the 
analysis  of  textual  characteristics,  which  is  sometimes  supple- 
mented by watching the play performed in the theatre or on video. 
lt is, of course, not possible to do justice to all aspects of perform- 
ance analysis in the course of one short introduction; however, we 
hope to illustrate the aforementioned point that theatre commu- 
nication  differs considerably  from the experience  of  reading  a 
dramatic text, in terms of the medium and sign system as well as 
in terms of the reception process. 
The study of  the signs and codes of  theatre communication  is  premises 
known as 'semiotics of theatre'. This area of enquiry takes account 
of the complexity of  the various verbal and non-verbal sign sys- 
tems of  the theatre, which are also described as 'theatre codes'. 
New theories of drama and semiotics of theatre proceed from the 
premise that the spoken text is only one of the many dimensions 
or sign Systems that contribute to a performance, and that the 
non-verbal codes are also of great importance for communication 
within theatrical performances. 
When devising a system for theatrical codes, we first must deter- 
mine whether the sign is verbal or non-verbal. lf it is non-verbal, 
we have to find out whether it is related to the actors, the stage or 
other aspects of  the dramatic production. Further fundamental  verbal 
distinctions can be made between acoustic and optical or visual 
theatre 
signs, and between 'durative' theatre codes that remain constant 
over an extended period of time (such as the stage Set) and 'non- 
durative',  temporary  codes  (for  example,  gestures  and  facial 
expressions). The following diagram, which is based on work by 
the Polish theatre semiotician TADEUSZ KOWZAN, provides a sche- 
matic and systematic  overview  of  the most  important  theatre 
codes (See PFISTER 1988: 8; ASTON/SAVONA 

1991: 105).

Transmission of Information and Verbal Communication 
AS this typology of theatre codes illustrates, information can be 
transmitted in dramatic texts by means of both verbal and non- 
verbal codes and channels. In addition to propelling the action 
forward, verbal communication between the characters also con- 
veys important information concerning the characters themselves, 
as well as time, place and all other aspects of the fictional world 
that are presented. 
In both dramatic and narrative texts, the term 'exposition' refers

to the transmission of introductory information necessary for an

introduction  understanding  of  the initial  dramatic events.  'Exposition'  and 
'dramatic introduction' differ (see PFISTER 1988: 86ff.) in that they 
perform different functions: the introduction serves primarily to 
establish a  communication channel between  the stage and the 
audience ('phatic function'), to awaken the interest ofthe audience

and to acclimatise it to the atmosphere ofthe play. The exposition, 
by contrast, has the function of informing the reader or audience 
about the history preceding the action and of  introducing them 
to the time and place of the action, and the characters ('referential 
function', providing information). The dramatic introduction and 
exposition  can occur simultaneously in the opening or the first 
act of the play; however, there are some famous examples of the 
two occurring in succession in SHAKESPEARE'S dramas, for example, 
the witches' prelude in Macbeth (1605106) and the shipwreck at 
the beginning of The Tempest (1610111). 
Although in classical and neo-classical drama the exposition gen- 
erally takes place in the first act, this is by  no means the only 
possibility. There are two basic varieties of exposition, which we 
will  refer to as 'initial'  and 'integrated'  exposition. The former 
refers to the inclusion of all expository information in an isolated 
Passage at the beginning of  the text, separate from the action 
proper. In the case of the second, however, the expository informa- 
tion is distnbuted in small quantities throughout the text, woven 
into the action  (see PFISTER 1988: 87f.). In  classical  drama, the 
prologue, a mainstay of epic theatre, is the most common form of 
exposition.  However,  in  modern  dramas the  prehistory  of  the 
action is generally communicated in the form of  an expository 
monologue (or soliloquy) or in the dialogue between the charac- 
ters. 
An extreme variety of integrated exposition occurs in analytical 
drama, in which the exposition continues throughout the entire 
action or text. In analytical dramas (and similarly in analytical 
narratives), the action consists primarily in the gradual disclosure 
of the past events that have led to the initial situation. 
The various forms of monologue and dialogue represent further 
fundamental categories and areas of  enquiry in the analysis of  „d 
drama, and are therefore basic subject-matter in university courses  monologue 
on literary studies. We should bear in mind, however, that these 
categories  are  artificial  constructs,  conventions specific to  the 
theatre,  which  are subject  to  historical  change.  Dialogue  and 
monologue are important methods of  transmitting information 
in many dramas, and can perform diverse functions. Other meth- 
ods of conveying information that occur in drama are, for exam- 
ple, the messenger speech and the so-called 'teichoscopy' (whereby 
characters observe and simultaneously report events that are hap- 
pening off-stage). 
The term 'dialogue' refers to a succession of remarks and counter-  ~
remarks (or 'utterances')  between two or more characters ('duo- 
logue' and 'polylogue'; see PFISTER 1988: 141). In a dialoguc, thc

characters exchange thoughts or opinions, discuss a topic or plot 
an intrigue. Dialogue is often referred to as the basic structure of 
drama, as it is a central constituent of the majority of dramas, and 
the progression  of  the action relies primarily  on the characters' 
contributions in dialogue. Although dialogue is a central element 
of  drama, it is by no means restricted to this genre; dialogue is 
also an important constituent of  films and radio  plays,  and is 
frequently employed in narrative genres such as novels, short sto- 
ries, fairy-tales and ballads. 
The categories used in the analysis of dialogue are therefore appli- 
cable to a  number of  genres and media. When analysing dia- 
logue, it is important to consider the length of  individual utter- 
ances, the distribution of contributions among the characters, as 
well as the frequency with which the role of the speaker changes. 
The temporal relations between the various utterances can also 
yield important clues for interpretation: in addition to the more 
common model of  linear succession of  individual utterances in 
dialogue,  interruption  (which  could  be  described  as a  partial 
simultaneity of utterances) is also common, and can function as 
a  sign of  malfunctioning  communication.  Consideration  must 
also be given to the 'syntagmatics',  or the logical coherence, of the 
dialogue; here, the three most important aspects for analysis are 
the structure of  the logical interrelation between  the individual 
parts of an utterance, the relationship of an utterance to previous 
ones by the Same character, and to preceding  remarks by other 
characters (see PFISTER 1988: chapter 4.6.4.). 
Although dialogues frequently appear to be very 'true to life', we 
should be aware when analysing them that they are in fact liter- 
ary constructs that have been conventionalised to varying degrees 
and perform specific roles within the play. Whilst real conversa- 
tions in everyday life primarily fulfil communicative and social 
needs, dramatic dialogues can serve quite different purposes. Dia- 
logues Set the action of a drama in motion and ensure its progres- 
sion. They are also central to characterisation, and serve as a 
medium  for conflict,  for  the clarification  of  opinions, and  for 
expounding central themes. It should be taken into account, how- 
ever,  that  the  functions  of  dialogue  are  subject  to  historical 
change. 
The  'artificiality'  of dialogue is  particularly evident  in English 
comedies of  the  Restoration  period  (1660-ca. 1700). From  this 
period  onwards, intellectual, artificial conversation  came to be 
regarded as one of the typical features of the so-called 'comedy of 
manners'. This conversational style, known as 'wit', is exemplified 
by plays such as WILLIAM WYCHERLEY'S 
The Country Wife (1675) and 
W1i.i.i~~ CON(;RI:VI:'S The  Way  of the  World  (1700), as well as the 

Fun 
dialogue 

Wit 

comedies composed in the 1890s by OSCAR WILDE (1854-1900). The 
dialogue is not merely humorous; it comprises a verbal duel of a 
highly subtle, intellectual nature. The characters who are described 
as 'wits' make frequent use of certain rhetorical figures; the rep- 
etition of unusual similes and metaphors is particularly common. 
Wit  also  often  uses  the  rhetorical  figure  of  paradox,  linking 
together  terms  that  seemingly  have  nothing  to  do  with  one 
another, and may even be mutually contradictory. 
We speak of a 'soliloquy' when a character is alone on stage while  ~~~~l~~~~ 
speaking, or is regardless of any hearers. The device is often used  „d 
for the divulgence of innermost feelings. A 'monologue' is when  so~i~oquy 
a character speaks alone, but in the explicit presence of  others. 
The two terms thus correspond to the German Selbstgespräch and 
Monolog respectively. (It is important  to note,  however, that in 
English usage 'soliloquy'  and 'monologue'  are often used inter- 
changeably - See Oxford English Dictionary.) The information con- 
veyed in monologues and soliloquies is often characterised by a 
high degree of  subjectivity. Monologues  and soliloquies do not, 
therefore, offer an 'objective' view of a situation; instead they bear 
the mark of the individual speaker's characteristics and perspec- 
tive. Such Speeches can range in length from several lines to a 
comprehensive commentary. Note that a  'dramatic monologue' 
is not a part of a drama but a Poem (notably perfected by Robert 
Browning, See chapter 3.2.) or other non-dramatic composition in 
the form of a soliloquy. 
Monological speech is specific to the drama; there is no real paral-  ~~~~l 
on the convention of a character thinking aloud on stage, it rep-  , dramatic

Monologues and soliloquies, therefore, are only plausible in the 
context of the author's and the audience's shared acceptance of 
this convention. Realistic dramas, which aim to create the illusion 
that the events could genuinely occur as they are being presented, 
tend to avoid monological speech because of its obvious artificial- 
ity.  In  addition  to  informing  the audience  about a  character's 
thoughts, feelings and plans, monological speech can also serve as 
a link between vanous appearances of characters and as a transi- 
tion between scenes, as well as connecting episodes of the dramatic 
action by narrating events that are not presented on the stage.

soliloquy in 
~ ; ~ h ~ ~ d  

ologues and soliloquies are directed towards the speakers them- 
selves or the audience, rather than other characters in the per- 
formance. Monological  utterances also differ from dialogues in 
that they are often more limited in terms of theme, but greater in 
terms of length, than dialogical utterances. 
Despite these  differences, there are some instances  of  overlaps 
between  dialogical  and monological  speech. 'Monological  ten- 
in dialogue,  dencies'  in dialogue occur when there is a considerable tliscrep- 
ancy between the length and frequency of the contributions, with 
dialogical 
the result that one character becomes dominant. When there is 
tendencies 
considerable Consensus between two partners in a dialogue, this 
in mono- 
is also Seen as a monological tendency. On the other hand, mon- 
logue arid 
ologues and soliloquies are said to contain 'dialogical tendencies' 
when the speaker addresses an absent figure or object (see PFISTER 
1988: 129ff.). A famous example of such an address is Macbeth's 
dagger soliloquy. 
The following soliloquy, addressed to the audience by the pro- 
tagonist at the beginning of  Richard 111 (1592/93), one of  SHAKE- 
SPEIRE'S  most important history plays, is illustrative of some of the 
peculiarities of monological speech and the functions it can per- 
form. As  this  speech occurs at the beginning  of  the play,  it is 
described as an 'introductory soliloquy'.  In contrast to the solilo- 
quies featured in SHAKESPEARE'S 
tragedies, Richard's soliloquy shows 
none of  the mental confusion and incoherence characteristic of 
Hamlet's or Macbeth's conflict-ridden consciousness. Instead, the 
thoughts and plans of the protagonist, Richard, Duke of Glouces- 
ter, are presented in an ordered, logical sequence.

And oll the clouds thot loured upon our house

Aside 

The 'aside'  represents a  further mode of  speech  specific to the 
drama. This convention also exemplifies the artificiality of many 
methods of transmitting information in drama. As in the case of 
monological  speech,  the  aside  is  frequently  addressed  not  to 
another character on the stage, but to the reader or the audience 
in  the  theatre.  MANFRED PFISTER (1988:  137-140)  differentiates 
between three different types of  aside: 
R the 'monological aside', in which a character voices a thought, 
which is not expressed anywhere else, in such a way that only 
the audience understands (usually indicated by the stage direc- 
tion 'Aside'); 
B the 'dialogical aside', in which, unnoticed by other characters 
on the stage, a group of  initiated characters conduct a  con- 
spiratorial conversation in whispers (usually indicated by the 
stage direction 'Aside to X'); 
the 'aside ad spectatores', in which a character addresses a com- 
ment directly to the audience (usually indicated by the stage 
direction 'Addressing the audience'). 

ing  Monologues, soliloquies and asides represent a particularly inter- 
esting means of transmitting information in drama, as they make 
it possible to impart information to the audience (or reader) alone. 
Consequently, the aside provides the audience with an advantage 
over the other characters, from whom the information is withheld. 
Monological asides and asides ad spectatores therefore enable the 
author to control the distribution of information to the advantage 
of the audience and disadvantage of the other characters. 
The various forms of dialogical and monological speech are there- 
fore important in determining to what extent the various charac- 
ters and the reader or audience are informed about the dramatic 
events and the plans of the characters. If the audience is placed 
at an advantage or disadvantage in comparison with the charac- 
ters, the situation is described as 'discrepant awareness'. 'Congru- 
ent awareness' occurs when characters and audience are provided 
with identical information. Even within the internal communica- 
tion System, however, the levels of awareness of the various char- 
acters can vary considerably, with discrepant levels of awareness 
frequently leading to misunderstandings or communication dif- 
ficulties between the characters. 
Discrepant awareness is also a  precondition  for dramatic irony 
(which is not to be confused with verbal irony, where the speaker 
says the opposite of  what he or she means). Dramatic irony is 
based on a  discrepancy between the internal and the external 
communication Systems, or between the level of awareness of the 
characters and that of the audience. For dramatic irony to occur,

the audience or reader must be privy to information that is not 
available to the character concerned. This Superior level of knowl- 
edge grants the audience or reader an insight into the character's 
errors of  judgement,  which imbues his or her remarks with an 
unconscious or unintentional additional meaning. In contrast to 
intentionally ironic remarks,  in the case of  dramatic irony the 
speaker him- or herself is the butt of the irony. Dramatic irony can 
be comic or tragic, depending on the individual situation. 

Character and Action 

~

~

In addition to time and place, character and action are the most  ~
~
elementary constituents of dramatic and narrative texts, as well  of dramatic 
as of  films. Close examination of the portrayal of character and  arid narra- 
of the presented or narrated story is therefore central to the anal-  ti„ 
texts 
ysis of dramas, narrative texts and films. There are consequently 
numerous parallels between the analysis of dramatic and narra- 
tive  texts, with  regard to character and action as well  as with 
regard to the presentation of  time and place. However, the two 
genres also have individual specific characteristics. The following 
section will begin with general information on the terms 'action' 
and 'character' before going on to discuss the presentation of char- 
acters  and action  in  dramatic texts.  Although  characters and 
action in narrative genres (for example novels and short stories) 
are subject to narrative mediation  (See chapter S), many of  the 
categories introduced below are also relevant and useful for an 
analysis  of  both  narrative  texts and narrative genres in  other 
media (See chapter 6). 
In literary texts and films, the term 'action'  in its widest sense  ~~~i~~ 
implies a change or perpetuation of a situation brought about by 
the characters. Four factors influence the behaviour of  the char- 
acters,  and therefore  the  development  of  the  action: abilities, 
needs, motivation and intention. The intentions of the characters 
are among the most important motors of the action, although in 
tragedy especially, the intentions of the individual characters are 
often frustrated by external powers. In comedy, the conclusion is 
generally brought about by chance occurrences and the misfiring 
of  the opponent's plans,  rather than by the success of  the pro- 
tagonist's plans. 
With specific reference to dramatic action, VOLKER KLOTZ makes a  units arid 
distinction between Open and closed forms. The latter refers to an  composition 
entirely self-contained story, which is brought to a definite conclu-  of the action 
sion. Units of action are composed of scenes and acts. The clussicul 
form of  the tragedy corresponds to the ideal of  a  laryely closcd

drama has been defined as 'imitation ofaction'. 

ultimately one-sided, however, as character and plot are necessar- 
ily interdependent. 
Ever since ARISTOTLE, 
lnterdepen- 
The dramatic action arises from the dialogue between the charac-  denCe of 
ters, which sets and keeps the action in motion. There is a correla-  character 
tion between character and action: on the one hand, the characters  „d  action 
act on the basis of  their necessarily limited  perspectives; on the 
other hand, the action affects the perspective of a character, because 
the knowledge, abilities and needs, as well as the motivation and 
intentions of a character can be changed by every action. 
The expression 'dramatis personae' is used to refer to all of the liter-  ~
ary characters who appear in a play. The first act of  a drama is 
usually preceded by a list of the dramatis personae. Depending on 
their  importance  in  the  play,  a  distinction  is  generally  made 
between the main characters and the minor characters although 
the boundary between the two is permeable. 
An important means of structuring the dramatis personae consists  correspon- 
in the similarities and differences between the characters. These  denCes arid 
semantic equivalences and oppositions are referred to as 'corre-  contrasts 
spondences and contrasts' (see PFISTER 1988: 163). The peculiarities 
of individual characters are highlighted by their difference from 
other figures. For example, the positive qualities of a  heroine or 
her0 are far more evident if he or she is juxtaposed with a villain 
than with another positive character. 
The structure of  the dramatis personae  in plays,  narratives  and  character 
films can be simplified by means of a graphic presentation of their  conste~~a- 
relationships to each other, known as the 'character constellation'. 
This expression is used to describe the dynamic structure of  the 
dramatis personae  in a  drama, novel or film. It does not merely 
refer to the traits of  the various characters; it also encompasses 
the characters and their relationships  throughout the text. The 
sources of  impending  conflict,  and, therefore, of  the  dramatic 
action, can often be located in the constellations between the char- 
acters and the irreconcilability  of  their motives.  Certain genres 
such as the comedy of  manners are characterised by fairly con- 
ventionalised character constellations; many tragedies are based 
on a clear opposition between the protagonist and the antagonist. 
Within  the wide variety  of  dramatic and narrative genres, the 
character constellations display a  high degree of  historical and 
cultural variability. 
The  most  important  criterion  for  the  analysis of  scenes is the  character 
entrance or exit of one or several characters. This alters the number  configura. 
of characters present on the stage, described as the 'configuration' 
of  characters. By  examining the structure of  thc churtictcr  con-

concept arid 
Whereas characters in  a  dramatic text are constituted  only by 
status 
their words and actions, in dramatic performance and film the 
physical presence and body language of  the actor contribute to 
the  characterisation.  It  is  therefore  important  to  differentiate 
between the (real) actor and the (fictive) role that he or she plays 
on stage. 
lt is possible to distinguish between various styles of staging char- 
acters, depending on the degree of  stylisation, or the extent to 
which they aim to preserve the illusion of performance. 'Neoclas- 
sical' styles are characterised by their adherence to rules and con- 
ventions, and their emphasis on the play's dignity and solemnity. 
'Naturalistic'  styles, on the other hand, aim to  encourage  the 
audience to empathise with the characters. BRECHT'S 
'epic theatre' 
famously strove to retain the distance between actors and audience 
with a range of 'alienating'  techniques. A similar range of styles 
of staging characters can also be found in films, where the period 
or genre to which the film belongs plays an important role. We 
should be careful to differentiate, however, between the demands 
of the theatre, where gestures and facial expressions have to be 
more strongly emphasised because of the distance between actors 
and audience, and those of  film,  where it is possible to record 
details such as facial expressions and nuances of body language 
in close-ups. 
There are various different approaches to characterisation within 
~
literary studies, based on diverse understandings of what consti- 
tutes a character. In the majority of interpretations, characters are 
treated  as real,  existing  individuals,  with  the  major emphasis 
being placed on the psychologies of the characters and their rela- 
tionships to one another; this is based on a realistic or mimetic 
understanding of literary characters which assumes that they are 
'true  to  life'  and 'imitate'  real  people.  Structuralist theories  of 
drama and narrative,  on the other hand, Stress the functional 
roles performed by characters. They consider characters as agents 
or functions of the plot rather than as 'psychological entities', and 
therefore refer to them as 'actants'. In his analysis of the Russian 
fairy-tale, VLADIMIR PROPP identified  a  number of  plot functions, 
which he linked to the roles of  particular actants or plot agents 
(for example, hero, helper, donor or villain). Both approaches are

figuration, we can ascertain how important a single character is 
within the play, as the number of configurations in which a char- 
acter participates is an index of his or her Status and of the rela- 
tionship between the characters. 
The expression  'Figurenperspektive',  which was coined by PFISTER 
(1977: 90), offers a range of  further possible applications of  the 
term  'perspective' when  analysing characters in dramatic (and 
narrative) texts. 'Character  perspective' can be used to describe 
the individual, more or less restricted view of reality of every char- 
acter, as determined by three major factors: firstly, the character's 
level of knowledge; secondly, the character's psychological dispo- 
sition; and thirdly, the character's  ideological persuasions.  The 
level of  knowledge and the psychological disposition determine 
the spectrum of characteristics and the personality of a character. 
As  the vague term 'ideological persuasions'  is problematic,  not 
least because of the diverse connotations of the term 'ideology', it 
can be replaced by the more precise concept of 'values and norms'. 
These terms are analytically more useful, as the character's values 
and norms generally appear explicitly in the text and are there- 
fore easier to identify than his or her 'ideological persuasions'. The 
expression 'character perspective' therefore encompasses all those 
features that constitute a character and his or her subjective model 
of reality or view of the fictional world. 
In the theory of drama, the term 'Perspektivenstruktur' or 'perspec- 
tive structure' has been coined by theorists of  drama (see PFISTER 
1974 and 1988) in order to describe the entirety of character per- 
spectives and their relationship to each other. The expression has 
also proved useful in the analysis of narrative texts (see chapter 
5.3.). As the perspective structure of a text is based on the selection 
and combination of character perspectives, two aspects are to be 
taken into consideration: the paradigmatic dimension, consisting 
of  the selection of  character perspectives,  and the syntagmatic 
dimension, which refers to the combination of perspectives. Both 
are relevant for our evaluation  of  characters; in the context of 
18th-century sentimental drama, which features a host of nearly 
ideal  characters, even those with minor flaws appear to be  far 
worse then they would, for instance, in one of the rather cynical 
Restoration comedies or in the plays of OSCAR WILDE. The perspec- 
tive structure in  sentimental comedies is therefore much  more 
homogenous than that of WILDE'S comedies of manners or GEORGE 
BERNARD SHAW'S plays. 
The diverse categories used to analyse the relationship between 
closed vs. 
the character  perspectives can  be  subsumed beneath  a  broad, 
open 
perspective  overall distinction between dramas (and also novels and films) 
with  closed  and Open  perspective structures  (see PFISTER 1988: 
structure 

O4  -Al  An Intro~luclion to the Analysis of Drama 

65ff.). In  the case of  a  closed perspective structure, the diverse 
character perspectives ultimately converge on one point, convey- 
ing the impression of a unitary view of the world. An Open perspec- 
tive structure, by contrast, occurs when a drama presents no such 
convergence point and the individual character perspectives are 
divergent. 
When  considering  the character  conception,  we  should  firstly  character 
ascertain whether characters remain unchanged throughout the  conception 
drama, or whether they develop ('static' versus 'dynamic charac- 
ters'). We should also consider whether a character is a one-dimen- 
sional 'type' characterised by a small, internally consistent collec- 
tion of features, or a multidimensional character presented as an 
individual with a large number of characteristics. There is a broad 
spectrum of possible kinds of characterisation, comprising various 
degrees of  individualisation. The two extremes of  this spectrum 
are the 'personification',  a figure who embodies or personifies a 
single characteristic; and the 'individual', who has so many dif- 
ferent features that he or she seems to have as complex a charac- 
ter as a  real human being. A large variety  of  characters exists 
between these two extremes. 
The terms 'individual' and 'type' are used to differentiate between 
two varieties of literary characters. 'Type' is used to refer to a char- 
acter who has few specific human characteristics and individual 
features, or who is characterised, for example, as a representative 
of a social class. We can differentiate between various types: the 
psychological type embodies a particular mode of human behav- 
iour (for example, the grouch or the skinflint), whereas the social 
type is based on a particular profession or social class (for exam- 
ple,  the courtier, city-dweller or peasant). There is also a  wide 
variety  of  ethnic, regional and national stereotypes, as well  as 
gender stereotypes. A complex literary character, by contrast, is 
supplied with a large number of characteristics. The main empha- 
sis is placed on the uniqueness and personal individuality of such 
characters; they are presented as multi-facetted and characterised 
by a large number of personal traits, and are therefore thought to 
resemble genuine human beings. 
This distinction between type and character corresponds closely  ~l~~ 
to E. M. FORSTER'S differentiation between 'flat' and 'round', or one-  characters 
dimensional and multi-dimensional, characters. In genres such 
round 
as the novel or the tragedy, the individualised characters tend to  characters 
be in the majority; the comedy and other genres such as satire, 
romance, and certain film genres such as the Western, by contrast, 
tend towards character types. A genre in which the characters bear 
a conspicuously close resemblance to types is the English Restora- 
tion comedy, which usually includes such fiyures as the aristo-

cratic libertine, the lascivious, hypocritical and puritanical bour- 
geois, the dim-witted country bumpkin and the man-eating elderly 
woman among its dramatis personae. 
In the Course of  literary history,  we See  a  progressive  tendency 
towards greater individualisation of characters. The exempla of the 
literature of Late Antiquity and of medieval morality plays gener- 
aIly embody an abstract concept, a vice or a virtue, and therefore 
function as personifications. The character types in the comedies 
of the Renaissance and of the 17th to the 20th centuries, by con- 
trast, comprise a limited selection of psychological or sociological 
characteristics, rather than representing one Single concept. In the 
late 17th and early 18th centuries, the representation of characters 
as types is even elevated to the status of a normative rule by neo- 
classical poetics. With its demands for 'appropriate' characterisa- 
tion, described as 'decomm', the neo-classical school enshrines the 
categorisation of the human being according to age, gender, social 
status and nationality, which first appeared in ARISTOTLE'S 
rhetoric 
and in HORACE'S poetics. This neoclassical character typology has 
fallen  increasingly  into disuse  since  the  Romantic  period  (ca. 
1780-1830),  however, and has been replaced by individualising 
and psychologising  characterisation techniques, which Stress the 
complexity and diversity of human identity. 
In addition to constellation, configuration and conception, char- 
acterisation, or the conveyance of information concerning a char- 
acter, is central to the analysis of  drama (and also of  narrative 
texts and films). Characterisation is concerned with the question 
of  how characters are supplied with  characteristics or semantic 
features. In drama there is a broad spectrum of characterisation 
techniques, which  can be  systematised  with  the aid of  specific 
criteria  (See  PFISTER 1988:  183ff.). Firstly,  a  distinction  is  made 
between 'figural'  and 'authorial techniques of characterisation', 
according to whether it is the author or the characters themselves 
who convey the relevant information. In the case of 'figural char- 
acterisation', the information is supplied primarily by the Speech, 
gestures and actions of the characters, whereas character informa- 
tion is supplied by 'authorial' means if it derives from the structure 
of the entire play. A further criterion is based on the explicitness 
of the character information: in the case of explicit characterisa- 
tion,  the features and traits  of  a  character are stated  outright, 
whereas implicit techniques of characterisation present the traits 
and behaviour of a character and allow the recipient to draw his 
or her own conclusions. 
Figural forms of  characterisation include all those techniques in 
which the characters themselves supply the information. Charac- 
ters can characterise themselves by means of  'explicit self-com-

mentary', or they can characterise others; in both cases we should  ~
i
~
tech- 
bear in mind, however, that the comments are distorted by the 
individual character's perspective and may therefore be unrelia-  characterisa- 
ble. The dramatis personae also characterise themselves implicitly 
by means of their behaviour, actions and manners of  speaking 
throughout the play. We should adopt the basic premise that every 
explicit characterisation of others is also an implicit self-charac- 
terisation, as the comments made by a character about others also 
enable us to draw conclusions concerning his or her own values, 
norms and personality traits. 
Among the most common techniques of authorial characterisa-  ~
tion are descriptions in the Stage directions, and the use of telling 
names that impart implicit information. The similarities and dif- 
ferences, or the aforementioned 'correspondences and contrasts' 
between the characters, also contribute to characterisation. The 
following diagram provides a n  overview of the most important 
techniques of characterisation.
