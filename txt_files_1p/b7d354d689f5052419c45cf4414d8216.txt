Abstract
Listeria monocytogenes is an intracellular bacterial pathogen that pro-
motes its internalization within nonprofessional phagocytes by interact-
ing with speciﬁc host cell receptors. L. monocytogenes resides transiently
in a membrane-bound compartment before escaping into the host cell
cytosol where bacterial proliferation takes place. Actin-based motil-
ity then promotes cell-to-cell pathogen spread. Extensive studies on
cytoskeleton rearrangements, membrane trafﬁcking, and other events
have established this microorganism as an archetype of cellular func-
tion subversion for intracellular parasitism. Here we discuss the most
signiﬁcant membrane trafﬁcking pathways hijacked by L. monocytogenes
during the host cell infection process and compare them to those of
other intracellular pathogens, in particular Shigella ﬂexneri, Salmonella
enterica, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
