Foundations of Logic

Homework 12: Argument Reconstruction

Due January 28th, 2014

Exercise 1 (8/20)

Are the following claims true or false? Briefly explain each answer.

1.1.

1.2. 

1.3.

The only reason to study logic is to analyze and evaluate natural language arguments.

The semantic tree method can be used to show that an argument scheme is invalid in Lpred
by showing that the corresponding inference conditional has no models.
We can use GLCQ to show that an argument scheme Φ1, Φ2,…, Φn ∴ 
just because GLCQ is sound. The fact that GLCQ is also complete does not matter for this 
purpose.

 Ψ is valid in Lpred 

1.4.

All formal languages are undecidable.

Exercise 2 (12/20)

Reconstruct the following English arguments in Lpred.

2.1.

2.2.

2.3.

Some rappers are gangsters. Many hustlers are not rappers. Obviously, there are emcees 
who are not gangsters. So that must mean that there are hustlers who are also emcees.

All rappers who are not gangsters are rich. All hustlers are rappers. Some hustlers are not 
rich. So there must be at least one gangster.

Some rappers, like all gangsters, are either rich or they die tryin'. Not all rappers are rich. 
Therefore, there are some gangsters who die tryin'.
