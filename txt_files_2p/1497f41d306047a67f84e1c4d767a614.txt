has independently acquired a mechanism for
repressing stem cell division. Because isolated
stem cells can proliferate in the absence of
exogenous growth factors and the size of the
stem cell population may be regulated in vivo
by the number of NR progenitor cells during
development, this quiescence is likely due to an
inhibitory environment in the adult eye. Once
freed from the inhibition (or if inhibitory factors
can be overcome in vivo), the stem cells have
the potential to generate new retinal cells.

Motion Integration and

Postdiction in Visual Awareness

David M. Eagleman1,2,4* and Terrence J. Sejnowski2,3,4

In the (cid:223)ash-lag illusion, a (cid:223)ash and a moving object in the same location appear
to be offset. A series of psychophysical experiments yields data inconsistent
with two previously proposed explanations: motion extrapolation (a predictive
model) and latency difference (an online model). We propose an alternative in
which visual awareness is neither predictive nor online but is postdictive, so that
the percept attributed to the time of the (cid:223)ash is a function of events that
happen in the ;80 milliseconds after the (cid:223)ash. The results here show how
interpolation of the past is the only framework of the three models that
provides a uni(cid:222)ed explanation for the (cid:223)ash-lag phenomenon.

The flash-lag effect is a robust visual illusion
wherein a flash and a moving object that appear
in the same location are perceived to be dis-
placed from one another (1, 2). Two explana-
tions have been suggested in recent years: The
first proposal is that the visual system is predic-
tive, accounting for neural delays by extrapo-
lating the trajectory of a moving stimulus into
the future (2). The second is that the visual
system processes moving objects more quickly
than flashed objects. This “latency difference”
hypothesis asserts that by the time the flashed
object is processed, the moving object has al-
ready moved to a new position (3, 4). The latter
proposal tacitly rests on the assumption that
awareness (what the participant reports) is an
online, or
real-time, phenomenon, coming
about as soon as a stimulus reaches its “percep-
tual end point” (5). We have designed a series
of psychophysical experiments to directly test
these two frameworks. Our results are inconsis-
tent with both models. Here we propose that
visual awareness is postdictive, so that the per-
cept attributed to the time of an event is a
function of what happens in the ;80 ms fol-
lowing the event.

To directly test extrapolation into the future
against interpolation of the past, we designed a
series of psychophysical experiments. Five par-
ticipants sat in front of a computer screen and
were instructed to indicate whether a flashed
white disk occurred above or below the center
of a moving ring (Fig. 1A) (6). Beginning with

the frame following the flash, the ring took one
of three randomly interleaved trajectories: con-
tinuing, stopping, or reversing direction (Fig.
1A). The initial trajectory of the ring (up to and
including the frame with the flash) was identi-
cal in all three conditions; thus, if motion ex-
trapolation were occurring, the predicted trajec-
tory should be the same. Contrary to that hy-
pothesis, the perceived position of the flash
relative to the ring was independent of the
initial trajectory. In the case of the uninterrupted
trajectory, participants perceived the flash to be
in the middle of the ring when the flash was
physically displaced 5.39° 6 0.9° in front of the
moving ring, as expected from previous studies
of the flash-lag effect. However, in the presen-
tations wherein the moving ring stopped, par-
ticipants reported the ring and flash co-local-
ized when there was no displacement
(20.36° 6 0.27°), indicating that movement
preceding the flash does not by itself engen-
der the flash-lag illusion. When the ring re-
versed direction immediately after the flash,
participants reported colocalization of the
ring and the flash only when the flash was
physically displaced by an average of 26.47°
6 0.8°. The direction of the flash-lag effect is
opposite in the continuous and reversing con-
ditions, but the magnitude of the effect is the
same (t test, P . 0.398, t 5 20.89). On the
other hand, those two conditions are signifi-
cantly different from the stopping condition
(P , 0.0017, t 5 6.11), wherein no illusion is
seen (7).

These results indicate that the perceived po-
sition of the flash relative to the ring is not
dictated by the initial trajectory because if vi-
sual awareness were predictive, the same initial
trajectory would lead to the same extrapolation.
Our results are consistent with a recent demon-
stration by Whitney and Murakami in which the
perceived displacement of a flash was influ-

enced by a motion change that occurred after
the flash (4). In our experiment, by directly
comparing stimuli with an identical pre-flash
trajectory to three different post-flash trajecto-
ries, we demonstrated that the perceived dis-
placement of the flashed and moving stimuli is
a function of the movement after the flash. (In
the stopped case there is no flash-lag effect at
all.) Thus, we suggest that the perception attrib-
uted to an event at time t0 depends on what

happens in t0
window of time whose magnitude serves as a
lower bound on the length of the delay before
visual awareness.

, t , t0

To verify that the pre-flash trajectory plays
no role in the flash-lag effect, we made another
test in which the flash and ring appeared on the
screen at the same time and the ring’s move-
ment began in the next video frame (8). Thus,
there is no trajectory (no previous motion) from
which to extrapolate. The results (Fig. 1B) are
essentially unchanged from Fig. 1A (P . 0.75,
P . 0.35, P . 0.55, for the continuous,
stopped, and reversed cases, respectively), sup-
porting the conclusion that motion extrapola-
tion is untenable and that only events after the
flash determine the perception. The similarity
of results in Fig. 1, A and B, suggests that the
flash resets motion integration in the visual
system, making motion after the flash effective-
ly like motion that starts de novo (Fig. 1B). One
explanation may be that the flash temporarily
redirects attention (9).

To determine how much information the
brain integrates after the flash for its decision,
we designed stimuli analogous to those in Fig.
1B but included a direction reversal. Immedi-
ately after the flash, the ring moves in one
direction and then it reverses direction after a
variable number of video frames (Fig. 2). If the
visual system only uses information from the
10 to 20 ms after the flash (as might be predict-
ed from Fig. 1, and from the latency difference
hypothesis), then the trajectory of the ring after
that time window should not affect the percept.
Contrary to that hypothesis, movement up to 80
ms after the flash influences the percept. We
find that 67 to 80 ms of unidirectional move-
ment is necessary to approach the illusory dis-
placement measured in Fig. 1. As the amount of
time before the reversal is reduced, the illusory
displacement is lessened, and with only 26 ms
before reversal, the flash-lag effect is effective-
ly canceled out (as though the ring were
stopped). With only one video frame remaining
before reversal,
the perceived displacement
changes direction (10). These data are consis-
tent with a temporally weighted spatial averag-
ing that takes place during the ;80 ms after the
flash. Physiological mechanisms for the spatio-
temporal filtering may involve a form of tem-
poral recruitment, the process by which motion
signals in the neural tissue are combined over
time (11). However, most of the available liter-
ature implicitly assumes that motion integration

R E P O R T S

would occur over the time before the flash, i.e.,
the visual system would collect information
until the time of the stimulus, with perceptual
processing following online. Our data indicate
instead that the visual system integrates infor-
mation after the flash, which necessitates that
perception be delayed. The direction reversal
experiment indicates that the position of the
moving object is interpolated as a point within
the integrated path, and given the results of Fig.
1, A and B, our interpretation is that the flash
serves to reset the motion integration.

To further examine our interpretation, we
next separated the temporal coincidence of the
flash and the moving object. A latency differ-
ence model assumes a “race” between a flash
and a moving object to a perceptual end point;
thus, we reasoned that giving the flash a tem-
poral advance should change the outcome of
such a race. Participants were instructed to ad-
just the angle of a “pointer” line (flashed for 13
ms) to point to the beginning of the trajectory of
the moving ring (Fig. 3). The pointer was
flashed and then the moving ring appeared.

variable outcomes
the
(cid:223)ash. (A) Participants reported
whether they perceived a (cid:223)ash
above or below the center of a
moving ring (forced choice). The
ring moved in a circular trajecto-
ry at a speed of 360¡ s—1. When
the ring reached the opposite
side, a (cid:223)ash (bright white disk)
appeared in a range that extend-
ed above and below the ring on
its trajectory, in 7¡ each direc-
tion. After the (cid:223)ash, one of three
conditions
followed: The ring
continued, stopped, or reversed.
Participants were instructed to
(cid:222)xate on a small square 1¡ to the
right of the (cid:223)ash location; how-
ever, eye (cid:222)xation was not mon-
itored, as the three conditions
were randomly interleaved to
obviate any predictive effects.
The initial trajectory of the ring
was mirrored in half the trials.
The same results were found
with repeated presentations of
the same trajectory (18), indicat-
ing that prediction does not ap-
pear to enhance or diminish the
perceptual effect. Symbols rep-
resent the average displacement
at which participants(cid:213) psycho-
metric curves crossed 50% (the
point of perceived alignment of
(cid:223)ash and ring). The thick line
marks the average for (cid:222)ve par-
ticipants 6 SE (19). (B) Same
paradigm as in (A), but here the ring and (cid:223)ash appear simultaneously on a blank screen. Results are
not signi(cid:222)cantly different from (A). The illusion is unchanged even if the ring is initially present and
set in motion after the (cid:223)ash, as opposed to simultaneous onset here.

is identical to Fig. 1B, except that

from Fig. 1B and represents the
perceived displacement when
the ring makes no reversal, e.g., it
simply moves counterclockwise
instead of starting clockwise and
then reversing.
