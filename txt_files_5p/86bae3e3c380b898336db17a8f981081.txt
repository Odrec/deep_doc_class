Fluorescence microscopy  

 Fundamentals of fluorescence imaging 

 Epi-fluorescence, confocal imaging and TIRF microscopy 

 Single molecule imaging, localization and tracking 

 Superresolution imaging  

- (Fluorescence) photoactivation localization (FPALM) 
- Stochastic optical reconstitution (STORM)

Optical resolution 

Definition 
 
The resolution limit d is a distance 
between two point-like objects.  
 
The resolution limit is reached, when the 
two objects can not be imaged as two 
distinct structures anymore.

If object structures move closer together, 
the resulting diffraction maxima will 
increasingly separate spatially.
