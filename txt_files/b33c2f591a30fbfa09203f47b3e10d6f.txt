Abstract

In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, a cortical region in the right temporo-parietal junction (RTPJ) is
recruited when participants read stories about people’s thoughts (‘Theory of Mind’). Both fMRI and lesion studies suggest
that a region near the RTPJ is associated with attentional reorienting in response to an unexpected stimulus. Do Theory of
Mind and attentional reorienting recruit a single population of neurons, or are there two neighboring but distinct neural
populations in the RTPJ? One recent study compared these activations, and found evidence consistent with a single
common region. However, the apparent overlap may have been due to the low resolution of the previous technique. We
tested this hypothesis using a high-resolution protocol, within-subjects analyses, and more powerful statistical methods.
Strict conjunction analyses revealed that the area of overlap was small and on the periphery of each activation. In addition, a
bootstrap analysis identified a reliable 6–10 mm spatial displacement between the peak activations of the two tasks; the
same magnitude and direction of displacement was observed in within-subjects comparisons. In all, these results suggest
that there are neighboring but distinct regions within the RTPJ implicated in Theory of Mind and orienting attention.

Introduction

In fMRI studies, a cortical region in the right temporo-parietal
junction (RTPJ) is recruited when participants read stories about
people’s thoughts, relative to controls for logical and attentional
demands [1,2]. The blood oxygen level dependent
(BOLD)
response in this region is significantly higher when participants
read about false beliefs than during closely-matched stories about
false maps or signs [3], and is specific to thinking about thoughts
relative to other social information [4–6].

Both fMRI and lesion studies also suggest that a region near the
RTPJ is involved in attentional reorienting. In a Posner spatial-
cueing paradigm [7], activity in the RTPJ is
increased on
‘‘invalidly-cued’’ trials, when a target appears in an unexpected
location [8]. Similar activation has been observed during detection
of centrally presented low-frequency targets [9], suggesting that
the function of this region is in exogenously-cued redeployment of
attention. Damage to RTPJ is the most common cause of left
hemifield spatial neglect [10,11].

One obvious question is: do these findings reflect recruitment of
a single neural region, common to both Theory of Mind and
exogenous attention, or are there neighboring but distinct regions
within the RTPJ that account for these results? The discovery that
these two tasks share a common mechanism would be surprising
and informative, suggesting that the two tasks rely on common
psychological component process.

Caution is clearly necessary before we accept an observation that
two different tasks activate the ‘‘same’’ brain region in imaging
studies as evidence that common psychological mechanisms are

engaged. In standard fMRI methods, the large voxel-size, along with
the combined effects of partial-voluming, pooling due to shared
vasculature [12],
imperfect alignment during normalization and
group averaging, and spatial smoothing all conspire to bias fMRI
analyses towards findings of spurious overlap [13].

Mitchell [14] recently conducted the first direct comparison of
the Theory of Mind and exogenous attention tasks in the same
individuals. He reported overlap between the regions of RTPJ
recruited by the two tasks. For the reasons described above, these
results are potentially important but hard to interpret. We
therefore investigated whether there is real overlap between
regions recruited for Theory of mind and attentional reorienting,
and/or whether there is a reliable spatial separation between the
regions activated by the two tasks, using higher field strength (3T
versus 1.5T) and higher resolution (1.661.662.4 mm voxels,
versus 3.7563.7566 mm) than the previous study. To overcome
the limitations of
the weak attention effect, we use a non-
parametric bootstrap to estimate confidence intervals for the
relative locations of the peaks in group data. The bootstrap is a
computationally intensive method for assessing the uncertainty in
a statistical measure [15].

sequence with TR = 2s, TE = 30 ms,

Runs of two experiments were interleaved in a single scan
session for each participant. In the Theory of Mind experiment,
subjects read 24 short vignettes about
the formation of a
representation (12 about beliefs [‘Belief’ trials], 12 about physical
representations like a photo, drawing, or map [‘Photo’ trials]) that
did not correspond to a reality [2,Figure 1a]. Stories were on
average 32 words long, and were presented for 10 seconds.
Subjects then answered a fill-in-the-blank question either about
the representation or about reality (4 seconds). Stories from the
two conditions alternated (order counterbalanced across subjects
and runs), with 12s rest interleaved between each story. Each run
lasted 2 min and 48 seconds (six stories); each subject participated
in four runs of this experiment.

The spatial attention experiment

followed the procedure
described by Corbetta [8], adapted from the Posner cueing task
[7]. Before each trial, the subject viewed a central fixation dot
flanked on either side by empty square boxes. At the start of a trial
the fixation dot turned green (Figure 1b), and was followed by a
cue arrow pointing to one side (left 50%, right 50%). The arrow
was followed in 44% of the trials by the appearance of the target (a
large asterisk) at the cued location (a ‘‘valid’’ trial), in another 16%
of the trials at the opposite location (an ‘‘invalid’’ trial), and in 20%
of trials, no target appeared (a ‘‘noise’’ trial). On the remaining
20% of trials, after the arrow appeared the central fixation turned
immediately back to red (‘‘cue’’ trial). Trials were separated by a
fixation interval of 9, 10 or 12 seconds (randomly distributed;
mean fixation duration 10 seconds). Trials
from the four
conditions (valid, invalid, cue, noise) were randomly intermixed.
Each run was comprised of 25 trials, and each subject participated
in 4 to 6 runs of the experiment. Subjects were provided an MR-
safe response box and instructed to respond with a single button
press as quickly as possible when a target appeared in either box
(effectively, a go/no-go task). This method isolates the effect of
‘‘invalid’’ trials to visuo-spatial attention; there is no response
conflict once the target has been detected.

Stimuli were presented onto a screen via Matlab 5.0 with an
Apple G4 powerbook on a dark background. Reaction time
measures were obtained during both experiments with the MR-
safe button box. Behavioral data for three subjects in the Theory
of Mind task were lost due to technical error.

fMRI data were analyzed with SPM2 (Wellcome Department of
Cognitive Neurology, London, UK). The images were motion
corrected, normalized to a functional template, and smoothed with
a Gaussian filter (FWHM = 2.5 mm) prior to analysis; during
normalizing, the functional data were resliced to 26262 mm.
Data were then high-pass filtered and modeled using a boxcar
regressor
for each
condition (Belief, Photo; Invalid, Valid, Cue, Noise). Contrasts
from each task (Belief-Photo, Invalid-Valid) were calculated for
each subject and then combined for group random effects
analyses. Surface reconstructions, for the figures, were constructed
for the group average results based on a standard single subject
anatomical.

An analysis of overlap between activations was conducted on
group random effects data using in-house software. Overlap was
calculated as a function of threshold on the voxel-wise T statistic
for the two contrasts. For the purposes of the overlap analyses, an
anatomical ROI was defined as a cube around the peaks from the
two group averages: [X 40:66; Y 273:241; Z 20:52]. Active
voxels were defined as any voxel passing the threshold in either
task that fell inside the anatomical ROI. Overlap was measured as
a strict conjunction: each voxel counted as ‘overlap’ only if the
contrast exceeded the T-threshold independently for both tasks.
Percentage overlap was defined as the percentage of active voxels
that were counted in the conjunction. For technical reasons, in the
bootstrap and individual subjects overlap analyses there was no
extent threshold applied, whereas in the group analyses used an
extent threshold of k.10; as a result the bootstrap analysis was
more likely to find overlapping voxels, and therefore provides an
upper bound on the true percentage overlap.

The spatial relationship between activations was assessed with a
repeated-sample random effects analysis using a non-parametric
