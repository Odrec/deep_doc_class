Abstract

This study examined the production and perception of English vowels by native Korean (NK) learners of
English on two occasions separated by about 1 year. A preliminary experiment revealed that NK adults
classiﬁed some pairs of contrastive English vowels using two different Korean vowels whereas other pairs
showed classiﬁcation overlap,
implying they would be difﬁcult for Korean learners of English to
discriminate. In two subsequent experiments, NK adults and children differing in length of residence in
North America (3 vs. 5 years; 4 groups of 18 each) were compared to age-matched native English (NE)
speakers. In Experiment 2, NK children were found to discriminate English vowels more accurately than
/
were elicited using a picture-naming task. Some vowels produced by NK children were heard as intended
signiﬁcantly more often than vowels produced by NK adults. Acoustic analyses revealed that NK children
produced signiﬁcantly larger between-vowel contrasts than NK adults but did not differ from NE children.

Taken together, the results suggested that although children are more successful than adults in learning the
phonetic properties of second-language vowels, they might continue to differ from age-matched native
speakers in certain respects as uncovered by the vowel discrimination test in Experiment 2.

1. Introduction

The notion that ‘‘earlier is better’’ with respect to second language (L2) speech learning is well
accepted (see Singleton, 1989 for a review). As discussed by Snow (1987, page 192), it is widely
believed that children are able to learn an L2 ‘‘quickly, automatically, effortlessly, and to a level
indistinguishable from that of native speakers’’ whereas L2 learning in adulthood is conceived as
something that is ‘‘slow, effortful, and often less than perfectly successful’’. The purpose of the
present study was to evaluate this view of adult–child differences in L2 speech learning. It did so
by examining the discrimination and production of English vowels by native Korean (NK) adults
and children who were learning English as an L2.

Most evidence that children are better able than adults to learn L2 speech is indirect, inasmuch
as it comes from studies employing a retrospective developmental design in which comparisons
are made between groups of adult participants differing in age of ﬁrst exposure to an L2.
Participants ﬁrst exposed to their L2 as children (‘‘early learners’’) typically show more native-like
performance than participants ﬁrst exposed to the L2 in late adolescence or adulthood (‘‘late
learners’’). Signiﬁcant early-late differences have been observed for the production and perception
of L2 consonants (e.g., Flege, Munro, & MacKay, 1995; Yamada, 1995; Mackay, Flege, Piske, &
Schirru, 2001), the production and perception of L2 vowels (e.g., Munro, Flege, & MacKay, 1996;
Flege, MacKay, & Meador, 1999a; Piske, Flege, MacKay, & Meador, 2002; Flege, Schirru, &
MacKay, 2003), and overall degree of foreign accent (e.g., Seliger, Krashen, & Ladefoged, 1975;
Oyama, 1976; Yeni-Komshian, Flege, & Liu, 2000).

Most studies just mentioned compared groups of adult immigrants who differed in age of
arrival (AOA) in a predominantly L2-speaking country. Given that chronological age was not
controlled, length of residence (LOR) was necessarily confounded with the participants’ AOA (see
Flege, 1998, for review). Also, the early learners had generally lived in an L2-speaking country for
many years at the time of testing. Thus, another limitation of a retrospective developmental
design is that it provides little insight into adult–child differences in early stages of L2 learning.
More direct evidence of adult–child differences in L2 speech learning could be obtained by
directly comparing adults to children. If children are really better able than adults to learn L2
speech, they should show greater improvement in performance than adults over time in a
longitudinal study. An effect of chronological age might also be obtained by comparing groups of
adults and children who differed in LOR. The traditional view of adult–child differences suggests
that children would show a greater effect of apparent time (i.e., show a greater effect of LOR)
than adults.

A review of the existing literature provides only partial support for the expectations just
outlined. One of the few direct adult–child comparisons in the literature is that of Snow and
Hoefnagel-Ho¨ hle (1978), who examined vowel discrimination and word production by native
English (NE) adults and 3–15 year-old NE children who were learning Dutch as an L2. The NE

ARTICLE IN PRESS

265

adults showed somewhat more native-like performance than the NE children did after 6 months
of residence in The Netherlands (T1), whereas the children tended to outperform the adults after
10–11 months of residence (T2).

The results obtained by Snow and Hoefnagel-Ho¨ hle (1977,1978) might be interpreted to mean
that the NE children were more successful than the NE adults in learning L2 Dutch. However,
there is reason for caution in reaching such a conclusion. The children were enrolled in Dutch
public schools where they needed to use Dutch for everyday activities, whereas the adults seldom
used Dutch because English is widely spoken by Dutch adults. The adult–child difference
observed at T2 might therefore be attributed, at least in part, to a greater opportunity and/or need
to use Dutch by the NE children than by the NE adults. Also, the discrimination and production
of phonetic segments in the native language changes during childhood (e.g., Flege & Eefting,
1986; Aoyama, Flege, Guion, Akahane-Yamada, & Yamada, 2004). Given that the NE adults
and NE children were not compared to age-matched groups of native Dutch participants, it was
therefore uncertain if the NE children’s performance was indeed more Dutch-like at T2 than that
of the NE adults.

In keeping with the traditional view of adult–child differences, research examining the
production and perception of L2 consonants has suggested that LOR may exert a somewhat
stronger inﬂuence on L2 performance for children than adults. Yamada and colleagues (Yamada,
Strange, Magnuson, Pruitt, & Clark, 1994; Yamada, 1995) observed a positive correlation
between LOR and the production and perception of /r l/ by young native Japanese (NJ) adults.
However, these results could not be interpreted with certainty because the participants’ LOR was
strongly correlated with their AOA in the US. Aoyama et al. (2004, under review) tested NJ adults
and children after 0.5 years (T1) and 1.5 years (T2) of residence in the US. The NJ children but
not adults showed a signiﬁcant improvement in discriminating English consonants from T1 to T2.
Both groups’ production of English liquids improved over the 1-year study interval, but the NJ
a
children showed more improvement than the NJ adults did (especially for /
/), and only the NJ
children showed an improved production of fricatives. It was noteworthy, however, that although
the NJ children showed evidence of greater learning than the NJ adults, they nonetheless differed
signiﬁcantly from NE children.

Williams (1979) tested native Spanish children who differed in chronological age (8–10 vs.
14–16 years) and LOR in the US (o 0.5 vs. 1.5–2 vs. 3–3.5 years). The identiﬁcation of synthetic
labial stops differing in voice onset time (VOT) was signiﬁcantly more English-like for children
with an LOR greater than 1.5 years than for children having an LOR less than 0.5 years. The
children with an LOR of 3–3.5 years tended to produce English /p/ with longer (and thus more
English-like) VOT values than did children with an LOR less than 0.5 years. However, even the
children who had lived in the US for more than 3 years produced /p/ with signiﬁcantly shorter
VOT values than NE children did.

Research examining overall degree of foreign accent has suggested that LOR effects may be
greater for children than adults. Flege and Fletcher (1992) observed signiﬁcantly milder foreign
accents for native Spanish adults having an LOR in the US of 14 than 1 year, whereas Flege
(1988) failed to observe a signiﬁcant difference between groups of Chinese adults having mean
LORs of 5 vs. 1 year. Oyama (1976) recorded young Italian adults who had arrived in the US by
the age of 15 years. No difference was found to exist between participants having LORs of 5–11
and 12–18 years. In a study by Asher and Garcı´ a (1969), English sentences produced by native

ARTICLE IN PRESS

Spanish children who arrived in the US prior to 13 years of age were classiﬁed ‘‘native’’, ‘‘near-
native’’, ‘‘slight foreign accent’’, or ‘‘deﬁnite foreign accent’’ by NE-speaking listeners. None of
the 56 children were judged to be ‘‘native’’. This ﬁnding, which agrees with the results of studies
employing a retrospective developmental design (e.g., Guion, Flege, & Loftin, 2000; Piske, Flege,
& MacKay, 2001; Yeni-Komshian et al., 2000), is not consistent with the traditional view of
children’s L2 speech learning ability. However, Asher and Garcı´ a (1969) obtained more ‘‘near-
native’’ classiﬁcations for children having an LOR of 5–8 than 1–4 years. And, more recently,
Aoyama et al. (2003) tested NJ adults and children 6–14 years of age after 0.5 and 1.5 years of
residence in the US. These authors found that the NJ children but not the adults were less foreign-
accented at T2 than T1.

The literature has not yet provided a comparison of the effect of LOR on adults’ and children’s
L2 vowel production and perception. No previous study, to our knowledge, has assessed the effect
of LOR for children. As for adults, Flege, Bohn, and Jang (1997) compared groups of nonnative
adults differing in L1 (Korean, Mandarin, Spanish, German) and LOR in the US (overall
means ¼ 1 vs. 7 years). Tokens of English vowels (/i/, /I/, /e/, /æ/) produced by the participants
with an LOR of 7 years were slightly more intelligible than vowels produced by the participants
with an LOR of 1 year; however, the LOR effect reached signiﬁcance only for /I/. (Similar results
were obtained in acoustic analyses.) Vowel perception was assessed by manipulating F1 frequency
in synthetic continua ranging from /e/-to-/æ/ and /i/-to-/I/. In most instances, the effect of the F1
manipulation was greater for the participants having a relatively long than short LOR.

The present study compared the discrimination and production of English vowels by NK
adults and children learning English in North America and age-matched groups of NE
speakers. The NK participants had all migrated from Korea to either the US or Canada. All of
them were living in predominantly English-speaking communities where English was needed
for everyday interactions. Half of the 72 NK participants were adults and half were children.
The NK adults and children, as well as the NE adults and children (n ¼ 18 each), were tested
on two occasions separated by about 1 year (T1, T2). To evaluate the effect of LOR, the NK
adults and children were subdivided into groups differing in LOR, yielding four NK groups of 18
each.

The effect of chronological age on L2 speech learning was evaluated in three ways. First, NK
groups differing in LOR (3 vs. 5 years) were compared. The traditional view of children’s L2
learning ability leads to the expectation that LOR differences would exert a greater effect for the
NK children than for the NK adults. Second, performance at T1 and T2 was compared. The
traditional view leads to the expectation that if the NK children had not already achieved a native-
like levels of performance at T1, they would show a greater improvement from T1 to T2 than the
NK adults would. Finally, the two groups of NK children and the two groups of NK adults were
compared to the NE children and NE adults, respectively. The traditional view leads to the
expectation that the NK adults but not children would differ from age-matched NE controls,
regardless of time of testing or LOR.

The study was organized as follows. Naturally produced English vowels were classiﬁed by NK
adults in Experiment 1 in order to determine which pairs of contrastive English vowels might
prove difﬁcult for NK participants to discriminate. Experiment 2 tested the discrimination of ﬁve
English vowel contrasts by the NK and NE participants. The Experiment 1 results suggested that
e
the NK participants would have difﬁculty discriminating /i/-/I/, /eI/-/e/, /e/-/æ/ and />/-/
/ but not

267

/i/-/>/ (because these last vowels would likely be heard as distinct Korean vowels by NK
speakers). A picture-naming task was used in Experiment 3 to elicit the production of English
words. Vowel production accuracy was assessed through phonetic classiﬁcation and acoustic
analysis.

2. Experiment 1

The purpose of this experiment was to identify four pairs of contrastive English vowels that
would likely be difﬁcult for the NK participants tested in Experiment 2 to discriminate, and one
other pair of English vowels that would be relatively easy for them to discriminate and thus could
serve as a control to ensure that the Experiment 2 discrimination task was understood.

It is generally agreed that nonnatives’ discrimination of L2 vowels depends importantly on how
the L2 vowels are classiﬁed with respect to vowels in their L1. For example, according to Best’s
Perceptual Assimilation Model (Best, 1993, 1995), instances of contrastive L2 vowel categories
that are identiﬁed as instances of a single L1 vowel category will be relatively difﬁcult to
discriminate whereas instances of contrastive L2 vowels that are mapped onto two different L1
vowels will be discriminated more accurately. The aim of this experiment, therefore, was to
determine how the English vowel tokens used in Experiment 2 would be classiﬁed in terms of
Korean vowel categories.

Korean is usually analyzed as having either eight vowels, /i e e ] e

u/ (Lee & Zhi, 1987;
Hong, 1988; Lee, 1993; Magen & Blumstein, 1993; Kang, 1996; Park, 1997) or ten vowels (if /y/
and /ø/ are included; see Yang, 1992, 1996; Sohn, 1999; Lee & Ramsey, 2000). The phonemic
status of Korean /e/ and /e/ depends on age (Hong, 1988; Park, 1997; Lee & Ramsey, 2000). Many
Koreans have only one phoneme in the mid-front region of the vowel space due to the
recent merger of /e/ and /e/ (caused by the raising of /e/, see Kang, 1996, and Lee & Ramsey,
2000).

Another on-going sound change in Korean pertains to vowel duration. Korean is traditionally
regarded as having phonological length distinctions (Lee & Zhi, 1987; Sohn, 1999; Lee & Ramsey,
2000), but such distinctions are disappearing (Magen & Blumstein, 1993; Park, 1997; Sohn, 1999;
Lee & Ramsey, 2000). This may increase the difﬁculty that NK learners of English have in
discriminating certain pairs of English vowels such as /i/ and /I/ because such vowels differ in
duration as well as vowel quality.

male NE speakers. Eight NE speakers produced /i I eI e æ > e

The English vowels examined here (and subsequently in Experiment 2) were produced by adult
u/ in a /b_bo/ context within a
carrier phrase. The /bVbo/ nonwords were digitized (22.05 kHz, 16-bit resolution) and normalized
for peak amplitude. All portions of the speech signal preceding release of the initial /b/ and
following complete constriction of the intervocalic /b/ were removed to control for unwanted
variation in portions of the stimuli other than the vowels of interest. The resulting /bVb/ stimuli
were then evaluated by four NE-speaking listeners (2 male and 2 female), who rated each token

ARTICLE IN PRESS

268

for goodness using a 5-point scale. The tokens selected as stimuli were the ﬁve tokens of each
vowel receiving the highest ratings. The selected tokens of all eight target vowel categories were
produced by ﬁve different speakers.

Table 1 presents the mean duration as well as the mean ﬁrst and second formant frequencies
(F1, F2 at the vowel midpoint) of the English vowels examined here. It is noteworthy that three
e
pairs of vowels that were adjacent in vowel space (/i/-/I/, /e/-/æ/, />/-/
/) differed in terms of
duration, and that one other pair of vowels that were adjacent in terms of midpoint formant
F1–F2 values, /eI/-/e/, differed in terms of degree of formant movement, as well (which is not
shown). Acoustic values have been published for Korean vowels (see, e.g., Yang, 1996), but not
for vowels produced in the context examined here (/b_b/), making direct comparison
inappropriate (see, e.g., Strange, Verbrugge, Shankweiler, & Edman, 1976).

2.1.2. Listeners
NK speakers (3 male, 5 female) with a mean age of 31.4 years (range ¼ 24–38 years) who had
lived only brieﬂy in an English-speaking country (range ¼ 6–11 months) participated. All
reported having normal hearing, and all had studied English in Korea (range ¼ 6–10 years).

2.1.3. Procedure

The participants were tested individually in a quiet room after completing a language
background questionnaire. Written instructions in Korean were given. The 40 stimuli (8 English
categories  5 tokens) described earlier were randomly presented ﬁve times each via headphones
at a self-selected comfortable level. The participants identiﬁed the stimuli in terms of one of the
eight vowels of Korean (/i e e ] e
u/) by clicking Hangul characters displayed on the computer
screen. The interval between each response and presentation of the next stimulus was 1 s. A
response was required for each stimulus. The participants were told to guess if uncertain. They
could replay a stimulus but not change a response once given. Twenty extra tokens presented for
familiarization at the beginning of the experiment were not analyzed.

2.2. Results and discussion

Table 2 shows the percentages of times, based on a total of 200 judgments (8 listeners  5
tokens 5 replicate judgments), that tokens of the eight English target vowels were classiﬁed as an
instance of each Korean vowel category. The results obtained here led us to infer that the NK
participants in Experiment 2 would have little or no difﬁculty in discriminating the /i/ stimuli from
the />/ stimuli, whereas they would experience some degree of difﬁculty in discriminating /i/-/I/,
e
/eI/-/e/, /e/-/æ/ and />/-/
/.

The /i/ and />/ tokens were unambiguously identiﬁed as instances of two different Korean
vowels, /i/ and /]/. This ﬁnding suggested that even though the English /i/ and />/ stimuli might
differ phonetically from Korean /i/ and /]/, NK learners of English will generate two different
phonetic codes when hearing English /i/ and />/. Accordingly, /i/-/>/ served as a control contrast
in Experiment 2 to verify that all participants understood the discrimination task and possessed a
working memory that was adequate for the task.

An inspection of the results in Table 2 suggested that the NK participants in Experiment 2
e
might have difﬁculty discriminating /i/-/I/, /e/-/æ/, and />/-/
/. The instances of one English vowel
in each of these pairs was consistently classiﬁed as a single Korean vowel. The ‘‘consistent’’
members of these pairs, /i/, /æ/ and />/, were classiﬁed in 86–100% of instances as Korean /i/, /]/
e
and /]/, respectively. The other members of these pairs—/I/, /e/ and /
/, respectively—were
classiﬁed in terms of multiple Korean vowels, including the Korean vowel associated with the
‘‘consistent’’ member of the contrast. For example, English /i/ was always classiﬁed as Korean /i/
X
while English /I/ was identiﬁed as Korean /i/ (32%) and also Korean /e/ (30%), /e/ (18%) and /
/
(12%).

the ‘‘overlap’’ of
classiﬁcations in a perception assimilation experiment (i.e., how often a single L1 category was
used for instances of contrasting L2 categories) might predict L2 discrimination accuracy (see also
Flege & MacKay, 2004). If so, then one might expect Korean learners of English to have little to

moderate difﬁculty in discriminating /i/-/I/ and /e/-/æ/ in Experiment 2. However, the partial
overlap responses seen here, as well as the inconsistency of responses for one member of each
contrast, suggested that /i/-/I/ and /e/-/æ/ would be more difﬁcult to discriminate than the control
contrast, /i/-/>/. Support for this inference was provided by Polka (1995), who reported that NE
adults had difﬁculty in discriminating a German vowel contrast that included a vowel they were
unable to relate consistently to an English vowel category. Also, previous studies have provided
evidence that NK adults have difﬁculty in identifying and/or classifying English /i/-/I/ and /e/-/æ/
(Flege et al., 1997; Ingram & Park, 1997).1

The NK participants examined here did not classify either the /eI/ or the /e/ tokens consistently
in terms of a single Korean vowel. Both vowels were mapped onto multiple Korean vowel
categories with a high degree of overlap, leading to the expectation of at least some discrimination
difﬁculty.

3. Experiment 2

The purpose of this experiment was to compare the discrimination of English vowels by NK
adults and children to that of age-matched NE adults and children. It examined the
e
discrimination of four English vowel contrasts (/i/-/I/, /eI/-/e/, /e/-/æ/, />/-/
/) that were likely
to be difﬁcult for Koreans to discriminate, and one other contrast (/i/-/>/) that was likely to be
easy for them to discriminate. The stimuli were the naturally produced /bVb/ tokens examined in
Experiment 1, all of which were judged by NE-speaking listeners as ‘‘good’’ instances of their
intended category. The participants were tested twice with an average 1.2 year-interval between
the two times of testing (T1, T2).

3.1. Method

3.1.1. Participants

A total of 108 participants were assigned to one of six groups (n ¼ 18 each). Seventy-two
participants were NK speakers who had immigrated to North America from Korea; the
remaining 36 were NE speakers. As summarized in Table 3, half of the NK and NE participants
were adults and half were children. The participants were recruited and tested at ﬁve different
locations in North America (25 at the University of Alabama at Birmingham; 22 at Stanford
University in Palo Alto, California; 22 at the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana; 21 at
the University of Texas at Austin; and 18 at York University in Toronto, Ontario) because it was
impossible to ﬁnd all of the participants meeting our selection criteria at a single location.

The NK participants were selected on the basis of chronological age and LOR. The NK
children were required to be between 9 and 17 years of age at T1, and the NK adults were required
to be between the ages of 23–41 years. Half of the NK participants had been living in North

1The perceptual assimilation results obtained differed somewhat from the results obtained by Baker et al. (2002) and
Troﬁmovich, Baker, and Mack (2001), probably due to a difference in the phonetic contexts in which the vowel stimuli
occurred, the participants, or both. Unlike the results obtained here, the NK participants tested previously
(Troﬁmovich et al., 2001 ; Baker et al., 2002 ) identiﬁed vowels making up the /> /-/
/ contrast in terms of two different
Korean vowels, suggesting little discrimination difﬁculty.

‘‘adult-NE’’ groups were matched in chronological age to the NK children and adults,
respectively.2

The NK children and adults differed in education and English use as well the two selection
criteria. All 36 NK adults had studied English at school in Korea before arriving in North
America (mean ¼ 9 years, range ¼ 5–13), but just seven NK children had done so, and then only
brieﬂy (range: 1–3 years). All 36 NK children were attending an English-speaking school in North
America when tested at T1. Few of the NK adults were attending school, but 26 of them had
received at least some university education in North America (mean ¼ 6 years, range ¼ 1–9). In
general, the NK children reported using English more often than the NK adults in various
situations, in particular, with friends.

3.1.2. Procedure

The participants’ perception of English vowels was assessed using a categorial discrimination
test employed in previous L2 research (Flege et al., 1999a; Guion et al., 2000; Flege, 2003a; Flege
& MacKay, 2004). The vowel stimuli, which were described in Experiment 1, were presented in

2It would have been desirable to recruit groups of NK children who were younger on average, and who represented a
narrower age range, but this was not possible given the LOR requirements and the desire to recruit individuals who had
arrived in North America at or after the normal age of entry into school (6 years) but prior to the age that is claimed by
some investigators to mark the end of a ‘‘critical period’’ for L2 speech learning (12 years according to Scovel, 1988; 15
years according to Patkowski, 1990).

triads via headphones at a comfortable level using a notebook computer. Each vowel contrast of
interest was tested by eight change and eight no-change trials. The results of Experiment 1
suggested that, for many NK learners of English, the two vowels making up the /i/-/I/, /eI/-/e/,
e
/e/-/æ/ and />/-/
/ contrasts would not reliably map onto two distinct Korean vowel cate-
gories. A premise underlying this study was that a high level of performance for these
contrasts would require the establishment of new phonetic categories for one or both English
vowels.

The inclusion of both change and no-change trials in the discrimination test used here was
motivated by the view that establishing a phonetic category will increase sensitivity to differences
between instances of the newly formed category and other L1 and L2 categories, and will also
reduce sensitivity to token-to-token variation within the newly formed category (see e.g.,
Liberman, 1957; Kuhl, 1980; Guenther, Husain, Cohen, & Shinn-Cunningham, 1999; Bosch et al.,
2000). The three vowel tokens presented in all change and no-change trials were spoken by
different talkers, and so were always physically, if not phonetically, different. The change trials all
contained an odd item out; these trials tested participants’ ability to distinguish vowels drawn
from two different categories. For example, a change trial testing /e/-/æ/ might consist of /e/2 /æ/1
/e/5 (where the subscripts indicate different talkers). The correct response for change trials was the
button (‘‘1’’, ‘‘2’’, or ‘‘3’’) indicating the position of the odd item out, which occurred with near-
equal frequency in all three possible serial positions. The no-change trials, which contained three
different instances of a single category (e.g., /æ/3 /æ/5 /æ/2 or /e/1 /e/5 /e/4), tested the participants’
ability to ignore audible but phonetically irrelevant within-category variation (e.g., in voice
quality). The correct response to no-change trials was a fourth button marked ‘‘NO’’.

To reduce the use of purely auditory information, the change and no-change trials testing all
ﬁve contrasts were presented in a single randomized block. The participants were required to
respond to each trial, and were told to guess if uncertain. A trial could be replayed, but responses
could not be changed once given. The inter-stimulus interval between the stimuli making up each
trial was 0.8 s and the interval between each response and the next trial was 1.0 s.

The 108 participants were tested individually in a sound booth or quiet room. A practice session
with feedback was carried out using /bub/ and /beb/ stimuli prior to the experiment proper.
Participants were required to respond correctly to at least nine of 10 practice trials before
proceeding to the experiment; all were able to do so within three presentations of the 10-item
practice block. The participants were told that feedback would not be provided during the
experiment. Five additional practice items, which were not analyzed, were presented at the
beginning of the experiment to acclimate the participants to the withdrawal of feedback.

In order to reduce possible effects of response bias, the dependent variable examined in all
analyses were A’ scores based on responses to both change and no-change trials (see Snodgrass,
Levy-Berger, & Haydon, 1985). These scores were based on the proportion of ‘‘hits’’ obtained for
each contrast (i.e., the number of correct selections of the odd item out in 8 change trials) and the
proportion of ‘‘false alarms’’ (i.e., the number of incorrect selections of an odd item out in 8 catch
trials).3 If the proportion of hits (H) equaled the proportion of false alarms (FA), then A’ was set
to 0.5. If H exceeded FA, then A’ ¼ 0.5+((H FA)*(1+H FA))/((4*H)*(1 FA)). However, if

3Four catch trials testing each contrast contained three physically different instances of one vowel, and the remaining

four catch trials contained three different tokens of the other vowel category.

FA exceeded H, then A’ ¼ 0.5 ((FA H)*(1+FA H))/((4*FA)*(1 H)). A score of 1.0 indicated
perfect sensitivity, whereas a score of 0.5 indicated a lack of phonetic sensitivity.

3.2. Results

3.2.1. Establishing experimental control

The results of Experiment 1 suggested that the NK participants, even those who had not
established new categories for English vowels, would generate two distinct phonetic codes when
listening to the vowel stimuli used to test the English /i/-/>/ contrast. Thus, all 108 participants
were expected to obtain high scores for this contrast provided they understood the instructions
and possessed an adequate working memory.

A preliminary ANOVA examining the scores for all six groups revealed that the effect of
[F(1,102) ¼ 3.8, ns] and did not enter into signiﬁcant
Testing Time was non-signiﬁcant
interactions with other factors. The scores shown in Fig. 1 have therefore been averaged over
T1 and T2. Here it can be seen that all six groups of participants obtained high scores for /i/-/>/.
The scores for this contrast range from a low of 0.96 for child-3 to 0.99 for adult-NE. Also as
expected, the NK participants obtained lower scores than the NE participants for the remaining
four contrasts. The adult-3 and adult-5 groups obtained the lowest scores overall. The child-3 and
child-5 groups obtained scores that were intermediate to the scores obtained by the NK adults, on
the one hand, and the two NE groups (child-NE, adult-NE), on the other hand.

In order to determine if experimental control was established, scores averaged over the two
times of testing were submitted to an ANOVA in which Group (6 levels) was a between-subjects
factor and Contrast (5 levels) served as a within-subjects factor. Both main effects as well as the
two-way interaction reached signiﬁcance [Group F(5,102) ¼ 40.1; Contrast F(4,408) ¼ 94.5;
G  C F(20,408) ¼ 8.2; all p-values o0.01]. The simple effect of Group was non-signiﬁcant for

The relatively high scores obtained for /i/-/>/ and the lack of a signiﬁcant effect of Group for this
contrast conﬁrmed that experimental control had indeed been established for all six groups,
including both groups of NK children. The results for /i/-/>/ will therefore not be discussed
further.

3.2.2. Effects of age and LOR

The scores obtained by the NK participants for the four English contrasts (/i/-/I/, /eI/-/e/, /e/-/æ/
e
, />/-/
/) were submitted to an ANOVA in which age (child vs. adult) and LOR (3 vs. 5 years)
served as between-subjects factors and Testing Time (T1 vs. T2) and Contrast (4 levels) served as
within-subjects factors. As in the preliminary analysis, the main effect of Testing Time was non-
signiﬁcant [F(1,68) ¼ 2.7, ns] and did not interact signiﬁcantly with any other factor. The main
effect of LOR was non-signiﬁcant [F(1,68) ¼ 2.6, ns], as were the LOR Contrast [F(3,204) ¼ 1.4,
ns] and LOR Age  Contrast interactions [F(3,204) ¼ 0.4, ns].

Fig. 2(a) shows that the NK children obtained higher scores than the NK adults did, but that
child–adult differences were greater for participants with an LOR of 5 than 3 years, resulting in a
signiﬁcant Age  LOR interaction [F(1,68) ¼ 3.9, p ¼ 0:05]. Simple effects tests revealed that the
NK children with an LOR of 5 years obtained higher scores than those with an LOR of 3 years
[F(1,34) ¼ 4.6, po0:05] whereas the effect of LOR was non-signiﬁcant for the NK adults
[F(1,34) ¼ 0.1, ns]. Scores were higher for the NK children than adults, both those having an LOR
of 3 years [F(1,34) ¼ 7.4, po0:05] and 5 years [F(1,34) ¼ 26.6, po0:01].
Fig. 2(b) shows that the NK children obtained higher scores than the NK adults did for all four
English vowel contrasts. The ANOVA yielded a signiﬁcant main effect of Age [F(1,68) ¼ 31.8,
po0:01] as well as a signiﬁcant Age Contrast interaction [F(3,204) ¼ 3.0, po0:05]. Simple

Given the assumption that between-contrast differences for the NK participants arose from
differences in how various English vowel stimuli mapped onto long-term memory representations
for Korean vowels (e.g., Best, 1993, 1995), one might have expected the same pattern of between-
contrast differences for the NK adults and children. To help understand the apparent discrepancy
e
involving />/-/
scores were submitted to an Age (child vs.

[Age F(1,34) ¼ 10.3, po0:01; Contrast F(3,102) ¼ 29.8, po0:01] as well as the two-way
interaction [F(3,102) ¼ 3.8, po0:05]. Simple effects tests revealed that the NE children obtained

remaining three contrasts [F(1,34) ¼ 1.2–6.4, ns]4 (see also Baker, Troﬁmovich, Mack, & Flege,

2002). This suggests that the ability of English monolinguals to discriminate />/-/
/ develops
e
slowly, either because the auditory difference between />/ and /
/ is less robust than the difference
e
between other pairs of English vowels, because input for />/ and/or /
/ is more variable than for
e
other vowels, or because relatively few words are distinguished by />/-/
/. Whatever the
explanation, the NE participants’ results suggest that some factor(s) other than cross-language
e
phonetic interference might have inﬂuenced the NK children’s performance for />/-/

/.

3.2.3. Native-nonnative differences

To determine which NK groups differed from age-matched NE speakers, one-way ANOVAs
were carried out to test for differences between the three groups of children (child-3, child-5, child-
NE) and the three groups of adults (adult-3, adult-5, adult-NE). Separate analyses were carried
out for each contrast. As summarized in Table 4, the effect of Group was signiﬁcant in all eight (2
age groups  4 contrasts) ANOVAs (Bonferroni po0:05). Tukey’s tests indicated that, for all four
contrasts, higher scores were obtained for the NE adults than for both groups of NK adults
(adult-3, adult-5), who did not differ from each other. The child-NE group obtained signiﬁcantly
higher scores than the child-3 group did for all four test contrasts, but higher scores than the child-
5 group for just two contrasts (/i/-/I/, /e/-/æ/). Also, the child-5 group obtained signiﬁcantly higher
scores than the child-3 group did for /eI/-/e/.

4Although the Time effect never reached signiﬁcance in preceding analyses, given the unexpected pattern of results
e
just for the /> /-/
/ contrast, we reexamined the discrimination scores for the NE participants. The NE children’s scores
showed greater improvement from T1 (mean ¼ 0.90) to T2 (mean ¼ 0.94) than the NE adults’ (means ¼ 0.98 at T1 and
0.99 at T2). However, an Age (child vs. adult)  Time (T1 vs. T2) ANOVA yielded signiﬁcant effects only for the main
effects [Age F(1,34) ¼ 10.9, po0.01; Time F(1,34) ¼ 4.2, po0.05]. A lack of signiﬁcant
two-way interaction
[F(1,34) ¼ 1.9, ns] suggests that the effect of Time was not unique to the NE children.

3.3. Discussion

The results obtained here showed that the NK children were better able to discriminate English
vowels than the NK adults. This ﬁnding, which agrees with the results of studies examining the
discrimination of L2 vowels by groups of adults differing in age of exposure to the L2 (Flege et al.,
1999a; Flege & MacKay, 2004), is consistent with the traditional view of children’s superior
ability to learn L2 speech. However, the NK children with an LOR of 3 years discriminated
English vowels less accurately than the age-matched NE children did. This ﬁnding does not agree
with the traditional view of adult–child differences, but it does agree with the results of studies
showing differences in the perception and processing of Catalan vowels by native speakers of
Catalan and native Spanish adults who were ﬁrst exposed to Catalan as young children (Pallier,
Bosch, & Sebastia´ n-Galle´ s, 1997; Sebastia´ n-Galle´ s & Soto-Faraco, 1999; Bosch et al., 2000; see
also Flege & MacKay, 2004).

The most important ﬁnding of this experiment was that the NK children with an LOR of 3
years obtained signiﬁcantly lower scores than the NE children did for all four English vowel
contrasts, whereas the NK children with an LOR of 5 years differed signiﬁcantly from the NE
children for just two of these contrasts. This ﬁnding, when taken together with the signiﬁcant
effect of LOR for the NK children, suggested that the NK children were in the process of learning
to perceive English vowels in a more native-like way. This evidence does not support the view that
children’s phonological representations become attuned to the language-speciﬁc characteristics of
their L1 by about the age of 2 years and will thereafter be ‘‘relatively unaffected by later
acquisitions in either the same or a different language’’ (Peperkamp & Dupoux, 2002, page 204;
see also Sebastia´ n-Galle´ s & Soto-Faraco, 1999, page 120).

4. Experiment 3

This experiment examined the production of the English vowels /i I eI e æ > e

/ by the same
individuals who participated in Experiment 2. English words containing the vowels of interest
were elicited prior to Experiment 2 in order to prevent exposure to the perceptual stimuli from

affecting vowel production.5 The participants’ vowel production was assessed via phonetic
classiﬁcation and acoustic analysis.

4.1. Speech elicitation

Twenty-one words were elicited three times each using a picture-naming task. Care was taken to
select picturable words that were likely to be familiar to all of the participants, including the NK
children. Achieving these criteria resulted in variation in consonantal context for the seven target
vowels (see Table 5).

A digitized token of each of the target words that had been spoken by an adult male NE
speaker was used as an auditory prompt during word elicitation. The auditory prompts were
presented via a loudspeaker as the picture representing each word appeared, in a random order,
on the screen of a notebook computer. The ﬁrst elicitation of the 21 target words will therefore be
referred to as ‘‘cued’’ productions. The target words were auditorily cued during the second and
third elicitations of the test words only when the participants could not say a target word after
seeing its picture. The words were recorded using a Sony (model TCD-D8) DAT recorder,
digitized (22.05 kHz, 16-bit resolution) and then normalized for peak amplitude.

The decision was made to examine just the ﬁrst elicitation of the target words because variation
existed as to whether the test words were or were not cued during the second and third elicitations.
We cannot rule out the possibility that the presence of a native-produced model augmented the
accuracy with which the NK participants produced the vowels examined here. It is possible, also,
that the NK children beneﬁted more from the auditory prompts than the NK adults did. This
might hold true, for example, if children exhibit a greater tendency (or ability) to imitate than
adults do.

4.2. Phonetic classiﬁcation

adult with training in phonetics. The use of a single listener necessarily limits the generalizability
of the results obtained here. However, to reduce the possibility of bias in the classiﬁcations, the
vowels to be judged were presented in a random order to the listener, who was thus unaware of
the identity of the speakers.
The 216 tokens of each word (108 participants  2 testing times) were randomly presented twice
in separate blocks. The listener’s two replicate classiﬁcations of each vowel token agreed in 87%
of instances, ranging from 81% for /I/ to 99.5% for /eI/. Vowel tokens that did not receive the
same classiﬁcation were randomly presented three times each to the same listener in a subsequent
session. The classiﬁcation receiving the majority of responses in the second session was the one
used in all analyses.
Confusion matrixes were created for the vowels spoken by each group at T1 and T2. The vowels
spoken by each group could be heard as intended a maximum of 54 times (18 participants  3
words). Of primary interest was how often the target vowels were heard as intended
(‘‘intelligibility’’). As shown in Table 6, much the same average intelligibility scores were
obtained for the NE children (mean ¼ 84% correct averaged over the two times of testing) and the
two groups of NK children (mean ¼ 83% correct, averaged over the two times of testing and
LOR). The NK children’s /I/s were misheard as /e/ in 19% of instances, their /e/s as /æ/ in 39% of
e
/s as />/ in 33% of instances, on the average. The NE children’s /I/s were
instances, and their /
e
also heard as /e/ (mean ¼ 27%) and their /e/s were heard as /æ/ (mean ¼ 45%), but their /
/s were
seldom heard as />/ (mean ¼ 6%).
As shown in Table 7, intelligibility scores were higher for the NE adults (mean ¼ 94% correct)
than for the NK adults with an LOR of 5 years (mean ¼ 66%) and those with an LOR of 3 years
e
(mean ¼ 69%). The NK adults’ /e/s and /
/s were misclassiﬁed in much the same way as vowels
spoken by the NK children. That is, the NK adults’ /e/s were heard as /æ/ (mean ¼ 66%) and their
e
/s were heard as />/ (mean ¼ 82%). However, the NK adults differed from the NK children for
/
high vowels. The NK adults’ /i/s were heard as /I/ in 37% of instances and their /I/s as /i/ in 17%
of instances whereas the NK children’s /I/ tokens were rarely misperceived as /i/. Flege et al.
(1997) reported a bi-directional confusion between /e/ and /æ/ by 20 NK adults living in the US.
The error rate for adults in that study was lower than that reported here for /e/ (mean ¼ 19%),
but higher than that reported here for /æ/ (mean ¼ 70%; see also Park, 1997). Note that the NE
participants’ /e/s (especially those of the NE children) were often misheard as /æ/. The /e/-/æ/
confusion may arise from a partial merger of these vowels in the speech of certain native speakers
of American English (see acoustic measures at vowel midpoint reported by Hillenbrand, Getty,
Clark, & Wheeler, 1995). We cannot exclude the possibility, however, that these confusions were
the result of the perceptual standards of the single NE-speaking listener who classiﬁed all tokens,
or a difference in the degree of articulatory difﬁculty in producing a contrast between /e/-/æ/ as
compared to contrasts between other pairs of English vowels.

Two analyses of the classiﬁcation data were undertaken. The aim of the ﬁrst analysis was to
determine if native-nonnative differences existed in the intelligibility scores obtained for the seven
target vowels. The number of times that each target vowel was heard as intended was determined.
The 14 intelligibility scores obtained for each participant (7 vowels 2 testing times) ranged from 0
when no vowel was heard as intended to 3 when the vowels in all three words were heard as intended.
The adults’ scores were examined in 14 one-way ANOVAs, one for each of the seven vowels at
both T1 and T2. The effect of Group (LOR-3, LOR-5, NE) reached signiﬁcance for four vowels at

4.3. Acoustic analysis

Age- and gender-related differences in vocal tract size affect the formant frequencies of vowels
(e.g., Peterson & Barney, 1952; Eguchi & Hirsh, 1969). Researchers have attempted to reduce such

ARTICLE IN PRESS

281

physiologically based acoustic difference through normalization (e.g., Disner, 1980; Yang, 1996),
but no technique appears to be completely satisfactory. The present study included participants
differing greatly in vocal tract size. We reasoned, therefore, that direct comparisons of the
formant frequencies in vowels produced by the six groups would be inappropriate. We decided,
instead, to compare groups in terms of the magnitude of between-vowel formant frequency
differences.

The classiﬁcation results obtained in the preceding section, as well as data reported by others
(Flege et al., 1997; Ingram & Park, 1997; Park, 1997; Tsukada et al., 2003), suggested that the NK
adults have difﬁculty in producing a perceptually effective contrast between English /e/ and /æ/.
Speciﬁcally, the classiﬁcation results suggested that when the NK participants erred in producing
English /e/, they tended to produce an [æ]-quality vowel; and when they erred for /æ/, they tended
e
to produce an [e]-quality vowel. The NK participants’ />/ and /
/ productions also tended to show
a pattern of bi-directional confusion. Their difﬁculty in producing effective distinctions between /
e
e/-/æ/ and />/-/

/ might, therefore, be characterized as one of vowel contrast reduction.

The pattern of errors in vowel production led us to examine the magnitude of formant
frequency differences between the two pairs of vowels which exhibited a pattern of bi-directional
e
confusion, /e/-/æ/ and />/-/
/. We decided against examining the magnitude of differences
between other pairs of vowels. The errors observed for /i/-/I/ and /eI/-/e/ were not bi-directional,
and thus did not afford the opportunity for a between-group comparison of vowel contrast
magnitude. For instance, if /e/ were misproduced as /æ/, it would result in an increase of acoustic
contrast between /eI/ and /e/.

4.3.1. Measurement techniques
The Kay Elemetrics MultiSpeech program was used to measure formant frequencies in 2592
vowel tokens (108 participants 4 target vowels 3 words 2 testing times). As mentioned
earlier (see Table 5), the target vowels were produced in diverse phonetic contexts. We therefore
examined vowels at their acoustic midpoint in order to minimize the effect of the differing
consonantal contexts.

The beginning and end of each vowel token was identiﬁed by inspection of wide-band
spectrograms and time domain waveforms. A 20-ms Hamming window was centered at the
acoustic midpoint of each token. The frequency of the ﬁrst three vowel formants (F1–F3) at this
location was estimated using the auto-correlation method of linear predictive coding (LPC)
analysis. Twenty-two LPC coefﬁcients were calculated for most tokens. Where they failed to
produce reliable formant frequency values, the number of LPC coefﬁcients was adjusted
accordingly. Usually, this involved using a higher number of coefﬁcients (e.g., 26 or 28) for vowels
produced by children. The same software was used to obtain estimates of fundamental frequency
ðf 0Þ. When spurious values were returned, f 0 was calculated manually on the basis of the inverse of
the average duration (in ms) of three glottal pulses.
The following procedure was adopted to quantify the magnitude of spectral differences between
e
each participant’s productions of /e/-/æ/ and />/-/
/. First, the formant frequency values were
converted from Hertz to Bark units using the procedure described by Syrdal and Gopal (1986).
Bark difference values were then calculated for each token. One set of values (B1   B0) indexed
vowel quality in a high-low dimension of the acoustic vowel space. The other set of values
(B2   B1) indexed vowel quality in a front-back dimension. Next, the mean Bark difference values

ARTICLE IN PRESS

282

obtained for the three tokens of each vowel were calculated. Finally, the Euclidean distance
between the mean Bark difference values representing the two vowels in each contrast was
calculated. The larger the Euclidean distance, the greater the magnitude of the frequency contrast
that was produced.

e
Given the pattern of bi-directional confusions noted for /e/-/æ/ and />/-/
/ and the larger
differences in intelligibility scores between the NE and NK adults than between the NE and NK
children, we expected to obtain smaller distance scores for vowels produced by the NK adults
than the NK children. The primary questions of interest, therefore, were whether signiﬁcant
differences would exist between the NE and NK children, and if the NK children’s distance scores
would differ as a function of LOR or time of testing.

4.3.2. Results

Fig. 3 shows the mean Bark distance scores obtained for the six groups for /e/-/æ/ (left panel)
e
and />/-/
/ (right panel). The NK children produced larger frequency contrasts between both
pairs of vowels than the NK adults did, but there was little difference between the NE children
and NE adults. Also, differences between the NE and NK children were smaller than those
between the NE and NK adults. Statistical analyses conﬁrmed that the NK adults produced
signiﬁcantly smaller between-vowel contrasts than the NE adults did. The analyses also showed
that the NK children produced larger contrasts than did the NK adults who were matched for
LORs, and that they did not differ signiﬁcantly from the NE children.
The Bark distance scores obtained for the two vowel contrasts were examined in separate Age

4.4. Discussion

As with the discrimination of English vowels (see Experiment 2), the NK children more closely
resembled the NE children than the NK adults resembled the NE adults. The effect of Age that
was obtained here for the NK but not NE participants probably cannot be attributed to
physiological differences in vocal tract size because adult–child vocal tract differences were likely
to have been comparable for the NK and NE participants.

Although this experiment did not reveal signiﬁcant differences in vowels produced by the NE
and NK children, a recent study (Flege et al., in press) showed that English sentences spoken by
the NK children received signiﬁcantly lower ratings (indicating the presence of detectable foreign
accents) than sentences spoken by the NE children did. Perhaps between-group differences in
vowel production would have been observed here if other parameters (e.g., extent or direction of
formant movement) had been examined in addition to the magnitude of acoustic distance at the
vowel midpoint. Although it would have been desirable to provide analyses of vowel duration (see
Kim, 1994), we did not undertake such analyses because the target vowels appeared in a variety of
contexts (see Table 5).

5. General discussion

As discussed in the Introduction, the traditional view of adult–child differences in L2 speech
learning suggests that children are rapid and successful learners whereas adults are slow and
imperfect learners (see discussion by Snow, 1987, page 192). Most previous research showing age
effects on L2 learning have focused on groups of adults who differed in their age of ﬁrst exposure
to the L2 (oftentimes, many years in the past). The aim of this study was to evaluate the
traditional view of adult–child differences by directly comparing adults and children who were in
the process of learning an L2.

Age effects on the perception of L2 phonetic segments shown in various studies (Yamada, 1995;
Flege et al., 1999a; Flege & MacKay, 2004) suggested that, in the present study, the NK children
would discriminate English vowels more accurately than the NK adults. This inference was

ARTICLE IN PRESS

284

K. Tsukada et al. / Journal of Phonetics 33 (2005) 263–290

conﬁrmed in Experiment 2. However, contrary to the traditional view of children as rapid and
perfect learners of L2 speech, the NK children with an LOR of 3 years were found to have
discriminated English vowels less accurately than the age-matched NE children did.

The production of English vowels was examined in Experiment 3. One analysis was based on
the classiﬁcations by a single phonetically trained observer. The NK adults’ vowels were found to
be signiﬁcantly less intelligible than the NE adults’ vowels, whereas the intelligibility scores
obtained for vowels spoken by the NK and NE children did not differ signiﬁcantly. The NK
children’s vowels were more intelligible than the NK adults’ in several instances. The magnitude
e
of formant frequency differences between English /e/-/æ/ and />/-/
/ were determined through
acoustic measurement. Analyses of these values yielded results that were similar to those
obtained in analyses of the classiﬁcation data. The NK adults produced smaller between-
vowel contrasts than the NE adults did whereas differences between the NE and NK children
were non-signiﬁcant. The vowel production results agreed with the results of previous studies
employing a retrospective developmental design (e.g., Oyama, 1976; Munro et al., 1996; Piske
et al., 2002).

Unlike the vowel discrimination results obtained in Experiment 2, the NK children were not
found to differ signiﬁcantly from the NE children in producing English vowels (either in terms of
intelligibility for the seven target vowels, or the magnitude of between-vowel formant frequency
e
differences for /e/-/æ/ and />/-/
/). Baker et al. (2002) reported that NK children with an LOR of
less than 1 year produced English vowels less accurately than NE children did. This earlier ﬁnding,
when taken together with the present results, suggests that differences in L2 vowel production
between native and nonnative children may largely disappear by the time nonnative children
reside in a predominantly L2 speaking environment for about 3 years. This inference needs to be
evaluated in future research comparing groups consisting of individuals with LOR ranging from
roughly 6 months to 4 years.

Although the pattern of results presented here are straightforward, interpretation of the results
are not entirely clear. A question of longstanding interest is why the NK children produced and
perceived English vowels more accurately than the NK adults. One possible explanation was
offered by Scovel (1988, 2000), who proposed that a critical period for L2 speech learning ends at
about the age of 12 years. On this view, the adult–child differences obtained in this study arose
from the fact that all of the NK adults began learning English after the end of a critical period,
whereas this held true for only some of the NK children.
To evaluate the possible effect of passing a critical period at the age of 12 years, we compared
the performance of the 12 younger NK children (mean age at T1 ¼ 10.5 years) to that of the 12
older NK children (mean age ¼ 15.6 years). The ‘‘pre-’’ and ‘‘post-critical period’’ groups did not
differ signiﬁcantly in LOR (means at T1 ¼ 3.6 vs. 4.2 years) [F(1,22) ¼ 1.7, ns]. The two groups
were not found to differ in terms of their average discrimination of English vowels in Experiment
2 [means ¼ 0.76 vs. 0.82, F(1,22) ¼ 1.1, ns] nor in the average intelligibility of the vowels they
produced in Experiment 3 [means ¼ 87% vs. 83%, F(1,22) ¼ 0.7, ns]. These results did not
support a critical period account of the adult–child differences observed here, at least not if the
critical period ends at about the age of 12 years as proposed by Scovel (1988, 2000).

If adult–child differences are not the result of the passing of a critical period, then what does
account for age effects on L2 vowel learning? We speculate that the age effects seen here and in
previous research (e.g., Baker et al., 2002) arise from age-related differences in how the L1 and L2

ARTICLE IN PRESS

285

phonetic systems interact, to age-related differences in input, or some combination of both
factors. It is likely that the NK adults’ L1 categories were more fully developed than the NK
children’s when L2 learning began (see e.g., Hazan & Barrett, 2000). Flege (1995, 1999a, 2003b)
hypothesized that the formation of new categories for L2 vowels and consonants becomes less
likely with increasing age. By hypothesis, as L1 categories develop, they become more likely to
block the formation of new L2 vowel and consonant categories. The presence versus absence of
new categories for L2 speech sounds may, in turn, account for the magnitude of native-nonnative
differences (see e.g., Flege & Eefting, 1987, 1988).

The NK children were likely to have received more input from NE speakers than the NK adults
had. Work by Jia and Aaronson (1999) suggests that immigrant children are more likely than
immigrant adults to become dominant in the L2 because they, unlike adults, are typically
immersed in an L2-rich environment. Flege, Yeni-Komshian, and Liu (1999b) found that NK
adults who arrived in the US prior to the age of 12 years used English more (and Korean less)
than NK adults who arrived in the US between the ages of 13–22 years did. Not surprisingly,
the NK children examined in this study reported using English more than the NK adults (see
Table 3).

Children are traditionally seen as being able to learn an L2 more rapidly than adults. Although
this may be true, it is important to note that the present study has not provided valid measures of
rate of L2 learning. Rate of learning by adults and children can only be compared if the groups
received identical input in a unit of time. Many factors are responsible for the slope of the curve
relating age of exposure to the L2 and performance in the L2. These factors may include cognitive
changes, amount and kind of education received during the study interval, and social and
motivational factors. As noted by Hakuta, Bialystok, and Wiley (2003), joining two disparate
data points in a time-performance space (e.g., for young children and middle-aged adults) tells us
little about the path between those points.

We did not observe signiﬁcant differences between groups of NK adults with LORs of 3 versus
5 years, nor signiﬁcant changes between T1 and T2. The lack of signiﬁcant differences for the NK
adults cannot be attributed to test insensitivity because differences were observed for the NK
children. In our view, the present results should not be taken as evidence that adults are incapable
of L2 speech learning. Learning effects might have been obtained, for example, if we had
examined NK adults who did not study English in Korea before coming to North America, if the
LOR-3 group were replaced with a group consisting of individuals with less than one year of
residence in North America, or if the LOR-5 group were replaced by individuals who were more
experienced in English. Baker et al. (2002) observed that NK adults with an LOR of 9 years
e
perceived and produced />/ and /
/ as accurately as NE adults. How much English-language
experience is needed to show signiﬁcant improvements in L2 performance, and the question of
whether the NK adults can ever match the performance of NE speakers needs to be further
evaluated in studies comparing groups having both more and less English-language experience
than the groups considered here (see e.g., Flege & Fletcher, 1992).

It is generally agreed that the relationship between production and perception is complex and is
affected by factors such as amount of L2 experience (e.g., Yamada et al., 1994; Llisterri, 1995). A
number of investigators have suggested that L2 acquisition recapitulates L1 acquisition in the
sense that perceptual development tends to ‘‘lead’’ development in segmental production (Flege,
1995; Rochet, 1995). The pattern of results obtained in Experiments 2 and 3 might be taken as a

ARTICLE IN PRESS

286

disconﬁrmation of this hypothesis, inasmuch as the NK children seem to have been more native-
like in their production than discrimination of English vowels. The present ﬁndings might be
taken as support for an alternative hypothesis, namely that L2 segmental production leads L2
segmental perception (e.g., Goto, 1971; Sheldon & Strange, 1982; Yamada et al., 1994). However,
there are several reasons for caution in concluding that production learning precedes perceptual
learning in an L2.

First, it is difﬁcult to directly compare the extent of native-like attainment in L2 production and
perception data. This is because the tests used to assess production and perception are inherently
incommensurable (e.g., Gass, 1984; Flege, 1999b). For example, the tasks used in Experiments 2
and 3 might not have evaluated productive and perceptual abilities with the same degree of
thoroughness.

Second, the tasks used in Experiments 2 and 3 to assess vowel perception and production might
not have been of equivalent difﬁculty for the NK participants. It is conceivable that the categorial
discrimination test in Experiment 2 was cognitively more demanding than the picture-naming task
used to elicit vowel production. Moreover, the use of auditory models to elicit production might
have allowed the NK participants to produce the English vowels more accurately than they
typically do.

identical phonetic contexts when examined in perception (Experiment 2) and production
(Experiment 3). It is not possible, therefore, to rule out a differing effect of phonetic context in the
two experiments (see e.g., Strange, Akahane-Yamada, Kubo, Trent, & Nishi, 2001; Bohn &
Steinlen, 2003). Secondly, previous research has suggested that the social consequences of errors
in production and perception might differ (e.g., Sheldon, 1985; Mack, 1989; Bohn & Flege, 1997).
For example, adults might feel more pressure to demonstrate ‘‘language loyalty’’ by speaking with
a foreign accent than children do. A similar social pressure might not exist for L2 vowel
perception, however.

In summary, this study revealed that the NK children resembled the age-matched NE speakers
to a greater extent than the NK adults did in both discriminating and producing English vowels.
The NK adults failed to show native-like performance for either vowel discrimination or
production. The NK children’s vowel production abilities largely matched those of the NE
children. However, the NK children with an LOR of 3 years differed signiﬁcantly from the NE
children in discriminating four pairs of English vowels and the NK children with an LOR of 5
years differed for two vowel contrasts. These results are consistent with the view that children are
more successful than adults in L2 speech learning, but may not be indistinguishable from native
children.
