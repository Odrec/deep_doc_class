Executive Summary

Over the past 50 years, international tourism has grown extraordinarily and it is now one of the most important industries in the 
world in employment creation and generation of foreign revenues. Tourism receipts for 2010 are expected to surpass the $851 billion 
registered in 2009. The World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) estimates that by 2020 there will be 1.6 billion international tourist 
arrivals  worldwide.  Africa  and  Asia — the  two  regions  with  the  most  least  developed  countries  (LDCs) — are  expected  to  see 
75  million  and  416  million  of  these  arrivals,  respectively.  Tourism  destinations  have  diversified  substantially  and  several  LDCs 
are witnessing phenomenal growth in tourist arrivals and expenditure. International arrivals in LDCs increased by an average of 
11 percent a year between 1990 and 2009. Tourism provides an important opportunity for LDCs to diversify their economies and 
integrate inclusive and pro-poor concerns into sectoral strategies. However, tourism development is not a panacea. The sector 
is  extremely  competitive  and  sensitive  to  external  shocks  ranging  from  economic  downturns  to  natural  disasters  and  political 
instability, although it does demonstrate strong resilience. 

This study sheds light on how LDCs can maximize pro-poor gains from tourism. It analyses LDCs’ tourism development aspirations 
as set out in the Diagnostic Trade Integration Studies (DTIS) that were completed under the Integrated Framework for Trade-Related 
Technical Assistance to Least Developed Countries (IF). The DTIS encompass a comprehensive review of LDCs’ trade constraints, 
trade potential and the priority actions required to meet trade development needs in the overall context of national development 
and poverty reduction programmes. The DTIS represent a unique source of information on LDCs because they combine robust 
macroeconomic  and  sectoral  analysis  with  stakeholder  consultations  and  a  participatory  validation  processes. Thirty-five  DTIS 
were conducted between 2001 and 2009. Of these, 30 (86 percent) include a specific section dedicated to tourism with prioritized 
recommendations in an action matrix.

Most of the DTIS with tourism sections are not entirely successful in pointing the way toward scaled up and inclusive tourism 
development responses. Nonetheless, the presence of a tourism section or chapter is a reliable indication that the sector is a priority 
for the government and country as a whole. This is an important message for the development community, especially in view of the 
low priority traditionally assigned to the tourism sector in development cooperation. 

The analysis

This  study  analyses  the  30  DTIS  that  prioritize  the  tourism  sector.  The  analysis  is  country-specific,  focusing  on  three  levels  of 
interventions: policy and regulatory framework, institutional support and supply-side (enterprise) response. The analysis includes 
endogenous factors relevant for tourism development, such as capacities, supply chains, social and environmental sustainability, 
among others. These factors are grouped into 13 criteria, six of which are used as proxies for the poverty reduction orientation of 
the DTIS.

The first analytical step involved the extraction of details (in the form of actual narrative) from each DTIS. In the second step, these 
‘occurrences’ were inserted into a matrix that visually reveals the adherence of the DTIS to the 13 criteria at the three intervention 
levels.  In  the  third  step,  a  composite  matrix  was  created  that  summarizes  the  30  individual  country  matrices.  This  allows  for 
cross-country  comparison.  The  fourth  step  was  to  summarize  the  country  matrices  and  the  comparative  matrix  and  derive 
recommendations.

The analysis indicates that the DTIS focus significantly more attention on policy planning than institutional development. Supply-
side/enterprise issues also receive considerable attention. There are far more policy occurrences across the DTIS than occurrences 
dealing with institutional support arrangements. Recommendations concerning enterprise issues fall between these two extremes. 

This finding highlights the risk of over-reliance on enterprise, particularly inward investment and short-term measures, rather than 
prioritising interventions that enhance sustainability and inclusiveness. Policy statements on pro-poor strategies and provisions are

rarely supported with suitable implementation arrangements. This is a recipe to entrench the enclave character of tourism in many 
of the countries surveyed. 

Conclusions and recommendations

Tourism is a diverse and labour-intensive industry that provides a wide range of employment opportunities. Tourism is well placed 
to contribute to poverty reduction: because it is consumed at the point of intervention, even low-skilled workers in remote areas 
can become tourism exporters. However, converting comparative advantages into competitiveness and sustainability require not 
only a coherent policy framework and a dynamic private sector but also efficient institutions to translate policy measures into 
programmes. Additionally, a national tourism development strategy inevitably involves issues that extend far beyond the sector 
into  cross-sectoral  linkages.  Integration  within  global  tourism  networks  and  practical  actions  to  establish  linkages  with  other 
sectors of the economy and along tourism value chains are key elements of pro-poor tourism development. This wider perspective 
is essential if tourism development is to positively affect inclusion and poverty reduction.

Governments  must  be  aware  of  the  impacts  of  different  forms  of  tourism  development  and  promote  growth  models  with 
assumptions and implications that are fully understood. A pro-poor tourism approach entails targeted support programmes and 
increased community participation. 

Countries must do more to address pro-poor concerns, gender issues and sustainability considerations in tourism development. 
Occurrences of the six criteria that were used as proxies for poverty reduction and inclusion indicate serious gaps in about half the 
DTIS examined. To overcome these shortcomings, the following considerations should be taken into account:

• 

• 

The DTIS should provide more detailed analysis of tourism development’s impact on poverty reduction and 
opportunities for inclusion, particularly for communities located close to tourism establishments.

The lack of institutional backstopping in relation to the six core criteria or proxies indicates that a major effort is 
required to incorporate and internalize pro-poor objectives within public agencies and programmes.

•  More  information  on  gender  participation  in  the  tourism  sector  is  needed  to  identify  concrete  actions  for 

reducing participation gaps. The DTIS were particularly disappointing on this issue.

• 

The DTIS performed well in showing how to better connect vocational training and skill upgrading efforts with 
local employment opportunities.

•  While  the  DTIS  underscore  the  importance  of  social  and  environmental  sustainability,  they  do  not  provide 
adequate information on ensuring the participation of local communities in the development and management 
of tourism development interventions. 

•  Appropriate  forms  of  tourism  development  and  preservation  of  environmental  and  cultural  assets  should 
proceed hand-in-hand. LDCs’ most valuable assets are their immense natural and cultural resources. The DTIS 
are inconsistent in addressing how these assets should be preserved for future generations. More importantly, 
climate change issues and innovations in green technologies and architecture do not feature in DTIS discussions.

• 

Security and political stability, while only partially referenced by most DTIS, are key factors in building a positive 
country  image  and  attracting  foreign  and  domestic  investment  for  tourism  development.  For  post-conflict 
countries, the perception of risk might be disproportionate to actual conditions in the country. Countries must 
adequately address this issue. Security is a fundamental prerequisite for tourism.

Tourism and Poverty Reduction Strategies in the Integrated Framework

ExECutivE Summary

• 

• 

• 

The  DTIS  do  not  pay  sufficient  attention  to  quality  and  (national  or  international)  standards.  A  systematic 
approach  toward  building  a  client-oriented  culture,  supported  by  industry  and  labour  standards  and 
monitoring and compliance systems, is lacking. 

The tourism sector requires a wide spectrum of skills although it also provides opportunities for the unskilled. 
The need for training and skill development through domestic providers and in partnership with global chains 
or regional vocational centres is critical and requires more emphasis.

The tourism sector is sensitive to various external shocks. The 2007–2009 global recession is a case in point. 
Contingency  considerations  for  dealing  with  shocks  do  not  feature  strongly  in  the  DTIS.  Different  tourism 
products and source markets might mean different levels of resilience toward external shocks.

•  While  many  LDCs  are  competitors  in  the  tourism  market,  cooperation  is  also  possible.    Tourism’s  regional 
dimensions are clear in the DTIS of Mozambique and other Southern African Development Community (SADC) 
countries that established a regional organization mandated to promote tourism. Future DTIS should focus 
additional attention on this issue.

Under the Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF), a number of countries will prepare DTIS updates, and new entrants will undertake 
diagnostic  exercises.  DTIS  preparations  should  highlight  pro-poor  measures,  which  can  have  a  positive  impact  on  human 
development. Analysis and recommendations should not only focus on increasing overall competitiveness and productivity but 
also on promoting sustainability and inclusion. Intuitively, tourism development is expected to help fight poverty but the link is 
neither automatic nor straightforward. Gender, income generation, employment, and opportunities for youth must be taken fully 
into account. There is much room for improvement in future DTIS.

introduCtion

Over the past 50 years, international tourism has grown at an extraordinary rate. It is now one of the most important industries 
in the world in terms of employment creation and generation of foreign revenues. International tourism recovered faster than 
anticipated from the impacts of the global financial crisis and economic recession of 2007 to 2009: in 2010, there were 935 million 
international  tourist  arrivals  worldwide.  This  represents  an  increase  of  58  million  (6.7  percent)  from  2009  and  an  increase  of 
22 million (2.4 percent) from the pre-crisis peak in 2008. International tourism receipts for 2010 will likely surpass the $851 billion 
registered in 2009. Approximately $2.3 billion per day was spent worldwide on tourism activities in 2010. In 2011, global tourism 
is expected to grow at a rate of 4 to 5 percent. The World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) estimates that by 2020 there will be 
1.6 billion international tourist arrivals worldwide. Seventy-five million of these will occur in Africa and 416 million in Asia — the two 
regions with the great number of least developed countries (LDCs). Additional data on recent trends in the global tourism sector is 
presented in Annex 1.

While developed economies remain both the major tourism destinations and source of international tourism, developing countries 
are quickly catching up. In recent decades there has been a substantial diversification in international tourism destinations, and 
several LDCs have registered phenomenal growth in tourist arrivals and expenditure. International arrivals in LDCs increased by 
an average of 11 percent a year between 1990 and 2009. This trend is likely to continue, indicating that LDCs will be among the 
major players in international tourism in the coming years. Tourism growth rates in developing countries now outperform those in 
developed economies. International institutions and national governments increasingly recognize the potential for tourism to play 
a significant role in the socio-economic development of LDCs.

Tourism provides an important opportunity for LDCs to combat poverty, diversify their economies and pursue pro-poor inclusive 
growth strategies. The growing market trend of tourists seeking cultural and natural attractions in rural areas gives LDCs a strong 
comparative advantage. This trend is particularly relevant to LDCs since three quarters of people in extreme poverty live in rural 
areas.

Tourism  is  better  placed  than  many  sectors  to  address  the  needs  of  the  poor.  Because  tourism  is  consumed  at  the  point  of 
intervention, even low-skilled workers in remote areas can become tourism exporters. Tourism is a diverse and labour-intensive 
industry and provides a wide range of employment opportunities. Tourism employs more women and young people than most 
industries,  resulting  in  increased  incomes,  empowerment  and  social  inclusion.  Tourism’s  capacity  to  generate  employment  is 
particularly important in LDCs given the overall low level of education and skills among local populations. As an industry where 
entry  barriers  can  be  low  or  easily  lowered,  tourism  creates  opportunities  for  small  entrepreneurs  and  allows  poor  people  to 
establish new activities or formalize existing micro-ventures. 

Taxes and levies on tourism income can be used by governments for poverty reduction purposes. Tourism requires relatively less 
investment  (it  uses  readily  available  natural  and  cultural  attractions)  than  other  industries  and  the  requisite  infrastructure  and 
superstructure can benefit both tourists and local populations. Tourism is also one of the few sectors with a wide range of upstream 
and downstream effects on other economic activities, due to its large and diversified supply chain. Finally, tourism provides an 
opportunity to support traditional lifestyles and maintain traditional architectural and building styles. Tourism is a powerful engine 
for socio-economic development and an instrument to safeguard biodiversity and cultural heritage, especially in LDCs.

Table 1 provides an overview of the status of tourism in LDCs, measured by the contribution of the sector to foreign exchange 
earnings.

Tourism development is not a panacea for LDCs. The sector is extremely competitive and vulnerable to external negative impacts 
(natural and human-made), although it does demonstrate strong resilience. LDCs have weak capacities, which impact all aspects 
of tourism development, including planning, legislation, accessibility, marketing and promotion, product development, standards,

investment, heritage conservation and preservation. It is essential that tourism-related policies and measures are in place to ensure 
pro-poor benefits and respond to the imperatives of sustainability and competitiveness. 

Understanding the tourism value chain is the key to unlocking this challenge. It is vital for policy makers to design and implement 
policies that will maximize the realization of potential gains along the tourism value chain. In particular, policies and strategies are 
required to enhance the participation of the poor both in employment and income generating activities since the indirect impact 
of hotels and resorts in the host economy often brings the highest benefits. While the poor can aspire to direct employment in the 
tourism sector, the development of related subsectors such as transportation, restaurants, construction, leisure, heritage, arts, craft, 
tours, as well as fishery, agricultural and horticultural production can act as multipliers. Figure 1 presents an overview of the tourism 
value chain and related subsectors.

The study

The Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Report 2009 © 2009 World Economic Forum

To shed light on how LDCs can maximize pro-poor gains from tourism, this study analyses LDCs’ tourism development patterns 
revealed in the Diagnostic Trade Integration Studies (DTIS) carried out under the Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical 
Assistance to Least Developed Countries (IF). 1 The IF is a multilateral programme to support LDCs’ trade development. DTIS evaluate 
country-specific trade constraints, trade potential and the priority actions required to meet trade development needs in the overall 
context  of  national  development  and  poverty  reduction  programmes.  Following  a  robust  participatory  process,  the  primary 
stakeholders from the private sector and civil society validate the DTIS. The DTIS is then formally adopted by the government as a 
main pillar of trade and development policy to support economic growth and poverty reduction strategies. The DTIS thus provide 
both an assessment of the status of trade in a particular country and a set of prioritized recommendations. 2

Thirty-five countries conducted DTIS between 2001 and 2009. Of these, 30 (86 percent) included a specific section dedicated to 
tourism (see Annex 2). The presence of a tourism section or chapter in a DTIS is a reliable indication that the development of the 
tourism sector is a national priority. The recommendations in the DTIS action matrix detail the prioritized interventions to be pursued 
by the government. The matrix also highlights areas that require the support of development partners to achieve results. The analysis

is country-specific and accounts for endogenous factors relevant to tourism development, such as transport infrastructure and 
services, capacities, backward business linkages, country image, marketing strategy, and social and environmental sustainability.

Tourism and Poverty Reduction Strategies in the Integrated Framework for Least Developed Countries explores how LDCs can maximize 
pro-poor gains from their tourism sectors. It is organized into five chapters. Following the Introduction in Chapter 1, Chapter 2 
describes the study’s analytical framework and methodology. Chapter 3 presents the main findings. Chapter 4 provides further 
observations on the main findings. Chapter 5 advances recommendations for LDCs, including how to approach the analysis of 
tourism development from a pro-poor perspective in the next generation of DTIS or DTIS updates. 

The findings of this study are intended to provide a basis for deliberations at a forum organized under the umbrella of the Steering 
Committee on Tourism for Development (SCTD) 3 by UNDP in partnership with the UNWTO, International Labour Organization (ILO), 
International Trade Centre (ITC), United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the World Trade Organization 
(WTO) and the Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF) Secretariat at the 4th United Nations Conference on Least Developed Countries 
(LDC IV) in Istanbul, Turkey in May 2011. 4

This study analyses the extent to which the DTIS focus on maximizing tourism sector gains in a manner that is competitive and 
sustainable and yields pro-poor benefits. 5 The UNWTO defines sustainable tourism as tourism that takes full account of its current 
and future economic, social and environmental impacts, addressing the needs of visitors, the industry, the environment and host 
communities. Sustainable tourism development guidelines and management practices are applicable to all forms of tourism in all 
types of destinations, including mass tourism and the various niche tourism segments. 

The transmission channels through which the poor can benefit directly or indirectly from tourism development are illustrated in 
Box 1, which outlines seven ‘sustainable tourism-eliminating poverty’ (ST-EP) mechanisms.

Methodology

The methodology followed in this study evaluates the DTIS on three levels of intervention: policy, institutions and supply side 
(enterprise). The methodology is specific to the present study; it is not normally applied in the preparation of a DTIS. 

Intervention  on  each  level — policy,  institutions  and  supply  side — plays  a  significant  role  in  the  development  of  the  tourism 
sector.  Policy  interventions  alone  cannot  translate  private  sector  initiatives  and  investments  into  actual  supply  capacities:  the 
corresponding institutional set-ups, implementation and coordination mechanisms are equally important. The three-level analysis 
is essential to assess whether the recommendations in the DTIS are consistent with pro-poor objectives.

The study’s three-level analysis is complemented by the application of a common set of criteria that are important drivers in the 
development of the tourism sector. There are 13 criteria in total and they all draw upon endogenous factors. An elaboration of the 
three levels of intervention and the 13 complementary criteria follows.

3  In 2010 the Steering Committee on Tourism for Development was established under the aegis of UNWTO to coordinate the tourism-related work 

of UN agencies.

BOX 1: HOW TOURISM CAN BENEFIT THE POOR – THE ST-EP SEVEN MECHANISMS

1. Employment of the poor in tourism enterprises

This  mechanism  involves  undertaking  measures  to  increase 
employment  in  tourism  enterprises.  It  is  important  that  the 
provision of education and training is strengthened so that the 
poor may respond to employment opportunities, and any social 
or cultural barriers are eliminated.

2.  Supply  of  goods  and  services  to  tourism  enterprises  by 
the poor or by enterprises employing the poor

One  of  the  fundamental  conditions  to  achieving  poverty 
reduction  is  to  ensure  that  as  much  as  possible,  goods  and 
services  in  the  tourism  supply  chain  come  from  local  sources 
at  all  stages.  The  objective  is  to  maximise  the  proportion  of 
tourism spending that is retained in local communities and to 
involve the poor in the supply process. This also helps to support 
traditional forms of rural activities and skills, enhance the quality 
and  identity  of  the  local  tourism  product  and  establish  stable 
sources for business.

3. direct sales of goods and services to visitors by the poor 
(informal economy)

One of the main ways in which poor people seek to earn income 
from  tourists  is  through  selling  produce  and  services,  such 
as  fruits,  handicrafts  or  guided  tours,  directly  to  them. Where 
visitors engage in the informal economy, it can be a direct route 
to providing income to the poor, and it can provide visitors with 
a  colourful  and  rewarding  experience.  Information  provision 
to  tourists  on  available  local  products  is  important,  as  well 
as  training  to  local  people  to  ensure  their  products  meet  the 
quality requirements of visitors.

4.  Establishment  and  running  of  tourism  enterprises  by 
the  poor  -  e.g.  micro,  small  and  medium  sized  enterprises 
(mSmEs), or community based enterprises (formal economy)

level.  These  may 

This  involves  the  establishment  and  management  of  formal 
tourism  enterprises  by  the  poor,  either  individually  or  at 
a  community 
include  accommodation 
establishments,  catering,  transport,  retail  outlets,  guiding  and 
entertainment. Advantages of enterprise formation at the local 
level are that it places power and control in the hands of the local 
people, it can guarantee investments for the longer term and it 
enables enterprises to establish a scale of operation needed to 
attract customers.

5. tax  or  levy  on  tourism  income  or  profits  with  proceeds 
benefiting the poor

This  mechanism  relates  to  the  revenues  that  are  earned  by 
national  or  local  government  from  tourism,  which  can  be 
used to fund social programmes. It has the advantage that all 
of  the  poor  can  benefit  from  tourism  without  being  directly 
engaged in the sector. The extent to which state revenue earned 
from  tourism  is  put  towards  poverty  reduction  will  depend 
on  national  priorities  and  programmes.  Taxes  or  levies  raised 
locally,  for  example  through  levies  on  bed-nights  or  entrance 
fees  for  protected  areas,  can  often  be  used  fully  or  partly  for 
community  benefits.  Transparency  in  the  application  of  local 
taxes is essential, as well as consultation with the private sector 
to  avoid  deterring  the  industry  and  travellers  by  imposing 
relatively high taxation levels.

6.  voluntary  giving/support  by  tourism  enterprises  and 
tourists

Voluntary  support  in  money  or  in  kind,  given  by  visitors  or 
tourism  enterprises  to  the  poor  can  act  as  influential  drivers 
for  local  poverty  reduction. Various  studies  have  pointed  to  a 
willingness amongst tourists to give something back to the area 
they are visiting. Many tourism enterprises are also committed 
to  provide  sponsorship  to  development  initiative  in  the  areas 
where  they  operate.  Local  NGOs  or  trusts  may  help  develop 
mechanisms  for  the  collection  and  distribution  of  donations. 
Beneficiary  schemes  clearly  showing  tangible  local  impact 
and community involvement have a high chance of attracting 
sponsorship and visitor support.

7.  investment  in  infrastructure  stimulated  by  tourism  also 
benefiting  the  poor  in  the  locality,  directly  or  through 
support to other sectors

Tourism  development,  particularly  in  a  new,  remote  or  rural 
location, can include investment in new infrastructure, such as 
roads, water and energy supply, sanitation and communications. 
With careful planning, such infrastructure can also bring positive 
benefits to the poor, by providing them with basic services and 
opening up new and faster routes to access markets. The main 
challenge  is  to  make  sure  that  new  tourism  development  is 
not consuming resources at the expense of local communities, 
but  rather  offering  them  the  chance  to  gain  new  access  to 
infrastructure.

Tourism and Poverty Reduction Strategies in the Integrated Framework

Levels of intervention

•  Policy and regulatory framework. Policy makers set the stage for tourism development through appropriate 
regulatory regimes, such as simple tourism arrival requirements or policies that facilitate investments (domestic 
and foreign). To achieve the objective of poverty reduction, government policies must leverage opportunities 
to  promote  employment  and  other  income  generating  activities,  and  ensure  that  local  enterprises  are 
competitive.  A  participatory  process  involving  stakeholders  from  civil  society  and  the  public  and  private 
sectors fosters adherence to the policy and commitment to its implementation. Particularly in the LDC context, 
it is imperative to identify the bottlenecks and challenges. An analysis of the DTIS from a policy perspective will 
reveal the overriding issues that require follow-up action through a coherent national approach.

• 

institutional  set-up.  A  supportive  institutional  infrastructure,  ranging  from  banks  to  hotel  accreditation, 
tourism promotion, marketing boards, MSME support, and food safety regulation, plays an important role in 
tourism development by providing the means of implementing and coordinating policies that directly benefit 
tourism  enterprises.  If  institutional  mechanisms  are  absent,  inadequate,  or  lack  capacity — a  perennial  LDC 
challenge — the  policy  framework  cannot  be  fully  realized.  Close  consultation  and  collaboration  between 
the government and the private sector and other stakeholders is required to facilitate the functioning of a 
supportive  institutional  infrastructure.  Certain  institutional  arrangements  such  as  tourism  promotion  and 
marketing boards may be established as public-private partnerships.

•  Supply  side/enterprise.  Governments  can  establish  enabling  policy  and  institutional  frameworks,  but  the 
burden of carrying through with these measures and achieving increasing levels of competitiveness rests with 
the private sector, enterprises and workers. Dynamic and proactive enterprises with linkages in local and global 
markets are critical if tourism is to contribute to welfare gains and inclusion. The backward linkages established 
by foreign direct investment (FDI) are one of the channels through which local communities can benefit from 
tourism development. Domestic investment can be an equally important driver of tourism development. The 
supply response also depends on available assets, which might belong to enterprises, communities or the state 
and include natural and cultural resources. Enterprise capacity, particularly of MSMEs and the informal sector, is 
another major challenge in the LDC context.

Criteria and their rationale

Complementing  the  three  levels  of  analysis  is  a  set  of  13  criteria  that  are  relevant  for  achieving  a  competitive  and  sustainable 
tourism industry. Of the 13, six are ‘core issues’ in the contribution of tourism development to addressing pro-poor concerns and 
poverty reduction. The use of these six criteria as proxies for poverty reduction concerns can only provide a rough indication of 
the extent to which pro-poor interventions and considerations are integrated into the DTIS tourism discussion. The six proxies also 
do not necessarily provide a basis for the prioritization or sequencing of interventions. In some countries, investing in key tourism 
infrastructure  and  addressing  security  considerations  are  essential  preconditions  for  pro-poor  development  interventions  that 
bring lasting results. Moreover, the use of public revenue from tourism receipts in pro-poor public expenditures must be empirically 
verified in each country-specific context. Such a verification falls outside the scope of this study. 

The 13 criteria are divided into two groups. The first group comprises general criteria required to establish an enabling environment 
for tourism development. The second group contains the six criteria that directly address poverty reduction. 

Tourism and Poverty Reduction Strategies in the Integrated Framework

anaLytiCaL FramEwork

Group 1 criteria: Establishing an enabling environment for tourism development

1.  transport infrastructure. High transportation costs affect competitiveness, especially in landlocked countries 
and small island states. Transport costs and quality of infrastructure are of particular concern to the tourism 
sector in LDCs. Lack of quality airport infrastructure, roads, rail, and port services affect tourism arrivals and 
movement within a country. Poor transport infrastructure also impedes the development of the tourism value 
chain, including food and crafts.

2.  Public utilities. Reliable energy and water supply and access to other basic utilities at affordable rates are vital 
for the tourism sector. For sustainability reasons, it is essential that utility usage by the tourism sector does not 
compromise supply availability and affordability for local populations.

3.  information  technology  (it)  and  telecommunication  infrastructure.  IT  and  telecommunications  are 
essential  tools  for  tourism. They  put  tourism  enterprises  in  touch  with  their  customers  (see  country  image 
and marketing strategy below) and provide vital information for planning a visit, from facilities and tours to 
weather conditions. In this age of disintermediation where tourism suppliers are expected to communicate 
directly with potential consumers, good IT facilities (and knowledge of how to use them) are essential. Equally, 
tourists expect reliable internet access and wireless telephony during their travels.

4.  tourism infrastructure and services. The quality and availability of tourism infrastructure and services are 
essential as tourists are increasingly conscious of value for money in selecting distinctive holiday experiences. 
Factors  to  consider  include  the  number  of  beds  available  in  different  categories  of  hotels  and  other 
accommodation, and the availability of tourism attractions, services and products, including sports facilities 
and tours. 

5.  Safety, security and medical services. Safety — both real and perceived — and knowledge of an accepted 
level of risk are essential for successful tourism sectors. Safety and security concerns encompass issues ranging 
from the general security and the political situation in the country, to the risk of natural disasters, the crime rate 
and the general physical inviolability of tourists. Availability of medical services for emergency situations is also 
important. Medical tourism, where the destination offers access to high quality medical or convalescent care, 
has become niche market in several countries.

6.  Hotel accreditation and standards. With increasing competition and requisite awareness amongst tourists, 
meeting international quality standards is a sine qua non. An internationally recognized official classification 
scheme and other standards covering hotels and lodges facilitate the provision of information to customers 
and is a precondition for participating in international networks. Quality and standards also change with time. 
Recently, customer-led satisfaction classifications and the use of social media reviews have started changing 
the way quality and accreditation is perceived.

7.  Country  image  and  marketing  strategy. The  global  media  often  portray  least  developed  and  post-crisis 
countries in negative terms. Many countries are simply not known for the attributes that make a suitable travel 
destination. These  situations  require  appropriate  branding  and  other  well-considered  marketing  strategies. 
E-tourism — which facilitates dissemination of information on the country of destination, services offered and 
online booking — is indispensable.

Group 2 criteria: addressing poverty reduction

8.  Human  resources  development.  LDCs  may  not  have  large  pools  of  human  resources  with  the  required 
skill sets for modern and competitive tourism sectors. Training and skill development for tourism workers is 
crucial  for  enhancing  productivity  and  services.  Human  resources  development  is  intrinsically  linked  with 
vocational training and informed social dialogue. The involvement of social partners (employers and worker 
representatives) is essential when dealing with curriculum development and vocational institutions.

9.  investment  climate  and  small  and  medium  enterprises  (SmEs)  development.  A  favourable  business 
and investment regime is required for a dynamic and competitive tourism sector to attract local and foreign 
investment  and  facilitate  local  and  international  business  linkages.  An  enabling  business  environment  is 
further reflected in the extent to which local people manage or are encouraged to establish SMEs, including in 
the informal sector.

10. Local employment. Tourism is a labour-intensive industry that generates skilled and semi-skilled employment 
opportunities. In addition to the sheer number of jobs, quality of employment issues also require consideration. 
These may include issues of wage levels, working conditions, implementation of standards and basic rights of 
labour conventions, gender equality, appropriate provision for young workers, and empowerment.

11. Business linkages. Strong business linkages maximize the tourism industry’s positive impact on the wider 
economy and population. Through local procurement, the tourism sector can be linked with local producers, 
especially farm, horticulture and fishery producers. Local producers need to ensure a predictable supply and 
meet quality requirements and consumer preferences to be able to compete with imported products. Equally 
important are forward linkages to global networks and an understanding of market needs.

12. Social  and  environmental  sustainability.  Tourism  should  be  sustainable  in  itself  and  in  its  social  and 
environmental impact on net welfare gains. It is essential that appropriate policies, including the promotion 
of environmentally sustainable standards and processes, complement the development of the tourism sector. 
These  standards  include  the  location  of  facilities  and  infrastructure,  as  well  as  the  preservation  of  species 
and their habitats. The active participation of local populations is important for the sustainability of tourism 
development.

13. Preservation of cultural heritage. Tourism can have many positive and negative effects on the culture of the 
destination country. While tourism can help revive traditions which otherwise would be lost and provides the 
opportunity to enhance mutual understanding between different cultures and nations, national heritage sites 
and artefacts also risk damage and loss. Preservation of cultural heritage is, along with natural resources, a 
critical asset for sustainable tourism development. 

Data analysis

The first step in the DTIS data analysis involved extracting details (in the form of actual narrative) from each DTIS and corresponding 
action matrix. These details were then filtered through each of the 13 criteria at the three levels of analysis and noted as ‘occurrences’. 
Table  2  provides  the  example  of The  Gambia  to  illustrate  the  occurrence  of  DTIS  information  related  to  the  business  linkages 
criterion at the three levels of analysis. Detailed country matrices will be made available online. 6

Strengthen linkages between local producers and the tourism industry. Establish a multi-year programme 
of support for the Gambia is Good and Association of Small Scale Enterprises in Tourism schemes 
enabling them to expand their operations and increase linkages with tourism.
Stronger linkages between hotels/restaurants/local tour operators with Gambian producers and 
suppliers. Both support to programmes such as Gambia is Good and the Association of Small Scale 
Enterprises in Tourism programmes and regulation to maintain acceptable standards will be important. 
Promote increased air service and encourage cooperation between tourism and horticulture enterprises.
Encourage import substitution by hotels and restaurants.

Policy and 
regulatory 
framework

institutional 

set-up

Linkages between the accommodation sector and agricultural suppliers are being strengthened thanks 
to the Gambia is Good programme, with one half of all fresh fruits and vegetables supplied locally.
The Association of Small Scale Enterprises in Tourism has a programme to encourage handicraft and batik 
producers to develop new designs and otherwise vary their product offering in order to increase visitor 
spending on incidental purchases.

Supply side/
enterprise

Tourist expenditures outside the hotels are high by international standards, and generate significant 
linkages considering the small size of the local economy.
Nonetheless, for some farmers groundnuts are a marginal activity and better options exist.
Horticulture, sesame and especially cashew nuts represent viable alternatives that should be promoted 
as quickly as possible. These crops would benefit more people than all those engaged in tourism-related 
activities – and significantly more of the poor – even if tourism should double in size. Most of the poor are 
rural, and new opportunities must be found for them.

In the second step, for each of the 30 countries under review, the occurrences were inserted into a matrix to display the adherence 
of the DTIS to the criteria at the three distinct levels of analysis. Shaded cells indicate correspondence of DTIS text with a criterion 
and blank  cells indicate absence of DTIS text with respect to the criterion. This provides a visual representation of DTIS concerns, 
recommendations and other interventions. Again, the summary matrix of The Gambia is presented in Table 3 as an illustration.

In the third step, a composite matrix was created summarizing the 30 individual country matrices. The composite matrix allows 
cross-country analysis and provides a quantitative view of the distribution of references and interventions recommended in the 
DTIS across all 30 countries. The findings of the composite analysis are reported in Chapter 3. 

The  fourth  step  was  to  summarize  the  country  matrices  and  the  comparative  matrix  in  order  to  present  a  picture  of  tourism 
development  in  LDCs,  develop  recommendations  at  the  three  levels  of  intervention,  and  identify  key  messages  on  poverty 
reduction and inclusiveness. 

3.  kEy FindinGS

This Chapter summarizes the main findings of the study, beginning with the results of the intercountry comparisons. This is followed 
by further consideration of the results in relation to the 13 criteria at the three levels of intervention, and in relation to the six core 
criteria that are proxies for poverty reduction concerns.

Country comparisons

Table 4 presents a comparative overview of references in the DTIS to the tourism sector, development strategies and pathways. 
The horizontal axis lists the criteria. The vertical axis lists the countries and three levels of intervention. To allow an overview of the 
tourism development landscape at a glance, the detailed inputs, references and interventions proposed in each country’s DTIS are 
recorded in their respective cells.

This quantitative, but unweighted, table provides a first impression of the analyses and recommendations made in the DTIS. It does 
not capture the qualitative variance across countries; it only summarizes the set of 30 matrices. Table 4 compiles the cross-country 
data in one comprehensive picture to reveal the areas emphasized for tourism development in the DTIS, as well as areas of neglect. 

Table 4 shows cells data as available in actual DTIS. Reference to “empty cells” means no data (reference) pertaining to tourism 
development was found in the DTIS. Access to detailed matrices containing all country occurrences will be made available online. 7

Gaps in the three levels and 13 criteria

From Table 4, it is possible to infer gaps not only in information but also in the actual situation at the three levels — policy, institutions 
and supply side — and the 13 criteria. The analysis allows a number of observations.

First, the tourism sectors in different LDCs are at widely varying stages of development. In some LDCs, the tourism sector is in its 
infancy; in others, it is maturing or passing through an exponential growth phase. The greater the importance of the tourism sector 
in the economy, the more attention the sector receives in the DTIS. Cape Verde, The Gambia, and Solomon Islands rank first in terms 
of the issues covered by their respective DTIS. All three countries recorded 35 shaded cells out of 39, indicating a comprehensive 
chapter dedicated to tourism, covering 90 percent of the criteria. Cambodia, Maldives, and Tanzania, which are well-known tourism 
destinations, also feature strongly.

Overall, the DTIS analysis is qualitatively more sophisticated in countries with relatively mature — given the LDC context — tourism 
sectors status. However, the number of shaded cells in Table 4 alone does not identify the tourism sector’s stage of development. 
This is because the occurrences could both relate to the identification of growth potential and build upon what has already been 
achieved. 

Second, the 13 criteria are broadly reflected in the DTIS. Tourism infrastructure and services collected the most occurrences (88 
occurrences), which is perhaps not surprising given LDCs’ development challenges.

Third, it is rare for a country to not have occurrences in at least one level for each criterion. But there are some exceptions: Sao Tome 
and Principe and Zambia register no occurrences on local employment. Central African Republic and Zambia have none on human 
resources. Both of these exceptions involve criteria that are among the poverty reduction proxies.

Fourth, hotel accreditation and standard-setting (38 occurrences); safety, security and medical services (41 occurrences); and local 
employment (46 occurrences) were the least covered categories. The low occurrence of local employment is particularly surprising 
in view of the pro-poor concern of the DTIS.

BOX 2: DTIS and poverty reduction orientation 

The table below provides a detailed picture of the orientation 
of the DTIS analysis toward poverty reduction. Half the DTIS 
surveyed present a pro-poor indexa over 75 percent and can 
be considered to fully endorse pro-poor concerns.

Solomon  Islands,  Mauritania,  Vanuatu  and  Lao  PDR  show 
the  highest  consideration  of  the  criteria  linked  to  poverty 
reduction,  with  coverage  close  to  90  percent.  Lesotho, 
Zambia, Central African Republic and Sao Tome and Principe 
are at the opposite side of the table, with very few references 
to the core criteria.

a  The  pro-poor  proxy  is  calculated  as  the  percentage  of  cells 
covered  by  occurrences  of  the  six  core  criteria  over  the  total  of 
cells  (234=3x6x13).  The  six  core  criteria  are  human  resources, 
investment climate and SME, local employment, investment climate 
and  SME  development,  social  and  environmental  issues,  and 
preservation of cultural heritage.

Fifth, the six core criteria used as proxies for the poverty reduction orientation of the DTIS account for 45 percent of the occurrences. 
Most of these occurrences can be found under investment climate and SME development (87 occurrences) and human resources 
(69 occurrences). However, the remaining four core poverty criteria are among those with the fewest occurrences. These include 
business linkages (8th, with 65 occurrences); social and environmental sustainability (9th, with 64 occurrences); preservation of 
cultural heritage (10th, with 53 occurrences); and local employment (11th, with only 46 occurrences). See Box 2.

Sixth, references to transport infrastructure and investment climate are found in all DTIS, even if the connection with tourism is not 
always made explicit. Transport infrastructure, public utilities, telecommunication infrastructure and investment climate are usually 
described outside the tourism chapter as they are valid for most of the other sectors examined by the DTIS. In a few cases, issues 
related to air transport are presented in the tourism chapter. The importance of establishing reliable, affordable and frequent air 
transport connections with tourism source markets ranks high in the concerns elaborated by the DTIS. Lack of basic infrastructure 
and poor maintenance is an impediment to any pro-poor tourism growth strategy; without a sustainable volume of tourism, the 
local industry will not be viable.

Overview of intervention levels

Table 5 provides information on references relating to intervention levels across the DTIS. In general, policy references are more 
common than references to institutional arrangements. Recommendations concerning enterprise issues fall between these two 
extremes. The DTIS and their accompanying action matrices are more focused on policy-planning than institutional development, 
although  considerable  attention  is  also  given  to  dealing  with  supply-side/enterprise  issues. This  finding  highlights  the  risk  of 
emphasizing  only  supply  side  and  inward  looking  policies,  while  failing  to  prioritize  interventions  that  make  tourism  products 
competitive and relevant.

The variance between policy and institutional issues is greatest in the DTIS of angola, Guinea, Ethiopia, madagascar, maldives, 
malawi, mauritania, mozambique, nepal, niger, Senegal, Solomon island and uganda. In these DTIS, there are five or more 
criteria in which occurrences at the policy level are not accompanied by references to institutions.

At the other end of the spectrum, institutional references are missing only in hotel accreditation and standards, and social and 
environmental  sustainability  in  Cape  verde’s  DTIS.  the  Gambia  lacks  institutional  references  only  in  human  resources  and 
investment climate. Solomon islands’ DTIS is missing institutional references in three categories. It is generally acknowledged that 
these countries prioritize tourism development. The Solomon Islands’ DTIS is particularly strong in identifying ways and means — at 
all three levels of intervention — to ensure strong linkages between the tourism sector and the other sectors of the economy that 
employ the poor. Solomon Islands scores 94 percent in relation to the six core criteria.

occurrences)

These findings are reflected in Figure 2, which depicts the number of occurrences per level of intervention. The diagram portrays 
the policy bias noted and suggests that some areas related to tourism development lack an integrated formulation of interventions. 
In these areas, actions focus on one or two of the three levels. This approach arguably weakens the effectiveness of the measures 
suggested in the DTIS. 

Overview of the 13 criteria

Table 6 provides a summary of the total number of occurrences of the 13 criteria in relation to the three levels of intervention.

While many of the criteria are covered by the DTIS, the occurrences of five particular criteria are less than the simple average of 66 
occurrences per criteria. These underrepresented criteria are hotel accreditation and standards (38 occurrences); safety, security 
and medical services (41 occurrences); local employment (46 occurrences); preservation of cultural heritage (53 occurrences); and 
social and environmental sustainability (64 occurrences). Three out of these five are related to the six core poverty reduction criteria.

Table 6 indicates that attention to security is negligible. This is surprising since the image of many LDCs — an important variable 
in attracting international tourists — is often negative in source markets. Supply-driven strategies and tourism institutions appear 
to be at risk of misinterpreting consumers and tourism demand. A quick glance at travel advisory services Web sites in the top 10 
tourism-spending nations indicates those countries that tourists are advised to avoid. Box 3 provides information on travel advice 
in major tourism source market as of February 2011.

Figure 3 summarizes the main findings with regard to the 13 criteria and indicates the criteria where most of the occurrences were 
recorded. These are posted on the right side of the diagram. Criteria 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 9 clearly received more attention than the 
other criteria. The relative lack of attention to the local employment and safety, security and medical services criteria is of particular 
concern.

Figure 4 depicts the six core criteria that are used as proxies for poverty reduction. Employment generation in particular receives 
insufficient  attention.  As  previously  noted,  policy  statements  on  pro-poor  strategy  and  provision  are  not  supported  with 
institutional and supply side/enterprise measures. The policy bias and limitations of interventions on one level might compromise 
the  sustainability  and  impact  of  the  actions  implemented.  For  some  criteria  especially — such  as  the  preservation  of  cultural 
heritage and local employment —the lack of institutional references is particularly worrying.

This Chapter provides further observations on the 13 criteria, based on the analysis of recommended action for tourism development 
in the DTIS. These observations relate to enhancing inclusion and the direct benefits to the poor. The discussion begins with the 
general — Group 1 — criteria that address the requirements for building the right enabling environment for tourism development. 
The discussion then moves to the Group 2 criteria that act as proxies for addressing poverty reduction. 

GROUP 1 criteria

transport infrastructure

The connection between the development of the tourism sector and the need to modernize a country’s transport infrastructure 
is reflected in the DTIS. Not surprisingly, all DTIS detect a significant weakness in LDCs’ transport and logistical systems, such as 
widespread inefficiencies, severe underinvestment, uncompetitive monopolies and prohibitive costs. While there are important 
differences in transport infrastructure among the LDCs, they all prioritize investment in transport. 

The discussion of transport in the DTIS is often generic or occurs in the broader context of trade facilitation and logistics. However, 
there are examples where the connection between transport and tourism is explicit. Transport infrastructure is usually reviewed 
according to the mode of transport — roads, railways, maritime and air. A country’s geographic position determines the priority 
placed  on  the  different  modes.  Air  connections  and  port  infrastructure  (servicing  cruise  lines)  feature  strongly.  The  DTIS  also 
value road connections to specific scenic attractions but to a lesser extent in relation to the development of business linkages 
and local procurement of agricultural goods. This bottleneck has clear implications for pro-poor benefits from value chains and is 
not adequately addressed. In The Gambia, for example, the production of food for hotels is limited in part by poor infrastructure. 
Transport systems in and out of the country are often better than those within the country.

The DTIS include the following observations of prevailing transport conditions in some LDCs: 

•  mali. “Expensive travel to and within the country is a great barrier to promote and increase tourism.”

•  yemen. “Poor competitive capacity of the national carrier and its antiquated fleet.”

•  mozambique. “Poor  infrastructure,  expensive  and  low  capacity  transportation;  weakness  in  other  service-

related infrastructure, including air transport.”

•  rwanda. “There are only a limited number of destinations and flights available for passengers and freight to/
from  Kigali  International  Airport.” “The  very  poor  condition  of  unpaved  roads  is  a  major  factor  raising  local 
transport costs. Poor conditions result from heavy rainfalls during the rainy seasons and lack of maintenance.”

•  tanzania. “Of the total road network of 85,000 kilometres, only 27 percent are in good and fair condition, while 

the remaining 73 percent are in poor condition.”

In most of the countries, the recommendations suggest opening the transport sector for investment, establishing public-private 
partnerships (e.g. Ethiopia and Niger) and implementing country transport plans or strategies. Many DTIS call for development 
partners to support these strategies. Examples of specific recommendations include the following:

Tourism and Poverty Reduction Strategies in the Integrated Framework

25

oBSErvationS on touriSm and PovErty

•  uganda. “Improving  the  existing  ferry  service  on  Lake Victoria  between  Mwanza  in Tanzania  and  Port  Bell 
in Uganda, to offer more stops at regionally strategic ports where tourists have quicker and easier access to 
products, for example, Kisumu in Kenya, Musoma, Guta (access to Serengeti National Park).”

•  Cambodia. “The open skies policy encouraged regional airlines to fly directly to Siem Reap and allowed the 

magnificent temples of Angkor Wat to become available to a much broader set of tourists.”

The importance of air connections cannot be stressed enough, as they are often the only way for tourists to reach LDCs destinations. 
The International Air Transport Association 8 has drawn attention to this by supporting inward investment and business productivity. 
Bottlenecks are also found in airport infrastructure and inadequate corollary services. In Sierra Leone the DTIS reports that the 
connection  between  the  country’s  capital,  Freetown,  and  the  international  airport  is  arduous.  By  road,  a  detour  of  about  160 
kilometres  is  necessary,  while  alternatives  are  either  costly  (helicopter),  or  time  consuming  (hovercraft  or  ferry  across  the  river 
estuary).

Due  to  limited  resources  and  management  capacities,  many  LDCs’  national  transport  providers  are  incapable  of  channelling 
sustained tourism flows to their own countries. Consequently contracts are predominately negotiated with Western tour operators 
(including  charter  operators).  DTIS  recommendations  on  the  implementation  of  open  sky  regimes  and  the  liberalization  of  air 
access (e.g. niger) are common, as is the need of proactive government engagement in negotiating entry into the market for new 
airlines and charter operators.

In the Pacific LdCs and the maldives, the DTIS report that maritime transport is “the aorta of the economy.” This includes inter-
island connections within the same country and international cruises. Cape Verde experiences similar challenges, with different 
levels of tourism sector development among the islands. In these cases, better internal transportation services can drive growth by 
expanding tourism development throughout the archipelago and increasing the inclusion of communities in the outlying islands.

Transport infrastructure is an important consideration for poverty reduction and inclusion in tourism development. Along with 
other  infrastructure  programmes  and  investments,  improved  transport  helps  address  the  rural  infrastructure  deficiencies  and 
bottlenecks that hinder local communities from connecting with major national centres.

Public utilities

Reliable  and  affordable  access  to  energy  and  water  is  essential  for  tourism  and  other  economic  sectors.  Effective  and  efficient 
provision of public goods is a key variable in assuring sustainability and minimizing the negative environmental impacts of tourism 
operations.  Most  DTIS  provide  information  on  power  and  water  services,  addressing  efficiency,  quality,  availability  and  tariffs. 
However, only in very few cases are issues such as waste management considered. DTIS notations on public utilities usually include 
references at the policy and enterprise levels, while occurrences related to institutions are comparatively rare.

In the Gambia, “the shortage and high cost of electricity is cited as a major impediment by hotel managers.” The poor state of 
public utilities and the lack of maintenance undermine the viability of tourism development and reduce the return on investments 
due to higher costs.

It is essential to guarantee that access to energy and water for tourism purposes does not jeopardise access by local communities, 
either by restricting the volume of supply (e.g. diverting water from agriculture to hotels) or by increasing prices (hotels and resorts 
are generally in a better position to pay higher unit prices than local communities). Differential pricing can be applied to favour local 
communities over tourism establishments. The improved provision of public utilities can have wide pro-poor impacts by enabling 
local communities to engage in and benefit from the tourism value chain.

it and telecommunication infrastructure

Attention  to  IT  and  telecom  in  the  DTIS  focuses  on  access  and  costs  considerations.  Recommendations  are  usually  generic. 
Institutional considerations are limited and relate primarily to the establishment of regulatory authorities as part of privatization 
programmes  or  private  sector  expansion.  Many  DTIS  include  references  to  broadband  and  quality  of  Internet  connections.  In 
nepal weak and expensive high-bandwidth Internet hinders many export sectors, including tourism. In most cases, IT and telecom 
occurrences in the DTIS highlight the high costs and low quality of telecommunications services, especially outside the capital. In 
Sao tome and Principe, for example, the DTIS reports that telecommunication coverage is low and largely confined to the capital 
city and its surroundings. Several DTIS mention the growth of mobile operators, usually in relation to the increasing number of 
operators and decreasing tariffs.

Improved and affordable IT and telecommunications provision reduce transaction costs and generate efficiencies. Mobile telephony 
in particular has strong impacts on inclusion. The connection with tourism is direct: products and services associated with the 
sector is the second highest selling category of items on the Internet. Tourism enterprises will increasingly rely on IT systems to 
understand market behaviour and commercialize their products.

tourism infrastructure and services

Most  DTIS  provide  information  and  recommendations  on  the  tourism  infrastructure  and  services  criterion. The  DTIS  recognize 
the need to develop and implement national tourism plans and strategies, and to strengthen implementation capacity through 
institutions and partnerships with the private sector. Almost all DTIS estimate the number of tourist arrivals and source countries 
and provide basic information on supply-side issues (e.g. numbers of hotel establishments, size, number of beds, type and nature of 
accommodation services, location, etc). However, the use of these statistics for cross-country analysis is difficult due to comparability 
issues. The application of mechanisms to collect reliable data (e.g. occupancy rates) is recommended in many of the action matrices. 
A few DTIS specifically recommend the adoption of a tourism satellite account.

Tourism  development  plans,  other  than  policy  statements,  should  contain  actions  to  overcome  the  most  prominent  barriers. 
Solomon islands’ DTIS describes the typical set of constraints that tourism policies must address:

•  Access (e.g. flights)

•  Accommodation (e.g. range, quality)

•  Amenities (e.g. access to toilets, cleanliness of environment)

•  Attractions (e.g. the need to preserve and highlight attractions)

•  Activities (e.g. building an array of things for visitors to do)

•  Awareness - community and visitor - (e.g. spending opportunities, cultural norms)

•  Alliances (e.g. lack of cooperation - both formal and informal - within the industry)

Even when present, tourism strategies are not always mainstreamed in the broader country development agenda and poverty 
reduction strategy. In rwanda, for example, the DTIS reports that the government did not consider tourism as a strategic sector in 
its Vision 2020. This is reflected in limited coverage in the country’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. 

In  maldives,  the  Tourism  Act  covers  all  aspects  of  tourism  investment — from  land  allocation  and  leases  to  the  operation  of 
guesthouses, hotels and resorts. A tourism master plan covers other policy issues. From an early stage, the Maldives government 
provided  policy  guidance  and  institutional  support  to  the  sector.  The  recommendations  contained  in  the  DTIS  address  the 
implementation of the third tourism sector master plan by focusing on how to distribute the economic gains, including employment.

Regional and provincial levels of governance may play different roles in the development of tourism. In vanuatu the DTIS notes 
that provincial and even local tourism strategies and plans are in place. With donors or NGO support, the outlying islands are also 
involved in strategy development.

LDCs differ in terms of institutions supporting the tourism sector. Some countries maintain independent tourism ministries. Some 
have established implementation agencies such as associations and boards. It is not possible or useful to assess these differences 
because the context varies.  However, some relevant findings are reported below:

•  Capacity  development  issues  are  a  matter  of  concern  in  most  DTIS. Tourism  support  institutions  are  often 
understaffed  and  marginalized  in  national  budget  allocations.  For  example,  the  Office  of  Tourism  in  mali 
reportedly  has  only  few  professionals.  The  DTIS  suggests  a  review  of  the  personnel  training  scheme  and 
organizational structure.

• 

The mismatch between countries’ vision and strategies and effective implementation arrangements is often 
a major challenge. In mozambique the DTIS proposes to strengthen the government’s capacity to deliver on 
tourism development plans.

•  maldives  seems  to  be  one  of  the  most  well-endowed  countries  in  terms  of  tourism  institutional  support 
infrastructures, which include an independent ministry, a promotion board, and an association of enterprises. 
Responsibility for civil aviation was added the tourism ministry’s portfolio, now the Ministry of Tourism and 
Civil Aviation.

• 

• 

The DTIS frequently mention strengthening public-private partnerships as key to improving tourism promotion 
and overcoming obstacles to the development of the sector.

The  need  to  enhance  the  coordination  of  institutional  actors,  both  private  and  public,  is  another  common 
recommendation. The roles of investment promotion agencies and export promotion bodies in tourism often 
require better coordination. In rwanda the successful implementation of the tourism strategy is specifically 
connected with more effective inter-ministry cooperation mechanisms.

Product diversification and the provision of services other than accommodation is a major challenge for tourism services. However, 
in several LDCs it is possible to find niche operators.  In djibouti, while overall tourism arrivals are relatively low, there are specialized 
operators offering services such as diving and fishing, and products focused on nature and environmental treasures.

The concentration of tourism services in the capital or in a limited number of tourism hot spots is also common in many LDCs. 
Geographic concentrations increase the risk of developing the sector through tourism enclaves with limited linkages to nearby 
communities.

Most  DTIS  do  not  sufficiently  consider  the  question  of  value  for  money  or  competitiveness.  This  oversight  is  due  to  the  fact 
that DTIS recommendations are directed at policy makers not market operators and tourism enterprises. In only a few DTIS are 
recommendations formulated on the basis of a deeper market research effort or demand assessments. 

A few DTIS reference comparator countries (e.g. Vanuatu and Tanzania) and benchmarks. 

It is important to note that many LDCs had modest tourism sectors in the 1960s and 1970s. Political instability and internal conflicts 
hampered growth. In some cases, such as rwanda, Sierra Leone, uganda, tourism infrastructure was destroyed. The DTIS for these 
countries acknowledge the reconstruction challenge. The Diaspora is an important initial target for post-conflict countries and 
development strategies, as is the re-establishment of cultural ties with former colonial powers.

Tourism and Poverty Reduction Strategies in the Integrated Framework

To  a  large  extent,  the  information  on  tourism  infrastructure  and  services  in  LDCs  does  not  analyse  income  generating  and 
employment opportunities for the poor. Uganda’s is the only DTIS to provide estimations of the poverty reduction impact of tourism 
sectoral GDP growth. 

Safety, security and medical services

Safety, security and medical services is the least covered criteria despite its critical importance to the tourism market. Given the post-
conflict environment in many LDCs, this lack of attention is surprising. Where safety and security is mentioned, recommendations 
focus on rebuilding a positive image of the country. In rwanda’s DTIS, security factors are considered a risk to be taken into account. 
In tanzania’s DTIS, safety and security relates to food quality and safety and adequate sanitation, with concrete recommendations 
at all three level of analysis and a special focus on SMEs. uganda’s DTIS is one of the few to include specific references to the 
consequences for the private sector of insecurity. Another set of recommendations includes transportation — mainly air — safety 
and access to hospital and health facilities for tourists. Public health concerns such as HIV and AIDS are also covered. However, in 
general, the DTIS fail to acknowledge the risks and social impact of sexual tourism.

Hotel accreditation and standard setting

The appeal of tourism destinations is increasingly driven by consumer requirements. With the emergence of new destinations, 
the availability of quality services is critical. Specifications about quality and certification are also important in global networks. 
Standards  and  quality  control  issues  are  essential  not  only  in  the  provision  of  tourism  services  but  also  for  local  procurement. 
To  ensure  standards — domestic  or  international — are  met,  awareness-raising  activities  and  targeted  support  by  intermediary 
organizations  and  sector  associations  are  required.  Few  DTIS  mention  quality  considerations  and  accreditation  frameworks  for 
hotels and restaurants. Hotel accreditation and standard setting is the least covered criterion.

In Lao Pdr the DTIS underlines the importance of engaging private sectors associations, noting, “The Association of Travel Agents, 
the Hotel, and Restaurant Association and a potential tour guide association are critical players in coordinating the cluster and 
implementing joint initiatives such as establishing certification committees for hotels, restaurants, and guest houses aligned with 
ASEAN [Association of Southeast Asian Nations] standards.” tanzania has a hotel classification scheme. DTIS recommendations 
touch on concerns over food safety in small- and medium-size hotels where appropriate facilities (e.g. cold stores, preparation 
tables, water treatment systems, proper kitchens) and properly trained staff or management systems to control food safety risks 
may be absent. mali’s DTIS calls for technical support for local institutions in applying ratings to tourism services. mozambique’s 
DTIS contains specific recommendations to improve the inspection mechanism and provide transparent information to consumers.

In most LDCs, issues pertaining to quality and accreditation are a serious constraint on the development of the tourism sector. Poor 
quality does not translate into premium prices and income. Without investment in this domain, including in human capital, LDCs 
would fail to achieve compliance with the existing array of international standards. Of course, the promotion of hotel accreditation 
and standard setting does not in itself increase the quality of the tourism services provided. Other criteria, such as the investment 
climate and SME development, are also important for improving quality standards in the tourism sector.

Quality has different meanings in different markets and quality assurance systems are changing as consumers increasingly trust 
social media over government hotel ratings. LDCs must adjust to the inevitable decline in relevance that official standards will hold 
for consumers.

Country image and marketing strategy

Most of the attractions in LDCs — excluding world heritage sites such Angkor Wat in Cambodia and natural parks in Africa — are not 
sufficiently known. Even when LDC destinations are well known, most LDCs struggle with a negative image. Political instability and 
conflict seriously hinder tourism potential, and image reversal initiatives can be costly.

Tourism and Poverty Reduction Strategies in the Integrated Framework

29

oBSErvationS on touriSm and PovErty

The limited resources available for marketing strategies and promotion activities call for well-designed marketing interventions. 
The initial growth in tourism experienced by Lao PDR and Cambodia was linked to extensions of Thailand’s tourism packages. 
Accordingly, some DTIS advocate a regional approach that connects with better known brands. Mozambique’s DTIS illustrates this 
approach by connecting with South Africa’s more high profile tourism industry. This is a viable option for LDCs in Southern and 
Eastern Africa, which could benefit from joint initiatives with South Africa or Kenya. The Regional Tourism Organization for Southern 
Africa was established in 1996 and provides an institutional framework for regional cooperation among SADC members. Most DTIS, 
however, do not provide sufficient information on the effectiveness of regional cooperation mechanisms. 

angola’s DTIS makes specific suggestions to improve the country’s image. These include establishing information and marketing 
procedures to advertise Angola and build a positive image; raising the visibility and improving the perception of Angola as a tourist 
destination; and increasing tourism marketing, starting with business travellers already travelling to Angola. 

Lao Pdr’s DTIS makes evident the technological gaps in the marketing of tour operators. Of the 60 tour operators in Lao PDR, only 
10 have operating Web sites.

maldives  is  clearly  the  most  advanced  LDC  in  marketing. The  Maldives Tourism  Promotion  Board  operates  overseas  offices  in 
Germany and the United Kingdom. 

Limited information on country supply capacity and trends in world demand make it difficult to design marketing strategies, as 
many DTIS illustrate. To be effective, promotion strategies must be based on solid data and market intelligence. DTIS must also be 
innovative in showing how marketing can be linked to campaigns to eradicate poverty and draw tourists’ attention to the role the 
industry can play in poverty reduction. 

GROUP 2 criteria

Human resources

The human resources criterion is important for human development and poverty reduction since it relates to the quality of jobs, 
skills and empowerment. Most DTIS include a section on human resources, referencing policy initiatives and the establishment 
of institutions that provide training beyond what is offered by hotels and resorts. The common challenge for LDCs is to upgrade 
skills  to  provide  sophisticated  and  high  value-added  tourism  services.  The  involvement  of  partners — employers  and  worker 
representatives — is essential when developing curricula and vocational institutions.

Even in LDCs where the tourism sector has grown significantly, the DTIS note the need to improve education and skills of workers. 
These concerns are reflected in the DTIS of Cape verde, which cites vocational training improvement as a priority action. DTIS 
recommendations include pilot programmes to establish or upgrade hotel schools with greater private sector participation. Private 
sector involvement is essential for relevance and quality of training. 

In maldives the Maldives College of Higher Education’s Faculty of Hospitality and Tourism Studies provides tourism training. The 
curriculum covers bartending, catering and food services, and cleaning and housekeeping. The programme has not been able to 
keep pace with industry demand. The DTIS recommends the decentralization of existing training facilities to allow more activities 
at atoll level and to benefit women. In the Pacific there is scope for collaboration in promoting a regional tourism training centre, as 
mentioned in vanuatu’s DTIS.

Skill development facilitates employment opportunities. Learning opportunities must be open to the poor and groups such as 
women and ethnic minorities who often face discrimination. Additionally, skill development interventions do not need to focus 
only  on  direct  employment  in  the  hospitality  industry.  One  of  the  most  promising  areas  for  poverty  reduction  is  through  the 
strengthening of the supply chain that serves the tourism sector. The production of quality food, for example, coupled with on-time 

30

Tourism and Poverty Reduction Strategies in the Integrated Framework

oBSErvationS on touriSm and PovErty

delivery can multiply the economic benefit of tourism without relying on increased tourist arrivals. Developing and upgrading the 
skills in the supply chain require coordination between different vocational training institutions and supporting programmes.

investment climate and SmE development

Most DTIS dedicate a chapter to the investment and business climate. The picture that emerges with respect to the investment 
climate for tourism indicates common challenges in attracting long-term investments outside the primary sector. Land ownership 
issues  and  the  role  of  land  as  investment  collateral  is  often  referenced  as  a  legal  obstacle. This  is  especially  a  concern  where 
tourism is the leading sector, such as in Cape verde, maldives and vanuatu. It is important to provide incentives for business 
models where profits derive from tourism facilities, rather than models where profits are mainly generated from land sales or 
construction.

While the DTIS do not provide consistent data on the share of investment in tourism, the sector often attracts a substantial share 
of FDI. In tourism-dependent countries such as maldives, up to 80 percent of FDI was reportedly directed to the tourism sector. 
Enclave resorts are not the only development option for LDCs; the demand for tourism products is now more diversified. Comoros’s 
DTIS reports initiatives related to the refurbishment of state-owned hotels through partnerships with foreign investors from the 
Gulf. Few LDCs, such as vanuatu, maintain economic activities reserved exclusively for nationals.

In terms of institutional setting, many LDCs have investment promotion agencies. However, limited human and financial resources 
often  challenge  the  work  of  these  fledgling  institutions.  Several  LDC  governments  engage  in  some  degree  of  SME  assistance, 
including microfinance provision, usually with the support of development partners. However, the linkages between SMEs and FDI 
and other large-scale investment, and opportunities for the poor, are often not made.  

Local employment

The DTIS rarely refer to local employment and almost no occurrences are found at the institution level. The DTIS also pay limited 
attention to gender participation in the tourism sector and quality of jobs and enforcement of labour conventions. All of these 
issues are fundamental to pro-poor tourism. 

Only a few DTIS make references to gender participation. In maldives a gender bias in tourism employment patterns is mentioned 
in relation to enrolment of women for training in hospitality and tourism. vanuatu’s DTIS calls for increasing female participation 
in the tourism sector.

Some DTIS mention employment in relation to backward linkages (e.g. transport and agriculture). The share of indirect employment 
generated by tourism can be high, as in the case of djibouti, where it reaches 50 percent. Description of the labour force is often 
connected  to  the  lack  of  skilled  human  resources. The  issue  of  expatriate  workers  features  in  the  Pacific  LDCs  and  other  small 
islands where competition for jobs is strong. The maldives’s DTIS notes that “with foreign workers accounting for over half the 
total number of jobs in the tourism sector, the recommendations deal with labor market issues, education and training.” These two 
countries enacted legal provisions to limit the employment of foreign workers. 

There is a clear mismatch between policy provisions and institutional arrangement in support of local employment. Cape verde, 
where the DTIS recommends the establishment of a recruitment centre, is an exception. Cape Verde’s DTIS also recommends the 
provision of information about tourism job opportunities at secondary school level.

Overall, DTIS coverage of the employment contribution of the tourism sector is inadequate. Most policy recommendations envisage 
the potential that tourism development holds for job creation. For example mauritania‘s DTIS proposes a review of licenses and 
taxes to promote employment in the tourism sector. The prominence of the informal economy, which characterizes many LDCs, is 
only marginally addressed in relation to tourism.

Tourism and Poverty Reduction Strategies in the Integrated Framework

Business linkages

The supply of goods and services to tourism enterprises by the poor or by enterprises employing the poor is one of the channels 
through which tourism contributes to poverty reduction efforts. Linkages between sectors are necessary to promote growth and 
broad-based  development  in  LDCs,  where  internal  markets  are  often  small  and  industry  clusters  are  not  competitive  in  world 
markets. The tourism sector can have strong linkages with the agriculture, fishery, construction and manufacturing sectors, among 
others. Modern resorts require high-quality products. While in the past there was overreliance on imports, recent developments in 
corporate social responsibility have persuaded hotel chains to invest in local sourcing. Other linkages occur in the creative industry, 
including cultural products and artisanal activities. Encouraging poverty alleviation through sustainable supply chain management 
is arguably one of the greatest areas of potential for achieving poverty reduction. Leakage of benefits should be guarded against. In 
Cambodia leakage is reportedly high due to lack of adequate linkages to agri-food sector.

Several DTIS value the importance of establishing business linkages between tourism and other sectors of the economy. vanuatu, 
for example, is considering establishing intermediary organizations to on-sell products to the tourism sector. maldives’ DTIS closely 
examines how to link the fisheries sector with the tourism sector to support employment and income generation. 

The “Gambia is Good” programme is an example of linkages between tourism enterprises and agricultural suppliers. Under this 
programme, which is cited by other countries’ DTIS as a positive example, local farmers supply half of all fresh fruits and vegetables 
required by the country’s tourism sector. The Association of Small Scale Enterprises in Tourism in The Gambia sponsors a programme 
that encourages handicraft and batik producers to develop new designs and otherwise vary their product offering to increase 
visitor spending. Guinea’s DTIS also underscores the potential in connecting tourism activities with handicrafts production.

A number of DTIS, such as those of Lesotho, yemen, and Zambia, are silent on business linkages. 

Lack of finance and poor entrepreneurial skills limit some agricultural producers’ abilities to move up the value chain and establish 
linkages with the tourism sector. The DTIS of Comoros suggests the establishment of a public partnership to sustain small-scale 
poverty  reduction  projects  financed  by  the  biggest  tourism  resorts. The  projects  would  target  sectors  along  the  tourism  value 
chain, including agriculture production and souvenirs and artifacts. The objective is to provide training for future entrepreneurs 
accompanied by microcredit lines.

The Cape verde DTIS clarifies another important linkage. Tourism development has fueled a local construction boom. While a 
tourism-related construction boom may spur short-term employment creation, it can foster a growth pattern that is unsustainable 
in the long term. 

mali’s DTIS underscores the importance of the linkage with the cultural industry by referring to the music industry’s positive impact 
on Mali’s image as a tourism destination. This link does not appear in Senegal’s DTIS, although Senegal is also well known for its 
cultural industries.

Lack  of  coordination  between  institutions  is  an  obstacle  to  enhancing  intra-sectoral  linkages.  Specific  recommendations  to 
strengthen  institutional  support  for  reinforcing  business  linkages  are  made  in  mauritania’s  DTIS.  Institutional  weakness  in 
supporting economic diversification is noted in Benin.

The  participation  of  local  communities  and  local  entrepreneurs  in  tourism  development  is  an  important  driver  for  promoting 
linkages with the local economy, as widely recognized in some of the DTIS.

Social and environmental sustainability

The social and environmental sustainability criterion is particularly relevant to human development and draws attention to the 
degree  to  which  sustainability  considerations  influence  tourism  discussions.  Sustainability  considerations  cover  the  tourism 
development product cycle, from the physical development of tourism-related structures through appropriate location and design.

There are several dimensions to social and environmental sustainability. First, tourism has undeniable social and environmental 
impacts. Hotels consume large amounts of water and energy and produce large amounts of waste. They affect local societies by 
consuming already scarce resources. Second, tourism can help preserve the natural and societal assets that it relies on, such as 
biodiversity and flagship species and their natural habitats, as well as local people. Third, tourism contributes directly to climate 
change and carbon emission, mainly through travel. Most DTIS focus on the second dimension and overlook the others. The lack of 
reference to climate change, despite its well-known threat to islands and other vulnerable LDCs, is surprising.

Many DTIS recognize that tourism has positive and negative impacts on social and environmental considerations and acknowledge 
that win-win solutions must be identified. Information, analysis and recommendations on environmental considerations are not 
lacking. Information is provided on preservation initiatives for the management and protection of parks as well as potential areas 
of conflict. 

Some DTIS highlight risks related to specific tourism niches such as hunting. niger has developed an unusual tourism product: 
hunting.  Hunting  operations  in  Niger  involve  large  tracts  of  land  leased  to  foreign  nationals.  In  the  Agadez  region  alone,  four 
concessions  have  been  allotted  on  an  experimental  basis  and  seven  more  are  under  consideration.  The  DTIS  recalls  that  the 
implications  of  hunting  concessions  on  nomadic  pastoralism  were  not  carefully  reviewed,  and  recommends  a  thorough  cost-
benefit analysis before more concessions are granted. The DTIS also offers an interesting example of cooperation. The plateau of 
Kouré is the habitat for the last surviving giraffes in West Africa. Nigerian, Dutch, and European Union cooperation has helped revive 
the populations from a low of 50 animals to about 140. Communities in the region were trained to live with and protect the animals.  
Kouré is a tourist attraction in itself and an example of community participation to protect a threatened species.

Given  the  natural  endowments  of  many  LDCs,  the  development  of  ecotourism  is  often  flagged  in  DTIS  sections  dedicated  to 
tourism. Some of these environmental resources are shared between different countries: ‘Parc du W 93’ is a trans-frontier wildlife 
sanctuary shared by Benin, Burkina Faso and niger. Zambia has developed an inventory of potential tourism development sites, 
with its 19 national parks and 34 game areas covering 33 percent of the country. However, while the DTIS addresses the use of 
environment assets for tourism development, the discussion of the sustainability and suitability of opening national havens to 
tourism development is marginal.

The  DTIS  also  review  the  institutional  aspects  of  sustainability.  There  appears  to  be  limited  communication  between  the 
organizations responsible for environmental preservation and those responsible for tourism development. uganda’s DTIS reports 
the  establishment  of  a  wildlife  authority  that  is  responsible  for  managing  Uganda’s  10  national  parks  and  14  wildlife  reserves. 
However, the authority has not built strong ties to the private sector and has been reluctant to introduce innovation in park and 
reserve management. 

Some DTIS reveal interesting findings on how the social and environmental dimensions of tourism development can lead to poverty 
reduction outcomes. The Ugandan DTIS cites the Kakum Canopy Walkway in Ghana as an example of how to sustainably exploit 
the richness of a protected area by providing additional income to the local population. By charging admission fees, local people 
developed an alternative source of income to replace environment-damaging income generating activities. In addition, tourism 
generated by the walkway brought new jobs and revenues that could be used to preserve the endangered rainforest ecosystem. 
Uganda’s DTIS suggests a similar pathway may be available given Uganda’s diversity of primary forests.

The DTIS in mozambique recommends that tourism development planners work with local entrepreneurs and communities in 
specific areas, such as ecotourism and eco-lodge development and management, wildlife interpretation, community-managed 
conservation areas, and marine life conservation. However, few details are provided on how to implement such initiatives.

Preservation of cultural heritage 9

The conservation of cultural heritage sites and the preservation of local cultures and lifestyles are important dimensions of human 
development. Cultural tourism is both a niche market and a central feature of most travel to LDCs. Tourism can have positive as well 
as negative impacts on the culture of the destination country. These impacts are difficult to assess and value and the DTIS tend to 
overlook this aspect of tourism. Preservation of cultural heritage is one of the criteria with relatively few occurrences in the country 
matrices. Even when references are found, they are generic or superficial. Worryingly, most mentions of cultural heritage describe 
the exploitation of cultural resources for tourism purposes, with limited reference to promoting responsible forms of tourism that 
will preserve cultural heritage. While only a few LDCs — such as Cambodia — have assets such as renowned historical sites, the 
cultural dimension of the travel and the business linkage between the cultural industry and tourism should be better addressed in 
the DTIS.

yemen’s DTIS reports an “abundance of unique scenic and historical attractions which make tourism a sector with considerable 
unrealized  potential.”  However,  it  also  refers  to  the  challenge  of  assigning  funds  to  historical  preservation  and  the  need  to 
involve development partners to preserve cultural heritage. The General Organization for the Protection of Cultural Heritage in 
Yemen and the General Organization for Antiquities are insufficiently supported by the national budget. vanuatu’s DTIS notes 
a “growing desire on the part of visitors to experience something unique and different—both mass tourists and niche groups.” 
The corresponding recommendation is limited to a proposal for a more active engagement of institutions in promoting cultural 
experiences. nepal’s DTIS makes the innovative proposal to develop health tourism by attracting patients to Ayurvedic medicines 
and related culture.

In mauritania preservation of cultural heritage and traditions has not taken root, despite the government’s commitment and the 
support of donor partners. There are important synergies arising from promoting both tourism and cultural industries as referenced 
in  the  case  of  mali,  where  the  link  is  considered  significant.  In  Senegal,  the  tourism  sector  is  reported  to  have  failed  to  take 
advantage of the rich cultural offerings (e.g. Jazz festival in St. Louis). Cultural tourism is also emphasized in the DTIS for Asian LDCs 
such as Cambodia and Lao Pdr.

The DTIS’ focus on natural resources is understandable given the strong assets at the disposal of LDCs. However, a more balanced 
and inclusive approach toward the development of cultural attractions should be considered in several countries.

5.  ConCLuSionS and rECommEndationS

The road to a vibrant tourism sector is not without challenges. Converting comparative advantage into competitiveness requires 
a  coherent  policy  framework,  effective  and  efficient  institutions  and  a  proactive  private  sector.  In  addition,  a  national  tourism 
development  strategy  must  inevitably  address  issues  that  extend  beyond  the  sector  and  establish  cross-sectoral  linkages. This 
wider perspective is required if tourism development is to positively affect inclusion and poverty reduction. 

Thirty of the 35 DTIS reviewed prioritize the tourism sector. This is an important message for the development community, especially 
in view of the low priority traditionally assigned to the tourism sector in development cooperation.

9  UNESCO international agreements — the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage (1972) and the 
Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage (2003) — provide a legal framework for the preservation of heritage assets for 
cultural and eco-tourism development.

DTIS should fully incorporate sustainable and inclusive tourism 10 considerations in the sector 
analyses

The main message to emerge from the DTIS review is that much more must be done to incorporate pro-poor concerns, gender issues 
and sustainability considerations. Occurrences of the six criteria that were used as proxies for poverty reduction and inclusion reveal 
serious gaps in about half the DTIS examined. To overcome these shortcomings, the following observations and recommendations 
should be considered:

• 

• 

• 

The DTIS should provide detailed analysis of the impact of tourism development on poverty reduction and the 
opportunities for inclusion, particularly for communities located close to tourism establishments.

The absence of institutional backstopping in relation to the six core criteria or proxies indicates that a major 
effort is required to incorporate and internalize pro-poor objectives within public agencies and programmes.

The DTIS analysis tends to focus on the supply side and on the resources required to strengthen a country’s 
offer, rather than on demand side and market considerations. There is limited acknowledgement of the need 
to develop market-relevant tourism products. This could lead to the formulation of unsustainable policies and 
low or negative returns on public expenditures devoted to tourism development.

•  More information on gender participation in the tourism sector is needed to identify concrete actions to reduce 

participation gaps. The DTIS that were examined were particularly disappointing on this issue.

• 

The DTIS have not adequately shown how to better connect vocational training and skill upgrading efforts with 
local employment opportunities.

•  While  the  DTIS  underscore  the  importance  of  social  and  environmental  sustainability,  they  do  not  provide 
adequate  perspectives  on  how  to  ensure  the  participation  of  communities  in  the  development  and 
management of tourism development interventions. 

• 

The  DTIS  make  limited  reference  to  segmenting  and  targeting  markets  in  relation  to  responsible  use  of 
economic, social and environmental assets and limitations. The result is that all forms of tourism are encouraged 
in the apparent belief that they will implicitly contribute to poverty reduction. This leaves limited space for 
tourism strategies that are specifically designed to disproportionately benefit the poor.

•  Appropriate  forms  of  tourism  development  and  preservation  of  environmental  and  cultural  assets  should 
proceed  hand-in-hand.  LDCs’  most  valuable  assets  are  their  immense  natural  resources. The  DTIS  have  not 
shown how these assets should be preserved for future generations. There are only a few references to efforts 
aimed at limiting the consumption of natural resources by tourism facilities, and limited mentions of preserving 
wildlife  and  habitats.  More  importantly,  climate  change  issues  and  innovations  in  green  technologies  and 
architecture do not feature in DTIS discussions.

The stated goal of the DTIS is to ascertain the main constraints and obstacles that impede LDCs’ integration into the world economy 
so that they may benefit from trade and globalization. To this extent, the intention of the DTIS is not to produce a national tourism 
strategy, a capacity assessment of tourism institutions, or a comprehensive sectoral analysis. The aim rather is to identify priority 
actions for governments, stakeholders and partners to undertake in scaling up the supply response.

10  ITC defines inclusive tourism as “A means of tourism development that fosters links and interaction between the different actors in the tourism 
industry, forms partnerships with private actors, stimulates the local economy and promotes the integration of poor men and women and active 
involvement of local communities. It emphasizes sustainability, taking environmental, social and economic factors into account.”

ConCLuSionS and rECommEndationS

It should also be acknowledged that the DTIS differ on the length and depth of their tourism sectoral analysis. The DTIS of Maldives 
and Cape Verde, for example, strategically place tourism in each section of the diagnostic and do not relegate it to the sectoral 
chapter.

The DTIS represent a significant and unique source of information on LDCs because they merge strong macroeconomic and sectoral 
analysis with stakeholder consultations and participatory validation processes. Despite these strong advantages, most of the DTIS 
surveyed are not entirely successful in outlining strongly inclusive scaled-up tourism supply responses.

Most  DTIS  make  only  generalized  observations  about  large-scale  reforms.  In  addition,  the  analyses  are  not  systematically 
disaggregated.  No  DTIS  employs  an  analytical  framework  that  is  similar  to  the  one  adopted  in  this  study — the  three  levels  of 
intervention, 13 criteria and pro-poor proxies. 

Specific issues to be addressed in future DTIS 

A number of specific shortcomings should be addressed in future DTIS and DTIS updates:

•  Overall, the DTIS give insufficient attention to the nexus between infrastructure, tourism development and 
poverty reduction. Some DTIS (e.g. Maldives) do make this connection and they can guide future DTIS work. 
Two of the greatest challenges for LDCs are lack of adequate infrastructure and weak institutions.

• 

• 

• 

• 

Security  and  political  stability  are  key  factors  in  building  a  positive  country  image  and  attracting  foreign 
and domestic investment for tourism development. In post-conflict countries the perception of risk may be 
disproportionate to actual conditions. These issues must be sufficiently addressed. Security is a prerequisite for 
tourism.

The DTIS do not adequately consider quality and (national or international) standards. A systematic approach 
toward building a client-oriented culture, which is supported by industry and labour standards and monitoring 
and compliance systems, is lacking. 

The tourism sector requires a wide spectrum of skills and also provides opportunities for the unskilled. The 
need for training and skill development through domestic providers and in partnership with global chains or 
regional vocational centres is critical and requires more emphasis.

The tourism sector is sensitive to various external shocks, as illustrated by its response to the 2007–2008 global 
recession. Contingency considerations for dealing with shocks do not feature strongly in the DTIS. Different 
tourism products and source markets might mean different levels of resilience to external shocks. Future DTIS 
should reflect this reality.

•  While many LDCs are competitors in the tourism market, cooperation is also possible. The regional facet of 
tourism  is  clear  in  Mozambique’s  DTIS  and  others  in  Southern  Africa,  where  SADC  countries  established  a 
regional organization to promote tourism. Regional cooperation would benefit from further attention in future 
DTIS.

Conclusion

Governments  should  be  aware  of  the  impacts  of  different  forms  of  tourism  development  and  promote  growth  models  with 
assumptions  and  implications  that  are  fully  understood.  A  pro-poor  tourism  approach  will  seek  forms  of  development  that 
disproportionately  benefit  the  poor.  Inclusive  tourism  development  entails  targeted  support  programmes,  investment  in 
infrastructure and increased community participation. The functioning of domestic markets should be improved to reduce leakage

and capture benefits for the national economy. Integration within global tourism networks and practical action to establish linkages 
with other sectors of the economy and along tourism value chains are also key elements of pro-poor tourism development.

tourism sections in the next generation of dtiS

Under the EIF, a number of countries will prepare DTIS updates and new entrants will undergo diagnostic exercises. It is hoped 
that the insights from this study will provide some indications of how tourism sectoral assessments and recommendations can be 
improved.

A sustainable tourism development strategy or sectoral policy should consider the cross-sectoral dimension of tourism and the 
need to integrate tourism development in the broader development agenda while building the country’s competitive advantage. 
Differentiated approaches and contextualized solutions are needed. Any strategy for tourism development should be dynamic 
enough to adapt to changing circumstances and priorities in order to maximize poverty reduction impacts.

In preparing the next round of DTIS, it will be important to highlight pro-poor measures that have a positive impact on human 
development. Analysis and recommendations should not only focus on increasing overall competitiveness and productivity but 
also on promoting sustainability and inclusion. Intuitively, tourism development is expected to fight poverty, but the link is neither 
automatic nor straightforward. Gender, income generation, employment, and opportunities aimed at youth should be taken fully 
into account. To quote the outcome document of the LDC IV pre-conference event  in Caen, “Analysing the different drivers of tourism 
development and studying the performance of actors at each stage is helpful for policy makers, institutions and entrepreneurs to 
pinpoint the competitive disadvantages and identify points for further action to achieve pro-poor growth.” 11 Clearly, there is much 
room for improvement in future DTIS.
