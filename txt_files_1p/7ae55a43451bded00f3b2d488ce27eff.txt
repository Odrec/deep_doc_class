Recap/addendum to last week

• An argument is a series of sentences that includes a set of 

premises and a conclusion.
– The set of premises may be empty!

• An argument is valid iff it is impossible for the conclusion to be 

false when the premises are all true.

• An argument is sound iff it is valid and all of its premises are true.

• Can an argument with no premises be valid and/or sound?
• Yes, if the conclusion is a tautology, i.e. necessarily true.

– These arguments are valid, because it is impossible for the conclusion to 

be false no matter what!

– They are also sound, because none of the premises are false (and 

therefore, all of them are true!)
