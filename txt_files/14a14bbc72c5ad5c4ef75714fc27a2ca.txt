Abstract
One of the most exciting developments in the ﬁeld of bacterial pathogenesis
in recent years is the discovery that many pathogens utilize complex nanoma-
chines to deliver bacterially encoded effector proteins into target eukaryotic
cells. These effector proteins modulate a variety of cellular functions for the
pathogen’s beneﬁt. One of these protein-delivery machines is the type III
secretion system (T3SS). T3SSs are widespread in nature and are encoded
not only by bacteria pathogenic to vertebrates or plants but also by bacteria
that are symbiotic to plants or insects. A central component of T3SSs is
the needle complex, a supramolecular structure that mediates the passage of
the secreted proteins across the bacterial envelope. Working in conjunction
with several cytoplasmic components, the needle complex engages speciﬁc
substrates in sequential order, moves them across the bacterial envelope, and
ultimately delivers them into eukaryotic cells. The central role of T3SSs in
pathogenesis makes them great targets for novel antimicrobial strategies.

INTRODUCTION
Many bacteria have evolved specialized machines to deliver effector proteins into target eukaryotic
cells with the capacity to modulate a variety of cellular activities (7, 59, 94). Type III protein
secretion systems (T3SSs) are arguably the best characterized of these protein injection machines
(20, 32, 62). In the pregenomic era, these systems were most often identiﬁed in the context of
searches for genes involved in intimate host-pathogen interactions (60, 68, 112). However, in the
postgenomic era, it is now clear that T3SSs are widespread in nature, playing important roles not
only in pathogenic but also in symbiotic interactions in the context of vertebrate, plant, or insect
hosts (21, 34, 129). Although the secretion machine is highly conserved across bacterial species, the
effector proteins that it delivers are speciﬁc for each pathogen or symbiont that encodes them (59).
In this article, we describe the main components of these fascinating nanomachines and discuss
what is known about their function. We do not attempt to comprehensively review the literature.
Rather, we describe what in our view are the most important aspects of the structure and function
of these machines. This article focuses on T3SSs involved in protein delivery into eukaryotic cells,
which we view as substantially different in many important aspects from related systems involved
in motility (53). In addition, we do not cover the diverse activities mediated by the effector proteins
delivered by these machines. Finally, we recognize that the nomenclature of the genes involved
in T3SS in different bacteria can be confusing and can hamper comparisons between different
systems. Therefore to facilitate the reading of this article we provide a table (Table 1) listing
the nomenclature of homologs in the most-studied systems as well as a previously introduced
unifying nomenclature (70). When necessary, we provide gene or protein names, with emphasis
on homologs from T3SSs of Salmonella, Shigella, and Yersinia spp., which are arguably the most
studied.

EVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS OF THE T3SS
Recent phylogenetic analyses support the notion that T3SSs are an evolutionary exaptation of
the ﬂagellar apparatus (114) and that this process may have proceeded in two steps (1). The ﬁrst
step, the products of which can still be detected in Myxococcales spp. (80), led to a structure that
is competent for protein secretion although it is no longer able to carry out motility functions.
The second step, which may have occurred more than once, involved the recruitment of secretins,
