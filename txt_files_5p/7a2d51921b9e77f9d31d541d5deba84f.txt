negation and downward monotonicity

Metalinguistic negation

Conclusion

Logical negation

All of us know when and how to use negative expressions, but what
is the unconscious linguistic knowledge that we have about them?

FOL: ¬, ¬¬p = p

(cid:74)not(cid:75) (cid:32) λp.¬p, i.e. sentence negation denotes a function

from a proposition to a proposition and thus has the semantic
type of < t, t >.

negation and downward monotonicity

Metalinguistic negation

Conclusion

From logic to natural language

Sentence negation is not the only natural language expression
that has a negative force.

quantiﬁers: no, at most n, few
adverbs: not, never, seldom, rarely, scarcely
prepositions: without

Two negatives don’t always make a positive: negative concord

I won’t give you nothing.
Je n’ai pas mang´e.

The English word not and its counterparts in other languages
have meanings and uses beyond the logical negation.

Conclusion

negation and scale

In the last lecture, we talked about linguistic scales as consisting of
a set of linguistic alternatives that are ordered by degree of
informativeness.

1 Jack ate all of the cookies. ⇒
2 Jack ate many of the cookies. ⇒
3 Jack ate some of the cookies. ⇒

What will happen if we pair each alternative of a given scale with a
negation? Consider:

1 Jack didn’t eat all of the cookies. ⇐
2 Jack didn’t eat many of the cookies. ⇐
3 Jack didn’t eat some of the cookies. ⇐

Conclusion: negation is downward entailing / downward monotonic
/ monotonically decreasing!

Conclusion

Deﬁning downward monotonicity

Deﬁnition
A function f is monotone decreasing (DE) iﬀ
((x ⊆ y ) ∧ f (y )) ⇒ f (x).

In-class exercise: show that without is a DE function.

trout ⊆ ﬁsh, and thus
John cooked a Christmas dinner with trout. ⇒
John cooked a Christmas dinner with ﬁsh.
John cooked a Christmas dinner without ﬁsh. ⇒
John cooked a Christmas dinner without trout.

Conclusion

Quantiﬁers and monotonicity 1

We’ve talked about natural language quantiﬁers before. Now, we
will address one of the interesting logical properties between
quantiﬁers that distinguish them from one another. Consider:

(1)

(2)

(3)

a. All men walked rapidly. ⇒ All men walked.
b. All men walked rapidly. (cid:54)⇐ All men walked.
a.
b.
a. No man walked rapidly. (cid:54)⇒ No man walked.
b. No man walked rapidly. ⇐ No man walked.

Some man walked rapidly. ⇒ Some man walked.
Some man walked rapidly. (cid:54)⇐ Some man walked.

All men or some man is an upward monotone (mon ↑) NP; no man
is a downward monotone (mon ↓) NP.

Now, consider the following inference patters:

Some Chinese man walked. ⇒ Some man walked.
Some Chinese man walked. (cid:54)⇐ Some man walked.

a.
b.
a. All Chinese men walked. (cid:54)⇒ All men walked.
b. All Chinese men walked. ⇐ All men walked.
a. No Chinese man walked. (cid:54)⇒ No man walked.
b. No Chinese man walked. ⇐ No man walked.

All or no is ↓ mon; some is ↑ mon.

Conclusion

Quantiﬁers and monotonicity 3

Q(A, B), A is the restrictor (i.e. left argument) of Q and B the
scope (i.e. right argument) of Q.

(7)

Deﬁnitions:
a.

left upward monotone (↑ mon):
(Q(A, B) ∧ A ⊆ A(cid:48)) ⇒ Q(A(cid:48), B)
left downward monotone (↓ mon):
(Q(A, B) ∧ A(cid:48) ⊆ A) ⇒ Q(A(cid:48), B)
right upward monotone (mon ↑):
(Q(A, B) ∧ B ⊆ B(cid:48)) ⇒ Q(A, B(cid:48))
right downward monotone (mon ↓):
(Q(A, B) ∧ B(cid:48) ⊆ B(cid:48)) ⇒ Q(A, B(cid:48))

Conclusion

Introducing metalinguistic negation

Consider:

It’s not a car, it’s a Volkswagen. (VW commercial
advertisement)

It’s obvious that negation is not used logically, as a Volkswagen is
a car. It is also clear what the ad is intended to convey, namely, it
(a Volkswagen) is not e.g. an average car. This marked and
nondescriptive use of negation is called metalinguistic negation -
“a device for objecting to a previous utterance on any grounds
whatever, including the conventional or conversational implicata it
potentially induces, its morphology, its style or register, or its
phonetic realization” (Horn 2001:363).

More examples of metalinguistic negation

Stressed not, nicht

Chris didn’t manage to solve the problem - it was quite easy
for him.
We didn’t make love - we fucked.
He’s not meeting a woman this evening - he’s meeting his wife.

Conclusion

Metalinguistic negation and kinds of meaning

In the previous lectures, we’ve talked about the cancellability of
kinds of meaning, i.e. CPs and CIs are not cancellable whereas
conversational implicatures are cancellable.

Metalinguistic negation can be used to cancel CPs.
1 You don’t know that it is raining. It is not raining.
2 The King of France is not bald - (because) there is no king of

France.

Metalinguistic negation can be used to cancel a conversational
implicature.

I am not happy. I am ecstatic.
It’s not warm out. It is hot.

How about metalinguistic negation and conventional
implicatures?

1 Er hat nicht behauptet, dass er krank sei. Er ist krank.
2 Ames, the former spy, is not behind bars.

Conclusion

Conclusion

Metalinguistic negation is not the only kind that diﬀers from
logical negation. There is a kind of negation which is often
assumed to be semantically vacuous and thus called
pleonastic/expletive negation. (examples from Yoon 2013)
