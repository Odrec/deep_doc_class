MAJOR CIVIL SERVICE REFORMS (1987-1993)

oThe Civil Service Reform Programme ( CSRP), 1987 was a component 

of the Structural Adjustment Programme
Key Objectives;
- Improvement of human resource management 
- Reduce overstaffing 
- Help achieve macro economic stability
- Help reduce government expenditure

oThe National Institutional Renewal Programme (NIRP), 1994 was a 

capacity building programme under good governance

- The Civil Service Performance Improvement Programme (CSPIP) 

under the above programme was launched in 1995 to replaced CSRP

Key Objectives;
- Address the shortcoming of the CSRP

- Produce a working document on ‘ Towards a New Public Service for 

Ghana’

oDecoupling of the Civil Service, 2011
- Creation of a new Service to be solely incharge of Ghana’s new 
decentralization agenda ( Local Government Service ie Act 656, 2003)

Ghana.

RESEARCH QUESTIONS

mandates of the reform programmes carried 
out?

Have these reforms programme yielded 
efficiency in the Civil Service?

THEORITICAL FRAMEWORK

The Weberian bureaucratic model/theory will 
undergird the research.
