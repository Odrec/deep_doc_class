Globalizing Quiescence: Globalization,
Union Density and Strikes in 15 Industrialized
Countries

James A. Piazza
University of North Carolina at Charlotte

This study examines the role played by globalization in the decline of
strike rates in industrialized countries after the 1980s. Using a
pooled, time-series multiple regression analysis of 15 advanced
capitalist countries in North America, Western Europe and East Asia
from 1952 to 2001, the author ﬁnds a relationship between
globalization – measured in terms of international trade, investment
and loosened international capital controls – and declining strike
rates, but ﬁnds that the relationship is non-monotonic and that the
level and change of union density plays an intermediary role between
globalization and labor quiescence. The ﬁndings empirically validate
earlier work by Tsebelis and Lange and Shalev, who also
demonstrated a non-monotonic relationship between macroeconomic
phenomena, labor strength and strikes.

Introduction

Historians of industrial relations in the 1970s, in observing a marked
increase in industrial militancy in advanced capitalist countries,
speculated that the increasing frequency and intensity of industrial
conﬂict was either a cyclical ‘uptick’ spurred by stagﬂation that
would revert back to the ‘regular’ level of strikes seen in the 1950s
and 1960s or that the political and social turmoil of the decade
had permanently changed industrial relations, and that the turbulent
1970s were a harbinger of things to come1 (Brecher, 1972). Neither
was to be the case. The militant 1970s were followed by the quiescent
1980s and 1990s. Strike rates, measured as the number of working

days lost due to industrial conﬂicts per worker, fell in every indus-
trialized country and remained lower than not only the level of the
1970s but also of the 1960s and 1950s in most countries until the
beginning of the 21st century. This ominous quiescence seemed to
defy the tempo of the business cycle or short-term macroeconomic
disruptions. Table 1 illustrates this strange decline of strike activity.
Looking at the average strike rates in the bottom row of Table 1,
it is clear that strike rate levels remained fairly constant throughout
the 1950s and 1960s and after increasing during the militant 1970s,
they began to decline in the 1980s, dipping below the ‘mode’ set
between 1950 and 1969. This decline continued even more precipi-
tously during the 1990s, setting a new level of quiescence, 59.6 per-
cent lower than the previous decade and roughly 61 percent lower
than the strike rates of the 1950s and 1960s. Looking at individual
countries, the picture becomes more complex and a few patterns
emerge. The largest group of countries, Australia, Austria, Belgium,
Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Switzerland
and the UK, seem to roughly adhere to the pattern established by

the average for the entire set of 15 countries tallied in the bottom row
in that strike rates after 1980 were signiﬁcantly (at least 30 percent)
lower than those prior to 1980. However, a smaller group, Denmark,
Finland, Sweden and Norway, either had strike rates in the 1980s
and 1990s that were higher (up to ﬁve times higher in the case of
Sweden) or not signiﬁcantly lower than those witnessed prior to
1980.

The Puzzle

What explains the beginning of labor quiescence in 1980, a phenom-
enon noticed by Perusek and Worcester (1995) and Shalev (1992),
and its intensiﬁcation after the 1980s for the average and largest
groups of countries listed in Table 1? Furthermore, what explains
the diversity of the group of countries? Why have most countries
experienced a resurgence of quiescence while a minority have seen
increasing militancy?

Much of the classical literature on strikes is not particularly
helpful in answering these questions because it locates the cause of
industrial conﬂict in the ﬂuctuations of the business cycle or the
schedule of contract (re)negotiations or changes in the political
climate (Budd, 1994; Cameron, 1984; Korpi and Shalev, 1979;
Hibbs, 1978; Rees, 1952; Kalecki, 1943). Certainly, business booms,
recessions and recoveries do affect strikes and it is intuitive that
strikes are more likely in years in which large contract negotiations
occur, which may be on a regular basis for countries with peak-level
bargaining. Also, changes in political leadership, for example the
assumption of power by the Thatcher administration in Britain in
1979, clearly will have implications for industrial action, either nega-
tively or positively. However, most of these phenomena have a
short-term impact on labor relations and one would not expect
any of these to produce such long-term (20-year!) effects.

The literature on comparative labor market institutions provides
important pieces of the puzzle. First, scholarly work on centralized
bargaining and the effects of international trade on small advanced
capitalist states demonstrates that exposure of unionized workers to
pressures from the international market promotes general wage
restraint and labor peace in order to maintain national competitive-
ness in export markets (Garrett and Way, 1995; Iversen, 1996;
Katzenstein, 1985; Lange et al., 1995; McKeown, 1999; Swenson,

1991, 1989; Wood, 1994). Second, it has also been convincingly
demonstrated that the organizational capacity of workers is an
important determinant of collective activities such as strikes and
industrial action (Shorter and Tilly, 1974; Tilly, 1978; Snyder,
1975). Shalev (1992) speciﬁcally identiﬁes union density – the
number of unionized workers as a percentage of the total work-
force – as a crucial indicator of workers’ organizational capacity,
and as a key determinant of strike activity. Finally, a large body
of studies indicates that common macroeconomic features have
different effects on unions, labor markets and domestic labor activ-
ity depending on the structure of institutional features such as wage
bargaining, union density and the status of social-democratic parties
(Freeman, 1989; Lange and Scruggs, 1999; Pedersen, 1982; Piazza,
2002; Rothstein, 1989; Visser and Ebbinghaus, 1999; Western, 1997).
Two studies in particular, however, provide a useful framework
for explaining the general labor quiescence of the 1980s and 1990s
and the renewed labor militancy in four other cases. First, Shalev
(1992) observed that patterns of strike activity among industrialized
countries vary both by time-period and by country. In his study,
he broke his observations of strikes in advanced industrialized coun-
tries into three time-periods. In the ﬁrst period – 1960–7, a period
characterized by rapid economic growth and low unemployment –
strikes fall into four groups of cases: countries such as Switzerland,
Norway, Sweden, Germany and the Netherlands, which exhibit
strikes involving few workers for a short duration; countries such
as France, Italy and Australia, which have brief strikes but with a
mass participation of workers; countries such as the US, Canada
and Ireland, which have strikes that are few in number but are
long and protracted; and countries such as Japan, Britain, Belgium,
New Zealand, Finland, Austria and Denmark, which exhibit strikes
of a medium duration and participation rate. The second period,
1968–73, is turbulent and shows some convergence among countries
in terms of rates of worker participation in strikes, but with little
alternation of the previous patterns of duration. The post-1974
period, a period of stagﬂation and rising unemployment, witnesses
strikes dramatically declining in France, Japan and the US, while
dramatically increasing in terms of participation in Sweden and
Norway.

Shalev concludes with the observation that the three countries
that lead the pack in terms of declining strike activity post-1974,
the US, France and Japan, are also the three countries in which

union density decreased the most after 1973. Moreover, of the six
countries that experienced a decline in union density, four also
exhibited a precipitous decline in the relative involvement of workers
in strikes. The two countries that experienced a sharp increase in
strike activity, measured in terms of worker participation in strikes,
were Sweden and Norway, two of the most heavily unionized coun-
tries in the industrialized world. Though it is not the central focus of
his study, union density and degree of worker organization is an
important component of his observations about deviations in strike
patterns. Shalev explains, ‘Workers’ ability to prosecute industrial
action is dependent not only on the favourability of market forces
but also on their capacity for collective action, particularly the
prior extent of labour organization. . . . It might well be the case,
therefore, that longer-term shifts in the extent of worker orga-
nization have an appreciable effect on strike-proneness’ (Shalev,
1992: 117).

The second study provides more insight into the puzzle of national
divergence of strike activity displayed in Table 1. Noting that con-
ventional explanations would predict that strikes in industrialized
countries should converge toward a mean, Tsebelis and Lange
(1995) take a ﬁrst cut at trying to combine macroeconomic, political
climate and organizational models of how strikes occur in indus-
trialized countries. In doing so, they make an important contri-
bution by considering a non-monotonic relationship between the
strength of labor (which they deﬁne more broadly than organized
labor) and the incidence of strikes. They observe that while OECD
countries experienced quite similar macroeconomic challenges in
the 1970s and 1980s, among them the challenge of increasing open-
ness to the international economy, unemployment and inﬂation,
levels of strike activity sharply diverged as did the degree of corpor-
atism and the political power of the left.

To explain this phenomenon, Tsebelis and Lange consider two
alternating-offers game theory models. The ﬁrst sets labor against
capital in a negotiation over the division of proﬁts wherein labor
may at any stage of the alternating offers choose to pursue an ‘out-
side option’ by going on strike. The second presents the same sort of
game but with incomplete information. Capital does not know the
value of labor’s outside option, the ability to go on strike, and so
therefore is engaged in bargaining with an adversary that can be
either ‘strong’ or ‘weak’. In both games, the authors note, a discount
factor makes both players eager to come to resolution.

Economic and Industrial Democracy 26(2)

The outcome of the game predicts a curvilinear model of labor
strength and the incidence of strikes. In cases where labor is
strong, capital has an immediate incentive to compromise with
labor and will conclude negotiations with an eye to avoiding a
costly strike. In cases where labor is weak, it is instead labor that
has incentives to compromise in order to come to agreement because
a strike is too costly for it. In both of these situations, Tsebelis
and Lange predict a generally low incidence of strike activity. It is
when strong labor becomes weaker and when weak labor becomes
stronger that the problem of incomplete information rears its head
and strikes are more likely. Employers are likely to become more
intransigent when bargaining with labor that was once strong but
has become weaker. Though it is losing power, labor may not yet
feel compelled to acquiesce; indeed it may feel it unwise to do so
during the alternation of offers lest it encourage capital to drive a
harder bargain. Conversely, labor that is getting stronger from an
earlier position of weakness will hold a stronger line against capital
in order to brandish its newly vitalized outside option, while capital
may wish to hold onto its previously dominant bargaining position.
In either situation, when labor power is growing or shrinking, strikes
are more likely. The authors empirically test their predictions by
regressing change in strikes with change in labor strength, producing
statistically signiﬁcant results.

Enter Globalization

What explains the timing of the general decline of strike rates in
Table 1? The 1980s, when the quiescence (or the militancy for four
of the countries) begins, and the 1990s, where it rapidly accelerates,
are also the decades that are commonly identiﬁed with the beginning
and the acceleration of globalization of national economies (Visser,
1994). Economic globalization is deﬁned as the increasing inter-
connectedness of domestic economies with one another, and is
often measured in terms of rising international imports and exports
and an acute increase in international investment stocks. Table 2
illustrates the change in these indicators of globalization during
the last ﬁve decades, averaged for the 15 countries listed in Table 1.
Theoretically, there are two ways that globalization might be a
contributing factor to the strike phenomena illustrated in Table 1.

in the public

First, globalization intensiﬁes pressure on ﬁrms, both domestic and
multinational, by increasing inter-ﬁrm competition as national mar-
kets become more integrated. New entrants to the global market
intensify the existing competition among multinational corpora-
tions. Domestic ﬁrms, previously sheltered from international com-
petition, are increasingly exposed to foreign competitors and foreign
products. All ﬁrms ﬁnd that global competition is squeezing their
proﬁt margins and that they must reduce costs in order to maintain
market share. Interestingly, the ‘proﬁt squeeze’ scenario can also
apply to governments and workers
sector.
Globalization increases pressure on governments to attract or
retain globally mobile capital investment, an important source of
jobs for citizens and public revenues, by tinkering with taxes, interest
rates and regulatory policies. The adoption by states of ‘globally
capital friendly’ policy, in turn, places wage pressures on domestic
public sector employees as government policy-makers hasten to
implement ﬁscal austerity plans. These changes have implications
for domestic workers across all sectors should government policy-
makers choose to also reform wage-setting and workplace institu-
tions that bolster unionization or high wages in an attempt to pro-
vide business-friendly environments for globally footloose capital.2
Second, globalization provides opportunities for proﬁt-squeezed,
or proﬁt-maximizing, employers to outsource production abroad
where wages and operating costs might be lower. Proﬁt-squeezes
lead employers to demand wage and other labor cost concessions
from workers at the bargaining table. Outsourcing leads to a

296

Economic and Industrial Democracy 26(2)

direct reduction in union and/or high-wage employment in the out-
sourcing company. Both of these processes lead to an erosion of
labor power. The pressures of globalization are related to the reduc-
tion in union density rates in many countries – in addition to
facilitating the outsourcing of union jobs to non-union plants
abroad – by altering the bargaining position of unions vis-a-vis
employers in a way that reduces the utility of union membership,
namely job security and premium wages, to existing and prospective
union members. When unions can no longer guarantee high wages
and secure employment, workers come to see union membership
as a waste of dues, at best, and a liability at worst.

The erosion of union density compromises the ability of workers
to engage in collective activities, such as strikes. Again, considering
the aforementioned scholarship that demonstrates that common
macroeconomic processes have different national effects, because
domestic institutions mediate these processes (see especially Waller-
stein and Western, 2000; Western, 1997), we could expect globaliza-
tion and the erosion of union density to have divergent effects on
actual strike rates across cases. In the Nordic countries, where
strong unions and centralized bargaining ordinarily foster low
strike rates, globalization may increase strike activity if it erodes
strike-reducing labor market institutions, such as union density
and peak-level bargaining. In countries characterized by low levels
of unionization and decentralized bargaining, France or Japan for
example, globalization could reduce strike activity if it compromised
the vehicles workers usually use to launch and coordinate strikes:
labor union. Though he does not mention the globalization of
national economies among the macroeconomic factors affecting
the observed changes in strikes, and the concomitant changes in
union density, the question hangs above Shalev’s (1992) analysis
due to the timing of the changes. The post-1974 period is one of
rapidly increasing globalization of trade and investment and a relax-
ing of international capital controls, as indicated in Table 2. And the
countries that see the most dramatic change in strike activity are
those at the top and the bottom of the scale in terms of union
density. The notoriously low density countries, France, Japan and
the US, which also experienced decreasing unionization rates
throughout
the 1960–74 timeframe, had the most precipitous
declines in strikes while the very high density countries, Norway
and Sweden, which had stable and increasing density rates respec-
tively, had an increase in strikes.

Analysis

Therefore, the objective of this study is to determine whether globa-
lization is a signiﬁcant predictor of strike activity in industrialized
countries and whether or not labor market institutions, in particular
union density, determine how globalization affects strike rates.
Of particular interest is how globalization affects strikes in cases
characterized by high and low union density and how it affects
strikes in cases where union density is increasing or decreasing
from a high or low base. Three hypotheses are tested using a
pooled time-series multiple regression analysis on a data set
composed of 15 advanced, industrialized democracies: Australia,
Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany,
Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK.3
These hypotheses are:

Hypothesis 1: If we at ﬁrst ignore the role played by domestic insti-
tutional features, such as union density, we would expect globali-
zation to be negatively related to strike
rates, because
globalization improves the relative bargaining position of capital
to labor by allowing employers the opportunity to exit abroad or
to demand concessions by claiming a ‘proﬁt squeeze’ from
increased international competition during negotiations with
unions. In this scenario, unions, cognizant of their severely com-
promised bargaining position, are wary of strikes and opt to
concede at the bargaining table in order to preserve domestic
employment.

Hypothesis 2: However, understanding that country-speciﬁc institu-
tional features, such as union density, do play a role in determin-
ing how macroeconomic processes affect bargaining and other
labor market phenomena, we would expect to ﬁnd the negative
effects of globalization on strikes to be particularly acute in coun-
tries where labor movements are weaker and where labor markets
are not highly ‘institutionalized’. Countries with strong labor
movements would either not display a signiﬁcant relationship
between globalization and strike rates or would display a positive
relationship as globalization erodes the institutions that constrain
worker militancy.

Hypothesis 3: Because Tsebelis and Lange (1995) demonstrate that
not only does the level of labor strength matter in determining
the behavior of employers and workers, and by extension whether

298

or not a strike will occur, but also the direction of change of labor
strength over time is crucial, we would expect to see a positive
relationship between strike rates and globalization in countries
where union density is decreasing from an already high level or
increasing from a moderate to low level. We would expect to see
no relationship or a negative relationship between globalization
and strike rates in countries where union density is increasing
from a high base or decreasing from a moderate to low base.

The analysis involves observations in all 15 cases for the years
1952–2001, yielding a total number of 669 observations for which
complete data are available. The Appendix details the sources and
calculation procedures for all data. The core analysis consists of
seven regression models, one aggregate and six sorted, and involves
the following variables:

Strikerate (strike rate) is the dependent variable of the analysis
and is calculated as the annual total number of days, per capita,
lost to strikes and lockouts nationwide in a given year from 1952
to 2001 in the 15 countries examined.4

Globalization, the primary independent variable, is operationa-
lized as an index (Globalization) composed of three indicators of
economic globalization: a measurement of a country’s international
exports and imports as a percentage of gross domestic product; a
measurement of the total yearly direct5 and portfolio investment
abroad as a percentage of gross domestic product; and Dennis
Quinn and Carla Inclan’s 1997 index of ﬁnancial capital control
openness (see Appendix). Given the hypothesized importance of
the effects of globalization on union bargaining strength vis-a-vis
employers, particularly given that employer proﬁt-squeezes due to
increased competition with imports and opportunities for employers
to outsource abroad to lower costs often work in tandem, it is useful
to consider an indexed measure of globalization that includes trade
as well as capital investment. To assess the role played by country-
speciﬁc labor market institutions or other features that may affect
labor’s power, I examine union density levels (Density), the degree
of union centralization (Central) and the degree of left party domi-
nance (LeftPart) over parliamentary governing seats and govern-
ment portfolios in the 15 countries between 1952 and 2001.

The ﬁrst institutional predictor, union density, is the measurement
of the percentage of the national workforce that is unionized as

eid.sagepub.com

Piazza: Globalizing Quiescence

299

coded in Golden et al.’s (2002) data set on union centralization as
‘totden’. The second institutional predictor, the degree of union
centralization, is a measurement also derived from the Golden et
al. data set – coded by the investigators as ‘coninv’ – that rates the
level of involvement of union confederations in wage setting using
an index between 1 and 11. The third institutional predictor, the
degree of left party (LeftPart) dominance over national governments
and legislatures, is a measurement of the ‘center of gravity’ in terms
of right–left dominance of national governments calculated as the
difference between the percentage of cabinet portfolios, governing
seats and legislative seats held by ‘left’ and ‘right’ parties in the
15 countries using Swank’s 1999 data set on partisanship, supple-
mented by recent electoral data (see Appendix).

Expectations about union density and globalization as predictors
are covered in the hypotheses. Centralization of wage bargaining is
assumed to be a negative predictor of strike rates mainly because
peak-level bargaining agents exert signiﬁcant disciplinary power
over local actors and most peak wage pacts have strong labor
peace clauses attached to them6 (Calmfors and Drifﬁll, 1988).
Whether or not the degree of left party power is a signiﬁcant predic-
tor of strike rates, and whether it is a positive or negative predictor,
should largely rest on the overall political conﬁguration of distribu-
tional conﬂicts in a country, and may pattern somewhat the effects
of union density on strike rates as indicated previously. Countries
with hegemonic left, labor-allied parties that have worked with
unions to construct pacted, corporatist bargaining structures, for
example, again, the Nordic countries, will likely display a negative
relationship between left party power and strike rates (Western,
1997). In these countries, strong left parties have successfully
relocated distributional conﬂicts from the workplace to the political
system and have thereby been able to foster industrial peace.
Countries where the political left is not hegemonic, or where it is
junior to center or right parties, may either have no signiﬁcant
relationship or a positive relationship with strike rates. In the case
of the latter, the assumption of power by a left party might either
signal to workers that the time is opportune to strike before the
political climate changes or may provide workers the political space
to conduct strikes.

The remaining variables are all

active workforce employed in manufacturing, measures the rate of
deindustrialization in the countries examined. This variable is con-
sidered to test the thesis put forth by Piven (1992) that the decline
of industrial employment, or ‘deproletarianization’, is the cause
for the decline of the postwar hegemony of social democracy, the
core of which is the provision of ‘social peace’ and a moderation
of industrial conﬂict in exchange for collective bargaining rights
for workers and state-provided social welfare. However,
the
relationship between deindustrialization and strike rates is likely
to be ambiguous. While a declining manufacturing workforce may
result in low unionization rates (Visser, 1991; Troy, 1990; Bell,
1973), as mentioned previously this could reduce strike rates in
countries with already low union density or it could increase strike
rates in countries where high union density fosters labor peace.
Also, deindustrialization is related to sectoral employment changes,
and this could wash out any effects on strike rates if the concentra-
tion of jobs in an economy moves from the private manufacturing
sector to, for example, the public sector, which may itself be even
more strike-prone.

Previous empirical studies seeking to explain the diversity of strike
activity among industrialized countries undertaken by Cameron
(1984), Korpi and Shalev (1979, 1980) and Hibbs (1978) consider
several contributory factors related to welfare states, wages and
labor market policy. The overall results yielded by these studies is
that in countries that exhibit substantial public investment in
social resources, strike activity will be shorter and less frequent.
I therefore consider welfare state and wage factors in my analysis
by using two dependent control variables: StateGDP and Real-
Wages. The ﬁrst of these measures the percentage of gross domestic
product comprised by government social spending per year to deter-
mine the effects of government social spending on strike rates. The
second measures the annual percentage increase in mean real
wages to determine whether rising (or stagnating) real wages are
related to decreased (or increased) strike activity. Given that rising
real wages and state intervention in the economy are factors likely
to protect workers’ real material resources, both are likely to
foster labor quiescence and to be negative predictors of strike rates.
My analysis includes three additional macroeconomic control
variables: Unemployment, or the national unemployment rate;
GDPGrowth, or the annual growth rate for gross domestic product;
and Inﬂation, or the annual inﬂation rate. All three of these variables

are linked by scholars to strike activity and all three have been
demonstrated by other scholars to be positive predictors of strike
activity (Ingram et al., 1993; Kalecki, 1943; Rees, 1952).7

Results

The results of the seven regression models are displayed in Tables 3
through 5. Model 1 is displayed in Table 3, and it provides evidence
supporting the ﬁrst hypothesis, that globalization is negatively
related to strike rates in the aggregate. In Model 1, the independent
variable Globalization is a signiﬁcant negative predictor of strike
rates and indeed has the largest coefﬁcient out of any of the variables
in the model, signiﬁcant or not. Union centralization is also a signi-
ﬁcant negative predictor of strike rates, as expected given the litera-
ture on centralization and wage restraint (Calmfors and Drifﬁll,

1988). All of the macroeconomic independent variables, except
GDPGrowth, are also signiﬁcant predictors of strike rates in the
expected manner. In the aggregate, IndEmpl is a signiﬁcant negative
predictor, thus not eliminating the hypothesis that deindustrializa-
tion erodes the collective action power of workers posited by
Visser (1991), Troy (1990) and Bell (1973). The degree of left party
dominance (LeftPart), however, is not signiﬁcant.

In Model 1 union density itself is not signiﬁcant. This result sug-
gests that the mechanism by which globalization is linked to labor
quiescence, put forth in the ﬁrst hypothesis, is dependent on institu-
tional conﬁgurations that are not addressed in the aggregate model.
The possibility that the relationship between globalization, union
density and strike rates is non-monotonic, rather than linear, in
the manner presented by Tsebelis and Lange (1995) and Shalev
(1992) is still intact and is addressed in Models 2 though 7 through
the process of splitting the ﬁle to expose how the level of union
density and change in union density might mediate the way in
which globalization affects strikes.

It should also be noted that a large number, seven out of 11, inde-
pendent variables in the model are signiﬁcant, and that some of
them, mainly the macroeconomic variables, could theoretically be
predictors of each other. This raises the question of multicollinearity
in the model. However, collinearity tests on the model produce
tolerance levels above .10 and VIF statistics below 10, above and
below the acceptable thresholds. Collinearity statistics are likewise
run on the remainder of the models (numbers 2 through 7) and
they produce the same results, indicating that multicollinearity is
not present.

Table 4 presents the results of Models 2 and 3, which divide the
data set into ‘high union density’ and ‘low union density’ sets.
These sets are created by sorting the cases into those with union
density rates that exceed and those that are below the median
(39.1) for the entire data set. In some instances, the 50 observations
that comprise an entire country (one observation per year, 1952–
2001) were sorted into one set, while in others, country observations
were sorted into different sets. The total number of observations is
roughly equal between the sets: 321 for high density and 347 for
low density. The results do reveal that globalization bears a different
relationship to the observations depending on the set: it is a signiﬁ-
cant, negative predictor with a rather large coefﬁcient in the low
density set while it is not signiﬁcant though positive in the high

density set. In the high density set, furthermore, union centralization
is a negative predictor of strike rates while it is not signiﬁcant in the
low density set. The macroeconomic control variables also have
different relationships to strike rates in the two sets, with the excep-
tions of growth of real wages and inﬂation, which are consistent
across the two sets: negative in the case of real wage growth and
positive for inﬂation. While both IndEmpl and StateGDP are signi-
ﬁcant negative predictors in the low density set, they are neither
signiﬁcant nor do they have negative coefﬁcients in the high density
set. While unemployment is a signiﬁcant positive predictor in the
high density set, it is not signiﬁcant in the low density set.

of Models 2 and 3 and try to capture the non-monadic structure pre-
dicted by Tsebelis and Lange (1995).

case, based on the average level of union density as compared to the

median and the direction of change, increasing or decreasing, of
union density experienced by the country. For the latter distinction,
the sorting is completed by subtracting the average union density
level for the years 1980–2001 from the average union density level
for the years 1952–1979 for each country. The purpose of this is to
capture the change of union density levels before and after the
onset of globalization. For the purposes of my analysis, I use
Visser’s (1994) estimate of 1980 as the starting point of globalization,
as 1980 marks the year by which most industrialized countries com-
pletely liberalized their national capital accounts and foreign invest-
ment policies.8 Also, by 1980 the full impact of the collapse of the
Bretton-Woods ﬁxed exchange rate system was felt by most indus-
trialized countries and the rate of both international trade and
investment began to rapidly increase. The results of the sort are
presented in Figure 1.

Models 4 through 7 empirically test

the hypothetical non-
monotonic relationship between ‘labor strength’ and strike activity
employed by Tsebelis and Lange (1995) and Shalev (1992), and
the results seem to partially validate their hypotheses. In countries
where union density is high and increases from the pre- to the
post-globalization period, globalization is not a signiﬁcant predictor

of strike rate. Instead, only IndEmpl is, and it is a positive predictor.
In countries where union density is high but decreases in the post-
globalization era, globalization is a signiﬁcant but positive predictor
of strike rates, with an extremely large coefﬁcient. IndEmpl is a
positive predictor of strike rates as is inﬂation. For countries quali-
ﬁed by low density rates, but where union density increases from the
pre- to the post-globalization time-period, globalization is a signi-
ﬁcant negative predictor of strike rates, as is IndEmpl. However,
growth of real wages is a signiﬁcant positive predictor. Finally, in
countries with low average union density rates that decrease from
the pre- to the post-globalization period, globalization is also a
signiﬁcant negative predictor. Union centralization is as well,
along with a host of macroeconomic control variables: IndEmpl,
growth of real wages, unemployment, growth of GDP. Inﬂation is
also signiﬁcant for this group, but it is positive.

Conclusion

Models 4 through 7 present the most comprehensive picture of how
globalization affects strikes in the 15 countries in the analysis and
with Models 1 through 3, some signiﬁcant conclusions can be
yielded.

First, in the aggregate, globalization (measured in terms of inter-
national trade, investment and liberalization of ﬁnancial controls) is
negatively related to union militancy, but is joined by a large number
of other macroeconomic variables also related to strikes. But it
is generally accepted that macroeconomic factors affect unions
and workers differently in different countries due to domestic-level
labor market
institutions, and the aggregate model does not
adequately capture this.

Second, where labor is ‘strong’, using union density as the primary
measurement of union strength, globalization is not a signiﬁcant
factor in determining strikes. However, where union density is
low, globalization is a signiﬁcant contributor to labor quiescence.
These ﬁndings are consistent with Shalev’s (1992). Other macro-
economic variables that might affect strike activity are signiﬁcant
in both high and low density countries, while one institutional vari-
able, degree of union centralization, reduces labor militancy in coun-
tries with high levels of union density.

307

Finally, considering both the strength of labor and change in
labor strength, strikes are almost wholly unaffected by macro-
economic forces in countries where unions are strong and have
grown despite globalization. Where union density is on average
high but has decreased during globalization, globalization is a
highly signiﬁcant contributor to union militancy, as are two other
macroeconomic variables, growth of industrial employment and
inﬂation to a much lesser extent. This ﬁnding is most consistent
with the result found by Tsebelis and Lange (1995): that strikes
increase in countries in which labor is ordinarily a strong player,
but is becoming less powerful.

However, the results deviate from Tsebelis and Lange’s ﬁndings in
the case of countries where unions are not as strong, but have experi-
enced growth in the post-1980 period. For these countries, globaliza-
tion is a (quite strong) force promoting quiescence rather than
militancy. But the curvilinear relationship described by Tsebelis and
Lange is borne out again when looking at countries where union
density is low and has become lower in the post-globalization era.
In these countries, globalization is also related to labor quiescence.
But also noteworthy is the sheer number of other macroeconomic
variables that also are negatively related to strikes. The latter ﬁnding
supports previous ﬁndings by Wallerstein and Western (2000) and
Western (1997), among others, demonstrating that the degree to
which macroeconomic forces affect unions and workers is deter-
mined by domestic labor market institutions such as the structure
of wage bargaining, union density levels, the position of social-
democratic parties and the provision and management of public
selective beneﬁts such as unemployment insurance.

These results underscore the argument that institutional conﬁgura-
tions of labor markets matter. They play a role in determining
how broad macroeconomic forces affect domestic actors in the
wage bargaining process, of which strikes are an important compo-
nent. The results also facilitate the argument that change – of insti-
tutional features and the position of actors in political economies
such as labor unions – is also critical. Without consideration of
both static institutional conﬁgurations and dynamic actors within
those conﬁgurations, much of the non-linear effects of economic
processes on economies can be missed.

Notes

The author would like to thank several people for their help on this article. The ﬁrst is
Ms Lyda Fontes, who served as the research assistant and helped in data collection.
The author is also indebted to Marcus Crepaz and Andy Martin, both of whom
served as discussants on panels where the study was presented as a paper and provided
useful feedback, as well as Michael Shalev who provided valuable feedback and advice
on a later iteration of the article.

1. Brecher concludes his exhaustive historical study of industrial protest in the US
with a quote by former United Auto Workers’ president Walter Reuther, ‘There is a
new breed of workers in the plant who is less willing to accept corporate decisions that
pre-empt his own decisions’ (Brecher, 1972: 264). Brecher goes on to quote several
other sources that indicate that the ‘new’ generation of workers in American industry
are far more willing than previous generations to use strikes to voice disagreement
with management, to facilitate wage and other workplace demands and to communi-
cate political messages to society at large. Brecher extensively documents the intensi-
ﬁcation of industrial conﬂict – both through authorized and illegal strike activity –
against employers in all sectors of the economy; and also to an extent against the
union establishment itself.

2. Though Taylor Dark’s (1999) innovative work The Unions and the Democrats:
An Enduring Alliance points out that during the 1993 NAFTA debate in the US oppo-
sition to the trade agreement was divided between workers in exposed and private
sectors and workers in non-tradable public and service sectors. Dark is correct to
stress that sectoral distinctions are important in determining the reactions of orga-
nized labor to globalization, however several examples indicate that traditionally
unexposed sectors are likewise susceptible to the pressures of globalization. For
example, during the 1995–6 General Strike in France, the public transportation
workers’ union led the popular opposition against ﬁscal austerity measures instituted
by the Chirac government. In the conﬂict, international economic forces were a key
component alongside austerity. The striking union and its allies argued that a host
of regional and global pressures, from France’s plan to join the European Monetary
Union to increased relocation of French industry abroad in search of cheaper labor
costs, had prompted the budget cuts to social services and public sector wages and
came to regard globalization as an integral component of the threat to the French
welfare and wage system.

3. See Shalev (1978: footnote 1).
4. For a full discussion of the various measurements of strike activity used by
scholars who study industrial conﬂict, consult Korpi and Shalev (1980). The measure-
ment used in this study, referred to by Shalev (1992) as ‘relative volume’, is best suited
for aggregate analysis of strikes because it combines the most important measure-
ments of strike activity: frequency, size and duration.

5. For the purposes of this study, I employ a deﬁnition of direct investment abroad
that corresponds with that of the US Department of Commerce: the ownership or
control by a country’s resident of at least 10 percent of the voting securities of an
incorporated foreign business enterprise; see Malatoni (1997).

6. Though Wallerstein and Western (2000) note that under centralized bargaining
systems, repudiation of peak agreements by locals or groups of workers is a possible
outcome.

7. However, in their empirical study of the incidence of strikes in British manu-
facturing, Ingram et al. (1993) uncovered a counter-cyclical relationship between
unemployment and unions’ willingness to strike. As unemployment worsened, so
did strike activity in contrast to theoretical expectations and some empirical studies
of strike activity in the US.

8. Denis Quinn and Carla Inclan’s data set ‘Measuring Financial Openness’ also
validates 1980 as a threshold year for the liberalization of international capital
markets.
