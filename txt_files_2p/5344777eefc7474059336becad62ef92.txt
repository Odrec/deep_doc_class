Abstract

Background: Alu elements are major contributors to lineage-specific new exons in primate and human genomes.
Recent studies indicate that some Alu exons have high transcript inclusion levels or tissue-specific splicing profiles,
and may play important regulatory roles in modulating mRNA degradation or translational efficiency. However, the
contribution of Alu exons to the human proteome remains unclear and controversial. The prevailing view is that
exons derived from young repetitive elements, such as Alu elements, are restricted to regulatory functions and have
not had adequate evolutionary time to be incorporated into stable, functional proteins.
Results: We adopt a proteotranscriptomics approach to systematically assess the contribution of Alu exons to the
human proteome. Using RNA sequencing, ribosome profiling, and proteomics data from human tissues and cell
lines, we provide evidence for the translational activities of Alu exons and the presence of Alu exon derived
peptides in human proteins. These Alu exon peptides represent species-specific protein differences between
primates and other mammals, and in certain instances between humans and closely related primates. In the case of
the RNA editing enzyme ADARB1, which contains an Alu exon peptide in its catalytic domain, RNA sequencing
analyses of A-to-I editing demonstrate that both the Alu exon skipping and inclusion isoforms encode active
enzymes. The Alu exon derived peptide may fine tune the overall editing activity and, in limited cases, the site
selectivity of ADARB1 protein products.
Conclusions: Our data indicate that Alu elements have contributed to the acquisition of novel protein sequences
during primate and human evolution.

Background
Transposable elements have played important roles in
the evolution of gene regulation and function [1]. The
primate-specific Alu retrotransposon is
the most
abundant class of transposable elements in the human
genome, with over 1 million copies occupying over 10 %
of the human genomic DNA [2]. Although Alu elements
were historically considered as ‘junk DNA’, extensive re-
search in the past two decades has revealed significant
contributions of Alu to the evolution of the human
genome and gene regulatory networks [1–3].

Alu is a major contributor to de novo origination of
lineage-specific exons in primates [4]. Because the Alu
element contains multiple sites
resemble the
consensus donor and acceptor splice site signals, the in-
sertion of Alu elements into intronic regions of existing
genes produces preferable substrates for subsequent mu-
tations that create and establish new exons [4, 5]. The
exonization of Alu elements is frequent during primate
and human evolution – thousands of human genes con-
tain Alu-derived exon segments in their mRNA tran-
scripts [6, 7]. Although the majority of Alu exons have low
splicing activities and probably represent non-functional
evolutionary intermediates, a subset of Alu exons have
acquired ubiquitously strong or tissue-specific splicing ac-
tivities in human tissues, as demonstrated by recent tran-
scriptome studies using splicing-sensitive exon microarray

and deep RNA sequencing [8, 9]. These ‘established’
Alu exons are preferentially located in the mRNA 5’
untranslated regions (5’-UTR) and may play a role in
regulating mRNA translational efficiency [6, 8, 9]. Alu
exons inserted into coding regions of protein-coding
genes frequently contain premature termination codons
(PTCs) and may provide a mechanism for fine-tuning
steady-state mRNA levels by inducing mRNA nonsense-
mediated decay (NMD) [10]. Together, these data have
established the regulatory roles of Alu exons in multiple
aspects of RNA metabolism including translation and
degradation.

Despite the prevalence of Alu exons in the human
transcriptome, the contribution of Alu exons to the
human proteome remains unclear and controversial
[11–15]. In the 1990s and early 2000s, Makałowski and
others carried out large-scale discoveries of Alu exons in
human genes using cDNA sequences and expressed
sequence tags (ESTs) [11, 12, 16]. They identified nu-
merous instances of ‘in-frame’ Alu exons in the coding
region of human mRNAs that are predicted to add Alu-
derived peptides to the protein products. However, the
presence of an in-frame Alu exon in the mRNA coding
sequence does not guarantee its translation and incorp-
oration into stable protein products. Additionally, since
most Alu exons have low splicing activities [6, 16], even
a ‘translatable’ coding-region Alu exon may only be in-
corporated into a small fraction of the gene’s transcript
products and consequently become largely undetectable
and negligible on the protein level. In fact, in these stud-
ies there was little experimental evidence to support the
existence of Alu-derived peptides in vitro or in vivo. In
2006, Makalowski and colleagues revisited this question
by searching for transposable elements derived peptides in
non-redundant protein entries in the Protein Databank
(PDB) [13]. Since all proteins in PDB have solved 3D
structures, Makalowski and colleagues reasoned that PDB
provides a high-confidence collection of stable, functional
proteins. They did not identify any Alu derived pep-
tides in PDB protein entries. On the basis of this re-
sult, Makalowski and colleagues concluded that exons
derived from Alu or other young repetitive elements
do not have adequate evolutionary time to be incor-
porated into stable protein products, and the role of
Alu exons should be almost entirely regulatory [13].
Since then, this has become the prevailing view on
the contribution of Alu exons to the human proteome
[3, 14, 15, 17]. However, this PDB-based study also
has major drawbacks. Most importantly, PDB has very
limited coverage of alternatively spliced protein isoforms,
and less than 10 protein isoforms had structures deposited
in PDB by the time of this study [18]. When structural bi-
ologists select proteins for structural characterization,
there is an inherent bias towards selecting evolutionarily

conserved protein isoforms and against protein isoforms
with non-conserved (lineage-specific) exon segments such
as Alu exons. Therefore,
the presence of Alu exon
peptides in the human proteome may be significantly
underestimated in the PDB-based analysis. Indeed,
in
gene-specific studies, researchers have found evidence for
the expression of Alu exon peptides in vitro or in vivo –
two examples being the Alu exons in genes encoding the
RNA editing enzyme ADARB1 [19] and DNA methyl-
transferase DNMT1 [20]. Neither case was recapitulated
in the PDB study [13]. In summary, despite substantial
interest in this topic, the real contribution of Alu exons to
the human proteome remains unclear, and past studies
may have reached dramatically different conclusions due
to inherent limitations of their data sources.

In this work, we adopted a proteotranscriptomics ap-
proach to systematically assess the contribution of Alu
exons to the human proteome. Using RNA sequencing
(RNA-seq), ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq), and mass
spectrometry data of diverse human tissues and cell lines,
we evaluated the evidence for the translational activities of
Alu exons and the presence of Alu exon derived peptides
in human proteins.

Results
RNA-seq discovery of putative coding Alu exons with
high splicing activities
RNA-seq has become a powerful approach for quantita-
tive analyses of exon splicing [21]. We previously used an
RNA-seq dataset of human cerebellum to characterize the
splicing profiles of Alu exons [9]. Among Alu exons with
high splicing levels (>50 % exon inclusion) in the cerebel-
lum according to this RNA-seq analysis, the vast majority
(over 80 %) were located in the mRNA 5’-UTR, and only a
handful were located within the protein-coding region [9].
In the present work, to comprehensively identify putative
coding Alu exons and characterize their splicing activities,
we used a much larger RNA-seq dataset with approxi-
mately 1.8 billion RNA-seq reads covering 19 human tis-
sues, including 16 tissues from the Illumina Human Body
Map 2.0 dataset and three tissues from different anatom-
ical compartments of the human placenta (see Materials
and Methods).

We implemented a computational pipeline to identify
putative coding Alu exons with high splicing activities
(Fig. 1a and Materials and Methods). Briefly,
from
transcript annotations, we extracted 1,996

Alu exons were located within the coding sequences
(CDS). To remove Alu exons that would trigger transcript
degradation via mRNA nonsense-mediated decay (NMD),
we further identified 262 coding-region Alu exons that
would not
introduce premature termination codons
(PTCs) within or downstream of the Alu exons when
