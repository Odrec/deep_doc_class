Introduction 

Since the early 1990s the concept of emergence 
received an increasing interest in both cognitive 
science and the philosophy of mind.  
Associated with this concept is the hope 
•  to adequately classify hard philosophical 

problems such as the problem of phenomenal 
qualities, and  

•  to characterize adequately behaviors of artificial 
systems, which are not explicitly programmed, 
but rise from self-organizing processes.

Introduction 

A closer look reveals that we have no unique 
concept of emergence that is apt for both issues.  
ʻCandidatesʼ for emergence in the philosophy of 
mind and in cognitive science fall apart:  
The classification of mental phenomena that resist 
reductive explanations makes use of a very strong 
notion of emergence which is significant for 
metaphysical issues in the philosophy of mind, but 
of low interest to all other disciplines of cognitive 
science.  

3 

Introduction 

Rather, these disciplines refer to the behavior of 
complex dynamical systems that exhibit surprising 
and often unexpected patterns and regularities 
without being resistant to reductive explanations.  
Mostly, their behavior can be explained by 
reference to simple interactions of a multitude of 
simple components.

The Heyday of Emergentism 

What has generally been perceived as the 
ʻheyday of emergentismʼ comprises mainly 
the first half of the 1920s.  
In quick succession, these years saw the 
publication of the main works of British and 
American Emergentism:

Issues 

1.  Which questions do emergentist theories propose 

to answer? Which motivations have led to their 
development? With which positions do they have to 
compete?  

2.  What is the common core of emergentist theories? 

Which claims are indispensible components of 
emergentism? Which variants have to be 
considered? What are their implications?  

3.  Which questions are left unanswered? What new 

problems do arise?  

14 

Varieties of Emergentism 

 Three theories among the different varieties of 
emergentism deserve particular attention:  

•  (strong) synchronic emergentism,  
•  diachronic (structure) emergentism, and  
•  weak (synchronic) emergentism.  

15 

Varieties of Emergentism 

 Weak emergentism specifies the minimal criteria 
for emergent properties. Its three basic features  
–  the thesis of physical monism,  
–  the thesis of systemic (or collective) 

properties, and  

–  the thesis of synchronic determination  
 are perfectly compatible with current reductionist 
approaches.  

16 

Varieties of Emergentism 

The more ambitious theories of emergence have 
their common base in weak emergentism, and can 
be developed by adding further theses.  
Diachronic emergentism acknowledges such 
aspects as novelty and unpredictability.   
Synchronic emergentism refers to the feature of 
irreducibility.  

17 

Weak Emergentism 

The first thesis of current theories of emergence 
concerns the nature of systems that have emergent 
properties.  
According to it, all possible candidates for emergent 
properties such as, e.g., being alive, hearing a D-minor 
accord, or feeling anger, are instantiated only by 
material systems with a sufficiently complex 
microstructure.  

18 

Physical monism 

•  Entities existing or coming into being in the 

universe consist solely of physical constituents. 
•  Properties, dispositions, behaviors, or structures 

classified as emergent are instantiated by 
systems consisting exclusively of physical 
entities. 

19 

Weak Emergentism 

The thesis of physical monism denies that there are 
any supernatural components such as an entelechy or 
a res cogitans responsible for a systemʼs having 
emergent properties.  
Particularly, this means that living or cognizing 
systems – whether artificial or natural – consist of the 
same basic parts as lifeless objects of nature.  

20 

Weak Emergentism 

While the first thesis places emergent properties and 
structures within the framework of a physicalistic 
naturalism, the second thesis – the thesis of systemic 
properties – delimits the type of properties that are 
possible candidates for emergents.  
It is based on the idea that the general properties of a 
complex system fall onto two classes:  
those that some of the systemʼs parts also have, and 
those that none of the systemʼs parts has.  

21 

Systemic properties 

•  Emergent properties are systemic (or collective) 

properties. 

•  A property of a system is systemic if and only if 

the system possesses it but no part of the 
system possesses it. 

22 

Weak Emergentism 

Both artificial and natural systems with systemic 
properties exist.  
Those who would deny their existence would have to 
claim that all of a systemʼs properties are instantiated 
already by some of the systemʼs parts.  
Countless examples refute such a claim.  

23 

Weak Emergentism 

While the first thesis restricts the type of parts out of 
which systems having emergent properties may be 
built, and  
while the second thesis characterizes in more detail 
the type of properties that might be emergent,  
the third thesis specifies the type of relationship that 
holds between a systemʼs microstructure and its 
emergent properties as a relationship of synchronic 
determination:  

24 

Synchronic Determination 

•  A systemʼs properties and its dispositions (to 
behave in a certain way) depend nomologically 
on its microstructure. 

•  There can be no difference in a systemʼs 

systemic properties without some difference in 
the properties of its parts or in the arrangement 
of its parts. 

25 

Weak Emergentism 

Anyone who denies the thesis of synchronic 
determination has either to admit properties of a 
system that are not bound to the properties and 
arrangement of its parts, or to suppose that some 
other factors, in this case non-natural factors, are 
responsible for the different dispositions of systems 
that are identical in their microstructure.  
Both seem implausible.  

26 

Weak Emergence in  
Cognitive Science 
Connectionist networks show cognitive features 
such as  

–  Rule following 
–  Schema formation 
–  Pattern recognition 

these are features their parts do not have. 

27 

Weak Emergence in  
Cognitive Science 
Robots and instantiations of A-life show features 
such as  

–  Wall following 
–  Can collection 
–  Language games (talking heads) 
–  Termite nest building 
–  Flocking behavior of boids 

again, these are features their parts do not have. 

28 

Problems of weak emergentism 
•  Weak emergentism does cut nature at one of its 

joints. 

•  Nevertheless it is not very interesting to classify 

some specific property as weakly emergent. 
•  There exist just too many weakly emergent 

properties. 

29 

Weak Diachronic Emergentism 

Weak emergentism 
+ Novelty 
 
In the context of both evolutionary processes and the 
development of new artifacts, adding the thesis of 
novelty can enrich weak emergentism. 
It makes available a diachronic perspective. 

30 

Novelty 

•  In the course of evolution exemplifications of 

genuine novelties occur again and again.  

•  Existing building blocks develop new 

configurations; new structures are formed that 
constitute new entities with new properties and 
behaviors. 

31 

Weak Diachronic Emergentism 

The thesis of novelty does not by itself turn a weak 
theory of emergence into a strong one, since reductive 
physicalism remains compatible with such a variant of 
emergentism, which we might call weak diachronic 
emergentism.  
Only the addition of the thesis of unpredictability, in 
principle, will lead to stronger forms of diachronic 
emergentism that might be relevant for cognitive 
science.  

32 

The need for strong emergence in  
the philosophy of mind 
•  Can mental properties such as the having  

of  intentional or phenomenal states  
be reductively explained by reference to some 
physical/neuronal base? 

 →  Synchronic emergentism 

33 

Synchronic Emergentism 

Weak emergentism 
+ Irreducibility 
 
A systemic property is irreducible (and thus 
synchronically emergent) if it cannot be  
explained reductively.

Reductive Explanation 

A reductive explanation is successful if the 
following conditions are met 

–  The property to be reduced must be functionally 

construable or reconstruable 

–  It must be shown that the specified role is filled by 

the systemʼs parts and their mutual interactions 
–  The behavior of the systemʼs parts must follow 

from the behavior they show in isolation or in 
simpler systems than the system in question 

36 

Kimʼs Priming procedure 

“To reduce a property M to a domain of base 
properties we must first ʻprimeʼ M for reduction by 
construing, or reconstruing, it relationally or 
extrinsically.  
This turns M into a relational/extrinsic property.” 
(Kim 1998, p. 98).  

37 

Levineʼs two stages 

“Stage 1 involves the (relatively? quasi?) a priori 
process of working the concept of the property to 
be reduced ʻinto shapeʼ for reduction by 
identifying the causal role for which we are seeking 
the underlying mechanisms.  
Stage 2 involves the empirical work of discovering 
just what those underlying mechanisms are.”    
(Levine 1993, p. 132). 

38 

Reduction Task 1 

Given that system S has macro-property P. 
Provide a reductive explanation for P!  

(Refer to the microstructure MS(S), the simple laws 
and the interaction laws that hold true for the 
components Ci of S and show that S must have P. 
Make use of adequate conceptual preparations.)  

39 

Reduction Task 2 

Given a system S with microstructure MS(S). 
Discuss whether or not S has macro-property P!  
If so, show this by a reductive explanation!  

(Refer to the microstructure MS(S), the simple laws 
and the interaction laws that hold true for the 
components Ci of S and show that S must have P. 
Make use of adequate conceptual preparations.)  

40 

Synchronic emergentism 

•  A systemic property is irreducible if (either) 

– 
– 

It is not functionally construable or reconstruable 
It cannot be shown that the interactions between 
the systemʼs parts fill the systemic propertyʼs 
construed (or reconstrued) functional role 

–  The behavior of the systemʼs components, over 

which the systemic property supervenes, does not 
follow from the componentʼs behavior in isolation 
or in simpler configurations 

41 

Emergence in the philosophy of mind 

If you are interested in reductively explaining 
mental phenomena then you better provide 
all you can get as a possible reduction base, 
e.g.,  
– 
the complete physical system 
– 
its parts 
– 
their arrangement and interactions, plus  
–  relevant features of the environment …  

42 

The Problem of Phenomenal Qualities 

(1)  The problem of phenomenal qualities is the 

problem of whether or not phenomenal 
qualities can be reductively explained. 
(2)  Reductive explanations of phenomenal 

qualities afford conceptual reconstruction via 
their causal role.  

(3)  Phenomenal qualities resist their preparation 
for reduction (there are no reconstructions via 
their causal role).  

43 

Reasons for Resistance 

“What seems to be responsible for the explanatory 
gap,  then,  is  the  fact  that  our  concepts  of 
qualitative  character  do  not  represent,  at  least  in 
terms of their psychological contents, causal roles. 
… Thus, to the extent that there is an element in 
our  concept  of  qualitative  character  that  is  not 
captured  by  features  of  its  causal  role,  to  that 
extent  it  will  escape  the  explanatory  net  of  a 
physicalistic reduction.”
(Levine 1993, 134). 

          

44 

  

 

Synchronic emergentism in  
Cognitive Science 
Connectionist networks do not show features that 
are synchronically emergent. 

–  Rule following 
–  Schema formation 
–  Pattern recognition 

are features that are fully deducible from the 
networkʼs structure, the properties of its units 
(their activation formula) and the properties their 
links (the distribution of weights, etc.) 

45 

Synchronic emergentism in  
Cognitive Science 
Neither do robots nor A-life show features that are 
synchronically emergent:  

–  Wall following 
–  Can collection 
–  Language games (talking heads) 
–  Termite nest building 
–  Flocking behavior of boids 

can all be reductively explained. 

46 

Problems of synchronic emergentism 

•  Synchronic emergentism does cut nature at one (or 

• 

the other?) of its joints. 
It is very important for the metaphysical debate 
within philosophy of mind. 

•  Qualia (and some other mental property) might be 

the only properties that are synchronically emergent.  

•  Synchronic emergentism is important for cognitive 

science only when qualia are at issue. 

47 

No “Emergence” for Robots? 

•  Weak emergence is too weak 
•  Synchronic emergence is too strong 
•  What notion of “emergence” cuts the realm of 

artifacts such as robots at the appropriate joints? 

48 

Diachronic structure emergentism 

Structure unpredictability 

–  The rise of a novel structure is unpredictable, in 
principle, if its formation is governed by laws of 
deterministic chaos. 

–  Likewise, any property that is instantiated by the 

novel structure is unpredictable, in principle.
