Introduction: Diverse combinations of built environment (BE) features for physical activity (PA)
are understudied. This study explored whether patterns of GIS-derived BE features explained
objective and self-reported PA, sedentary behavior, and BMI.
Methods: Neighborhood Quality of Life Study participants (N¬º2,199, aged 20‚Äì65 years, 48.2%
female, 26% ethnic minority) were sampled in 2001‚Äì2005 from Seattle / King County WA and
Baltimore MD / Washington DC regions. Their addresses were geocoded to compute net residential
density, land use mix, retail Ô¨Çoor area ratio, intersection density, public transit, and public park and
private recreation facility densities using a 1-km network buffer. Latent proÔ¨Åle analyses (LPAs) were
estimated from these variables. Multilevel regression models compared proÔ¨Åles on accelerometer-
measured moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) and self-reported PA, adjusting for covariates and
clustering. Analyses were conducted in 2013‚Äì2014.

Results: Seattle region LPAs yielded four proÔ¨Åles, including low walkability/transit/recreation
(L-L-L); mean walkability/transit/recreation (M-M-M); moderately high walkability/transit/
recreation (MH-MH-MH); and high walkability/transit/recreation (H-HH). All measures were
higher in the HHH than the LLL proÔ¨Åle (difference of 17.1 minutes/day for MVPA, 146.5
minutes/week for walking for transportation, 58.2 minutes/week for leisure-time PA, and 2.2
BMI points; all po0.05). Baltimore region LPAs yielded four proÔ¨Åles, including L-L-L; M-M-M;
high land use mix, transit, and recreation (HLU-HT-HRA); and high intersection density, high
retail Ô¨Çoor area ratio (HID-HRFAR). HLU-HT-HRA and L-L-L differed by 12.3 MVPA
minutes/day; HID-HRFAR and L-L-L differed by 157.4 minutes/week for walking for trans-
portation (all po0.05).
Conclusions: Patterns of environmental features explain greater differences in adults‚Äô PA than the
four-component walkability index.

Introduction

M ost Americans do not meet physical activity

(PA) guidelines.1 People live in neighbor-
hoods that are mosaics of modiÔ¨Åable2,3 built
environment (BE) features (e.g., walkability, access to
public transportation, public park, private recreation
facilities).4‚Äì7 Such features have been individually and
consistently linked to PA among adults8‚Äì13 and have
shown behavior-speciÔ¨Åc associations with different
domains of PA (e.g., recreation, transportation).8,13‚Äì17
Mixed evidence exists for relations of BEs with sedentary
behaviors and obesity.18‚Äì22

design of NQLS has been described previously.4,37 First, Census
block groups in each region were screened based on the BE
construct of walkability‚ÄîdeÔ¨Åned by GIS-derived measures of net
residential density, land use mix, street connectivity, and retail
Ô¨Çoor area ratio (RFAR). Block groups were classiÔ¨Åed according to
deciles of walkability scores and Census-derived median house-
hold income, which were used to form a 2 (high versus low
walkability) X 2 (high income versus low income) matrix, with
eight neighborhoods per cell in each region.4 Second, participants
(N¬º2,199, aged 20‚Äì65 years, 48.2% female, 26% racial/ethnic
minority) were systematically sampled and recruited across all four
cells simultaneously over 12 months in each region to prevent
seasonal bias. IRBs from participating institutions approved the
study. Participants provided written informed consent.

Emerging evidence suggests greater diversity of BE
features23,24 and unique combinations of features25 may
explain differences in PA and obesity better than
individual features. Combinations of diverse neighbor-
hood features have not been studied as often as single
features in relation to PA domains.26 Capturing complex
patterns of diverse features that include walkability,
transportation, and recreation features is a challenge.

Modern geodemographic methods23 for characterizing
patterns of BE features in neighborhoods include factor
analysis,27‚Äì29 modeling statistical interactions,30 or clas-
sifying individuals into subgroups based on multidimen-
sional patterns with techniques such as latent proÔ¨Åle
analysis (LPA).25,31 LPA is a probability-based approach
for grouping individuals based on patterns of responses
across variables. LPA can help identify patterns of
features that show functionally different relationships
with PA and other health outcomes.

Few studies have explored patterns of BE features. Two
studies of adults found that patterns of perceived BE
features supportive of PA had the highest moderate to
vigorous PA (MVPA) and walking for transportation and
recreation levels compared with unsupportive pat-
terns.25,32 Studies suggest that certain combinations of
self-reported BE features were more strongly related to
meeting PA guidelines in adults than any single fac-
tor.33,34 Three studies examined objectively measured BE
features for adolescents‚Äô PA,31,35,36 but none examined
objectively measured features for adults‚Äô PA.

The current study examined whether unique patterns
of BE features could be derived from a combination of
seven GIS-measured indicators using LPA among adult
residents in two metropolitan regions. Based on previous
research,25,32 we hypothesized that multiple proÔ¨Åles
would emerge, with at least one in each region reÔ¨Çecting
an overall PA-supportive pattern. Our second aim was to
examine how proÔ¨Åles related to accelerometer-measured
PA and sedentary time, as well as self-reported PA,
sedentary time, and BMI, after adjusting for covariates.
We hypothesized that participants in neighborhoods
characterized by an overall activity-supportive proÔ¨Åle,
compared with the other proÔ¨Åles, would have the highest
PA and lowest sedentary time and BMI.

Methods
Study Sample

This analysis used data collected between 2001 and 2005 from the
Neighborhood Quality of Life Study (NQLS),37 an observational
study of BEs and health-related outcomes (e.g., PA, BMI)
conducted in 32 neighborhoods from metropolitan Seattle / King
County WA and Baltimore MD / Washington DC regions (here-
after referred to as ‚ÄúSeattle‚Äù and ‚ÄúBaltimore,‚Äù respectively). The

Neighborhood Environment Measures
Because proximal environments around participants‚Äô homes may
be more important than the overall block group environment,18
ESRI‚Äôs ArcGIS, version 10.0, was used to geocode participants‚Äô
residences and measure seven features within 1-km street‚Äìnetwork
buffers uniquely for each residence.

Neighborhood walkability4 represents an indicator of

local

accessibility and destinations near home, composed of

1. net residential density‚Äîratio of residential dwelling units to

land area devoted to residential land use;

2. street connectivity‚Äînumber of intersections with three or
land area‚Äîhigher intersection
more legs divided by total
density corresponds to more direct paths between destinations;
3. land use mix‚Äîdiversity and evenness of accessible destinations
based on Ô¨Åve land use types (residential, retail/commercial,
entertainment, food-related, and civic/institutional‚Äîincluding
medical and government); values ranged from 0 (single land
use) to 1 (even distribution across all Ô¨Åve types); and

4. RFAR‚Äîratio of retail building Ô¨Çoor areas divided by retail
parcel land areas‚Äîlow RFAR is a marker for areas with retail
development likely accompanied by substantial parking space,
whereas high RFAR is a marker for buildings with smaller set-
backs from the street, indicating pedestrian-oriented design.

Individual walkability components were included as four

separate indicators in LPAs.

Access to public transportation has differed strongly between
neighborhoods and is predictive of PA,32,38,39 suggesting its impor-
tance for characterizing neighborhoods. Transit and bus stop
locations were obtained from transit providers and regional planning
agencies. Transit density (combined bus and rail) was deÔ¨Åned as the
number of stops/stations in a buffer divided by its land area.

A comprehensive enumeration of parks, Ô¨Åtness centers, com-
munity recreation centers, swimming pools, and yoga and ball-
room dance studios was conducted using information from park
departments, parcel databases, and online and print business
listings. Parks were deÔ¨Åned as freely accessible, improved, and
unimproved green spaces based on these sources. Private recre-
ation facilities included places where PA could occur and required
payment (e.g., golf courses, Ô¨Åtness facilities, dance studios).
Separate park density and private recreation density variables
were calculated as the number of locations divided by the buffer‚Äôs
land area.

Measures

Adams et al / Am J Prev Med 2015;49(6):878‚Äì887

Participants wore ActiGraph accelerometers (Pensacola, FL; model
7164 or 71256) on their right hip using an elastic belt during
waking hours for 7 days to measure MVPA. Participants were
asked to re-wear the accelerometer if o5 valid days or o66 valid
hours across 7 days were obtained. Accelerometer data were scored
using MeterPlus, version 4.0 (www.meterplussoftware.com), and a
‚Äúvalid day‚Äù was deÔ¨Åned as Z8 valid hours of wear, with non-wear
deÔ¨Åned as Z30 consecutive minutes of zero activity counts. On
valid days, within valid wearing time, each minute r100 counts
was summed to compute total sedentary minutes. The duration of
MVPA minutes was based on the 1-minute epochs and the
Freedson 3-MET cut point for adults (Z1,952 counts).40 Average
minutes of sedentary time and MVPA per valid wearing day, plus a
dichotomous indicator of attaining 430 minutes/day of MVPA
(approximating the 150 minutes/week guideline) were used in
analyses. ActiGraph accelerometers have produced reliable and
valid estimates of sedentary time41 and MVPA42 in adults.

Participants completed the International Physical Activity
Questionnaire (IPAQ) long form assessing walking for trans-
portation, leisure-time PA, and sitting time over the last 7 days
(IPAQ; www.ipaq.ki.se). Sitting time (minutes/week) was esti-
mated from asking about time usually spent sitting on a weekday
and on a weekend day and was operationalized as the weighted
sum of Ô¨Åve times the usual sitting minutes/day on weekdays plus
two times the usual minutes/day on weekend days. Leisure-time
PA (minutes/week) was operationalized as the sum of frequency
(days/week) X duration (minutes/day) of walking, moderate-
intensity PA, and vigorous-intensity PA. A similar measure was
computed for usual minutes/week (i.e., days/week X minutes/day)
of walking for transportation. IPAQ reliability (œÅ¬º0.80) and
validity (œÅ¬º0.30) was similar to other self-reported PA measures
when compared to accelerometers.43 Self-reported weight and
height were used to calculate BMI.

Participants answered questionnaire items assessing sex; age
(years); race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white versus non-white or
Hispanic); annual household income (11 levels from o10,000 to
4100,000); educational attainment (seven levels from seventh
grade to completed graduate degree); number of motor vehicles
and eligible drivers in household (continuous); marital or cohab-
itation status (married or living together versus other); number of
people in household (continuous); and years at current address
(continuous).

Statistical Analysis

We used LPA to derive mutually exclusive proÔ¨Åles of observa-
tions (i.e., patterns) that maximized between-class variance and
minimized within-class variance across seven continuous indi-
cators of neighborhood features. Adjustments were made for
block group‚Äìlevel clustering via TYPE¬ºCOMPLEX speciÔ¨Åcation
under Mplus, version 7.11. LPA models were estimated sepa-
rately in each region (Seattle, n¬º1,287; Baltimore, n¬º912) using
net residential density, land use mix, intersection density, RFAR,
transit density, park density, and private recreation density.
Derived solutions ranged from one to Ô¨Åve proÔ¨Åles or until model
convergence was not obtained. Selection of proÔ¨Åle solutions was
based on substantive interpretability, indices of model Ô¨Åt, and
within-proÔ¨Åle sample sizes. Relative model Ô¨Åt and quality was

judged using sample size‚Äìadjusted Bayesian information crite-
rion (BIC) values. Upon selection of an appropriate and
interpretable LPA solution for each region, respondents were
assigned to the proÔ¨Åle for which their analytically derived
probability of membership was highest.

Next, using generalized linear mixed models in SAS, version 9.3,

we examined relations of proÔ¨Åle membership to:

1. meeting MVPA recommendations (PROC GLIMMIX);
2. log-transformed accelerometer-measured MVPA and seden-

tary minutes/day (2-4 PROC MIXED);

3. log-transformed self-reported PA minutes/week (i.e., walking
for transportation, leisure-time) and sitting time minutes per
week; and

4. BMI.

As in the LPA step, analyses were conducted separately by
region, and individual respondents were treated as nested within
block groups. Block group‚Äìlevel
intercepts were modeled as
random effects. All analyses adjusted for the aforementioned
demographic variables and accelerometer wear time when appro-
priate. Figures present model-adjusted means, and for analyses of
log-transformed measures, Ô¨Ågures show anti-logged means and SE
bars. The Appendix describes sedentary and BMI results. Analyses
were conducted between 2013 and 2014.

Results

Seattle and Baltimore region participants on demo-
graphic and personal characteristics, PA and sedentary
times, and neighborhood environment factors.
Model Ô¨Åt values indicated that a Ô¨Åve-proÔ¨Åle solution
(BIC¬º30,800.7) was better than a four-proÔ¨Åle solution
(BIC¬º31,424.3) in Seattle;

ence of very small proportions and potentially unreliable
estimates of the region‚Äôs sample in Ô¨Åve-proÔ¨Åle solutions,
four-proÔ¨Åle solutions for both Seattle and Baltimore were
more plausible. Figures 1A and 1B present Ô¨Ånal proÔ¨Åles

mon proÔ¨Åle for Baltimore had low
walkability,
low transit access, and
low recreation access (‚ÄúL-L-L‚Äù) and
comprised 53.6% (n=489) of partic-

Ô¨Åle, characterized by near mean levels
of walkability, transit, and recreation
access (‚ÄúM-M-M‚Äù) for the region,
included 36.6% (n=334) of partici-
pants. The third proÔ¨Åle, characterized
most prominently by high land use
mix, high transit access, and high
recreation access (‚ÄúHLU-HT-HRA‚Äù),
included 6.9% (n=63) of participants.
The smallest proÔ¨Åle included 2.9%
(n=26) of participants and also had
high residential density, but was dis-

high intersection density and RFAR
(‚ÄúHID-HRFAR‚Äù) values.

cantly in Seattle but not Baltimore. In Seattle, H-H-H
(117.3 minutes/week) and MH-MH-MH (88.5 minutes/

ipants. Figure 4 presents adjusted BMI values across

Discussion
Meaningful activity-supportive proÔ¨Åles emerged from
seven GIS-measured environmental variables and were
positively and strongly related to accelerometer-derived
MVPA; walking for transportation; leisure-time PA; and
BMI (albeit less consistently). Relations between proÔ¨Åles
and sedentary time were not supported.

In contrast to the main NQLS outcome analysis,37 the
current analysis examined patterns and a more-diverse
set of objective features within regions. In the main
NQLS analysis, participants from block groups ranked as
high versus low on GIS-measured walkability differed
signiÔ¨Åcantly by a maximum of 5.8 minutes/day for
accelerometer-measured MVPA, 31.5 minutes/week for
walking for transportation, 4.3 minutes/week for leisure-
time PA, and non-signiÔ¨Åcantly by 0.4 points for BMI.37
In the current analysis, Seattle region proÔ¨Åles differed by
as much as 17.1 minutes/day for accelerometer-
measured MVPA, 147.0 minutes/week for walking for
transportation, 57.6 minutes/week for leisure-time PA,
and 2.2 points for BMI. Baltimore proÔ¨Åles differed by as
much as 12.3 accelerometer-measured MVPA minutes/
day and 157.2 minutes/week for walking for trans-
portation. Relative to the main NQLS analyses, the
latent proÔ¨Åles explained at least a twofold difference in

MVPA minutes/day, approximately Ô¨Åvefold difference
in both walking for transportation minutes/week and
BMI, and 13-fold difference in leisure activity minutes/
week.

Differences between current and main NQLS results

could be explained by

1. operationalizing neighborhood as a 1-km network
buffer (versus block group), as block groups can
include features made inaccessible by barriers like
freeways or rivers and can exclude accessible features
just across block group boundaries;

2. inclusion of transit, parks, and recreation facilities,
allowing for more-complex BE patterns to emerge and
contributing to a more-comprehensive picture of
neighborhoods;

3. speciÔ¨Åc feature patterns resulting from the LPA

methodology; or

4. some combination of these methodologic components.

In sum, region-speciÔ¨Åc latent proÔ¨Åles explained greater
differences in PA than the four-component block group
walkability index.37

There were regional similarities and differences in
emergent proÔ¨Åles. In both regions, we identiÔ¨Åed activity-
unsupportive proÔ¨Åles (i.e., L-L-L) and a type of activity-
supportive proÔ¨Åle (i.e., H-H-H or HLU-HT-HRA). In
both regions,
the largest proportion of participants
resided in PA-unsupportive neighborhoods, whereas
the fewest resided in activity-supportive neighborhoods.
This is not surprising, as U.S. cities are known to have a
high prevalence of sprawl and limited recreation and
transit access compared with other countries.24,44,45
ProÔ¨Åles suggest that improving pedestrian access to
destinations, transit, public parks, and recreation facili-
ties may result
in progressively higher MVPA and
walking for transportation in both regions compared

Figure 4. Adjusted means for BMI by latent proÔ¨Åle in Seattle WA and Baltimore MD / Washington DC regions.
Note: BMI adjusted for sex, age, race/ethnicity, annual household income, educational attainment, number of motor vehicles and eligible drivers in
household, marital or cohabitation status, number of people in household, and years at current address; Within each panel, non-signiÔ¨Åcant
comparisons are reÔ¨Çected across proÔ¨Åles by bars with matching colors or matching patterns. Values reÔ¨Çect model-adjusted means and SE bars.

BMI, the signiÔ¨Åcant differences in Seattle and lack of
differences in Baltimore across proÔ¨Åles are difÔ¨Åcult to
explain, but may be a function of speciÔ¨Åc feature
combinations in ‚Äúactivity-supportive‚Äù proÔ¨Åles, relatively
lower street connectivity in HLU-HT-HRA, or unmeas-
ured aspects such as lack of amenities, trafÔ¨Åc, or safety
concerns modulating use of recreation environments or
lack of nutrition environments for BMI. Results for
sedentary behavior support previous mixed Ô¨Åndings.18‚Äì22
LPA studies of self-reported feature combinations among
U.S. adults,25 older adults,32 and international samples34
parallel the current analysis by including perceived indicators
of walkability, public transit, and recreation features, but
differ by including aspects difÔ¨Åcult to measure objectively
such as aesthetics, crime and trafÔ¨Åc safety, and pedestrian/
cycling facilities. Latent proÔ¨Åle/class analyses based on self-
reported measures also have identiÔ¨Åed activity-unsupportive
and -supportive proÔ¨Åles across a diverse set of measures.
Consistent with present
results, perceived activity-
unsupportive proÔ¨Åles had the greatest proportion of people
and lowest PA levels compared with higher levels of
supportive features. LPA using self-reported and objective
BE measures agree that more-comprehensive characteriza-
tions of environments strengthen associations with both
objective and self-reported PA. BMI results are inconsistent,
perhaps because of lack of nutrition environment measures.

Limitations
Similar results for objective and self-reported PA
measures
limit concerns of common source bias.
Analyses controlled for design effects and several

December 2015

variables,

robust

suggesting

confounding
results.
Because cross-sectional designs do not allow for evalu-
ation of cause‚Äìeffect relations, future studies should
examine the utility of
latent proÔ¨Åles for predicting
changes to PA and incidence of health outcomes.
Residential self-selection was not accounted for, and
we could not conÔ¨Årm that participants engaged in PA
inside of neighborhoods. Previous studies suggest self-
selection may attenuate, but not extinguish, the effect of
the BE on PA. Amenities available in parks, transit
service levels, and other microscale and qualitative
features (e.g., sidewalks or safety from trafÔ¨Åc and crime)
could have produced a different number or pattern of
proÔ¨Åles; unfortunately, objective measures of
these
aspects were unavailable.

Conclusions
Current results add to growing evidence that more-
comprehensive characterizations of BE strengthen
associations with PA. Walkability, recreation, and
transit features of neighborhood environments should
be measured and considered in planning and policy
decisions.
