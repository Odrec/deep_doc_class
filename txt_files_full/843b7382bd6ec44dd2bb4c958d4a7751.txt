Abstract

We present a new empirical decomposition of the eﬀects of ﬁnancial liberalization on economic
growth and on the incidence of crises. Our empirical estimates show that the direct eﬀect of ﬁnancial
liberalization on growth by far outweighs the indirect eﬀect via a higher propensity to crisis. We also
discuss several models of ﬁnancial liberalization and growth whose predictions are consistent with
our empirical ﬁndings.

another view, liberalization induces excessive risk-taking, increases macroeconomic vola-
tility and leads to more frequent crises.

In this paper we propose an empirical framework that brings these two views together.
We decompose the impact of international ﬁnancial liberalization on growth into two
eﬀects: a positive direct eﬀect and a negative indirect eﬀect through a higher propensity
to crisis. We ﬁnd that the direct growth gain of ﬁnancial liberalization signiﬁcantly out-
weighs the growth loss associated with more frequent ﬁnancial crises. On net, the eﬀect
of ﬁnancial liberalization on growth is economically sizeable: around 1% increase in
per-capita annual growth rate.

The eﬀect of ﬁnancial liberalization on growth and its impact on ﬁnancial fragility and
the propensity to crises have been largely studied in separate strands of the empirical lit-
erature. The ﬁnancial crisis literature tests whether ﬁnancial liberalization increase the risk
of ﬁnancial crises. Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999), Demirguc-Kunt and Detragiache
(1998), Glick and Hutchinson (2001) ﬁnd that the propensity to banking and currency cri-
ses increases in the aftermath of ﬁnancial liberalization. In contrast, the literature on lib-
eralization and growth focuses on identifying the eﬀects of liberalization on average long-
run growth. For instance, Bekaert et al. (2005) ﬁnd that stock market liberalization leads
to an increase of one percentage point in average GDP growth.1 Henry (2000) conﬁrms
this result at the ﬁrm level by showing that ﬁnancial liberalization leads to an investment
boom associated with a decline in the cost of capital.

The goal of this paper is not to perform another test of the eﬀect of ﬁnancial liberaliza-
tion on growth. Instead, its main contribution is to develop an integrated framework to
empirically quantify and contrast the dual eﬀects of ﬁnancial liberalization: on the one
hand, ﬁnancial liberalization tends to relax borrowing constraints, leading to higher
investment and higher average growth; on the other hand, it encourages risk-taking, gen-
erates ﬁnancial fragility and increases the probability of ﬁnancial crises, which often have
severe recessionary consequences.

The contrasting experiences of Thailand and India illustrate the dual eﬀects of ﬁnancial
liberalization. Thailand, a ﬁnancially liberalized economy, has experienced lending booms
and crises, while India, a non-liberalized economy, has followed a slow but safe growth
path (see Fig. 1). In India GDP per capita grew by only 99% between 1980 and 2001,
whereas Thailand’s GDP per capita grew by 148%, despite having experienced a major
crisis.

We believe that analyzing the eﬀects of ﬁnancial liberalization in a uniﬁed way is impor-
tant. The division of the empirical literature on ﬁnancial liberalization between the anal-
ysis of the crises and the growth eﬀects has several disadvantages. First, each strand
provides only a partial account on the eﬀect of ﬁnancial liberalization. The crisis view
stresses the severity of the output costs of ﬁnancial crises, but largely ignores its growth
beneﬁts during tranquil times. The growth view relies on the estimation of linear
growth eﬀects of ﬁnancial liberalization. This linear approach captures only the average
growth eﬀect across the booms and busts generated by ﬁnancial liberalization. The second
disadvantage is that each strand has produced its own set of policy implications. Research-

1 They also identify a similar growth eﬀect of capital account liberalization using a measure of the intensity of

capital account openness proposed by Quinn (1997).

ers emphasizing the long-run growth eﬀect advocate ﬁnancial liberalization policies, while
researchers that concentrate on crises caution against excessive ﬁnancial liberalization.

Section 2 contains our empirical ﬁndings. Section 3 discusses theoretical mechanisms

consistent with our empirical results. Section 4 concludes.

2. Financial liberalization, crises and growth: An empirical decomposition

We propose a methodology to decompose the eﬀect of ﬁnancial liberalization on
growth into two channels: a direct growth channel and an indirect fragility channel.
The latter eﬀect captures a higher frequency of crises and the associated costs in terms
of lower growth. The main advantage of this approach is that it allows us to quantitatively
compare the expected growth beneﬁts of ﬁnancial liberalization in normal times with the
growth costs stemming from a greater vulnerability to crises.

2.1. Empirical methodology

Our empirical strategy consists of adding to a standard growth regression a ﬁnancial
liberalization dummy and a ﬁnancial crisis dummy. Furthermore, we treat the ﬁnancial
crisis dummy as an endogenous variable that depends on several variables including ﬁnan-
cial liberalization. In this set-up, the impact of ﬁnancial liberalization on growth is com-
posed of two eﬀects: (i) a direct eﬀect on growth conditional on a standard set of control
variables and on the absence of ﬁnancial crisis, and (ii) an indirect eﬀect reﬂecting the
growth costs associated with a higher propensity to ﬁnancial crises.

Formally, the empirical speciﬁcation combines a growth model and a crisis model. The
growth model has the following panel form with i indexing the country and t indexing the
time period:

i;t þ ei;t;

yi;t ¼ aX i;t þ bFLi;t þ cI crisis

ð1Þ
where yi,t is real per-capita GDP growth, Xi,t is a set of control variables standard in the
growth literature, FLi,t is a dummy for ﬁnancial liberalization, and I crisis
is a dummy var-
iable taking on a value of one if country i experiences a ﬁnancial crisis in period t and zero
otherwise. Lastly, ei,t is a random component.

where U is the cumulative distribution function of a standard normal. Thus, the para-
meters of the crisis model can be estimated using a probit model.

Notice that the mixed model described by (1) and (2) is equivalent to a treatment eﬀects
model for which standard estimation techniques have been developed (see Heckman (1978)
and Maddala (1983)).

2.1.1. Estimation procedure

In the treatment eﬀects model representation, the crisis dummy captures the ‘‘treat-
ment’’, the growth regression (1) is the ‘‘outcome’’ equation and regression (2) is the
‘‘treatment’’ equation representing the likelihood to receive the treatment.2 As shown by
Maddala (1983), the model can be consistently estimated using a two-step procedure under
the assumption that the error terms ei,t and git are bivariate normal but not independent.
In the ﬁrst step, one obtains probit estimates of the probability of crisis:

PrðI crisis

i;t ¼ 1Þ ¼ PrðW 

it > 0Þ ¼ Uðazi;t þ bFLi;tÞ

ð3Þ
where U is the standard normal cumulative distribution function. Using the probit
estimates ð^a; ^bÞ, one computes a hazard hi,t for each observation.3 In the second step,
one obtains consistent estimates for the parameters (a, b, c) of the growth model by aug-
menting regression (1) with the hazard hi,t.4

The total eﬀect of ﬁnancial liberalization, the impact of a change in the ﬁnancial liber-
alization dummy from zero to one, is the sum of a direct eﬀect (c) and an indirect eﬀect due
to a change in the probability of crisis:

2 Edwards (2004) us a similar framework to assess the impact of a sudden stop on growth, as do Razin and

Rubinstein (2006) to study the growth eﬀect of exchange rate regimes in the presence of a currency crisis.

As discussed in the introduction, the existing empirical literature on ﬁnancial liberaliza-
tion has focused either on the estimation of variations of the growth model, using linear
techniques, or on the estimation of the crisis model using a probit speciﬁcation. In con-
trast, our procedure allows us to jointly estimate the linear growth regression model
and the probit model of crisis.

Based on the literature, e.g. Bekaert et al. (2005) and Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999),
our prior is that the direct eﬀect of ﬁnancial liberalization on growth is positive, while
the indirect eﬀect – via a greater likelihood of crisis – is negative.

The non-linearity of the probit speciﬁcation is, in principle, suﬃcient to identify the
model and, in particular, to distinguish the direct from the indirect eﬀect of ﬁnancial lib-
eralization. However, Arellano (2006) shows that such an empirical strategy is likely to
result in weak identiﬁcation. Hence, we introduce in the probit regression some variables
that are excluded from the growth regression.5,6

The selection of the probit model speciﬁcation is done using the Aikaike information
criterion. In the probit equation we initially include, along with the ﬁnancial liberalization
dummy, all the control variables from the growth regression and the excluded variables in
their the ﬁrst, second and third lags. We then select the speciﬁcation that minimizes the
Aikaike criterion. Finally, the standard errors in both the growth estimates and the probit
estimates are clustered at
to
heteroskedasticity.

the country level and are adjusted to be robust

The speciﬁcation of the growth model and the crisis model at the same annual fre-
quency is convenient for the estimation. A disadvantage is that the estimation of the
growth equation using annual data does not allow us to ﬁlter out ﬂuctuations at the busi-
ness cycle frequency. To deal with this issue, we modify the model to combine a growth
equation estimated using ﬁve-year averages with a probit crisis model estimated at an
annual frequency. The ﬁrst step of the estimation – the probit regression – is identical,
but the second step is modiﬁed to take into account the possibility that a country is hit
by a crisis in any given year during the ﬁve-year interval.

2.2. Data

The sample consists of a set of sixty countries for which we have information on the
dates of ﬁnancial crises and ﬁnancial liberalization over the period 1980–2002. The com-
plete description of the sources and the construction of the variables used in the regression
analysis are presented in Appendix A.

We use two sources for the dates of ﬁnancial liberalization: a de jure binary indicator is
constructed using the oﬃcial dates of equity market liberalization described in Bekaert et al.
(2005), and a de facto binary indicator is based on the identiﬁcation of country-speciﬁc

5 The excluded regressors are chosen among variables that have been found to be robust determinants of crises,

but do not seem to have a systematic independent linear eﬀect on growth.

6 As a robustness check, we also estimate the treatment eﬀects model without any exclusion restrictions.

trend breaks in private capital ﬂows.7 We view these two indicators as providing comple-
mentary information on the process of ﬁnancial liberalization. The de jure indicator iden-
tiﬁes the timing of a formal regulatory change that allows foreign investors to invest in
domestic equity securities. The de facto indicator detects the timing of an actual change
in the pattern of foreign inﬂows and it covers portfolio ﬂows, bank ﬂows and foreign direct
investments. Appendix C presents the dates of liberalization for the countries in the sample.
We chose to focus on ﬁnancial crises that are characterized by the coincidence of a
banking crisis and a currency crisis. The main reason for this is that these so-called ‘‘twin’’
crises are largely concentrated in ﬁnancially liberalized economies. The Mexican and Asian
crises are the most prominent examples of twin crises but, actually, the incidence of twin
crises has been relatively widespread, occurring in such diverse parts of the world as in
Latin America in the early and mid-1980s and in Scandinavia in the early 1990s. The twin
crisis dummy variable is obtained by combining the systemic banking crises indicator of
Caprio and Klingebiel (2003) and the currency crises indicator of Glick and Hutchinson
(2001).8 Caprio and Klingebiel (2003) deﬁne a systemic banking crisis as a situation where
the aggregate value of the banking system liabilities exceeds the value of its assets. Glick
and Hutchinson (2001) construct an indicator of currency crises based on large changes in
an index of currency pressure, deﬁned as a weighted average of real exchange rate changes
and reserve losses. 9 Appendix C presents the dates of twin crises for the countries in the
sample.

The dependent variable in the growth model is computed as the log diﬀerence in real per
capita income. The set of controls for the growth equation is standard and includes initial
per capita income, population growth, government size, trade openness and inﬂation. As
discussed in Section 2.1, the list of potential explanatory variables in the probit equation
includes the regressors of the growth equation. It also contains the two following variables
that are excluded from the growth equation: a measure of real exchange rate overvaluation
computed as deviation from a HP trend and the ratio of M2 to reserves. All the variables
are introduced as their ﬁrst, second and third lags. The minimization of the Aikaike crite-
rion selects the ﬁnal list of crises determinants and the optimal lag structure.

2.3. Estimation results

The estimation results based on a growth and a crisis model estimated using annual
data are presented in Table 1. The top panel shows the estimates of the growth equation,
while the bottom panel presents the estimates of the probit equation. Speciﬁcation [1]
includes the de jure ﬁnancial liberalization index, while speciﬁcation [2] includes the de
facto liberalization index.10
The main results can be summarized as follows. First, ﬁnancial liberalization has a
direct positive eﬀect on per capita GDP growth ð^b > 0Þ. This eﬀect is signiﬁcant at the

7 See Appendix B for a description of the construction of the de facto index.
8 We extend the time coverage of the currency crisis indicator to include the period 2000–2002.
9 Large changes in exchange rate pressure are deﬁned as changes in the pressure index exceeding the mean by

more than twice the country-speciﬁc standard deviation.
10 The selection of the probit model speciﬁcation is done according to the Aikaike criterion which explains why
the set of explanatory variables diﬀers between [1] and [2]. Notice that the ratio of M2/Reserves has been included
in the initial probit equation but has not been selected in the speciﬁcation that minimizes the Aikaike criterion.

de facto index. Second, the incidence of twin crises, estimated through the probit equation,
has a negative impact on growth ð^c < 0Þ. The point estimate of ^c –i.e. the reduction in
growth conditional on experiencing a crisis– is in the range ( 0.099,  0.11). This range
is consistent with ﬁndings in the crisis literature.

Third, ﬁnancial liberalization signiﬁcantly increases the probability of a twin crisis.11
Real exchange rate overvaluation, inﬂation and openness to trade are also associated with
a higher probability of crisis. As the probit model is non-linear, the partial eﬀect of a
change in one variable on the crisis probability depends on the value of the other variables.
For our purpose, we are interested in the average partial eﬀect of ﬁnancial liberalization on
the crisis probability: EfUð^azi;t þ ^bÞ   Uð^azi;tÞg. This measure indicates that ﬁnancial liber-
alization is on average associated with an increase in the probability of a twin crisis by 1.45
percentage point for the de facto index and by 1.93 percentage point for the de jure
index.12
We compute the indirect growth cost of ﬁnancial liberalization on annual per capita
GDP growth by multiplying the estimate of the growth cost of a crisis ð^cÞ by the average
partial eﬀect of ﬁnancial liberalization on the crisis probability ðEfUð^azi;t þ ^bÞ   Uð^azi;tÞgÞ.
This indirect growth cost ranges from  0.14 to  0.19 percentage points of annual growth,
meaning that it is ﬁve to seven times smaller than the direct growth eﬀect.

Table 2 summarizes the decomposition of the eﬀects of ﬁnancial liberalization on
growth. The total growth eﬀect of ﬁnancial liberalization is slightly below 1 percentage
point of annual GDP growth, a magnitude in line with previous estimates in the
literature.13

As a ﬁrst robustness test, we check whether our results survive if the growth equation is
estimated using data averaged in ﬁve-year intervals. In Table 3, we present the results of
the estimation of a modiﬁed version of the treatment eﬀects model where the probit crisis
model is estimated at an annual frequency while the growth model is estimated using a
panel of data averaged over ﬁve-year non overlapping intervals.14 The period of estima-
tion covers 1981–2000 and contains four ﬁve-year intervals.

In the ﬁve-year average panel, the index of ﬁnancial liberalization and the index of
ﬁnancial crises in the growth equation represent the fraction of years during which a

11 The estimated diﬀerence in the probability of a twin crisis associated with a change from zero to one of the
ﬁnancial liberalization dummy is given by Uð^azi;t þ ^bÞ   Uð^azi;tÞ. Hence ^b > 0 means that ﬁnancial liberalization
increases ceteris paribus the probability of a crisis.
12 In our sample the annual unconditional probability of a twin crisis is 2.3%.
13 For instance, Bekaert et al. (2005), using a de facto index, ﬁnd that ﬁnancial liberalization leads to a one
percentage point increase in annual growth.

country has been liberalized or has experienced a crisis within a ﬁve-year interval. Since the
two-step estimates of the growth model
in ﬁve-year averages are computed using
the results of the probit model presented in Table 1, we only report the estimates for
the growth equation in Table 3. The results are similar to the ones obtained using data
at annual frequency. The direct eﬀect of ﬁnancial liberalization is almost identical while
the growth costs of crises are slightly more pronounced. The growth eﬀect of inﬂation is
now insigniﬁcant while the eﬀect of trade openness becomes stronger. The other regressors
have more or less the same impact. Table 4 presents the decomposition of the eﬀects of

3340

ﬁnancial liberalization on growth. In comparison to the growth model estimated with
annual data, both the direct growth beneﬁt and the indirect growth cost are a little higher
but the resulting total eﬀect is very similar for both the de jure index and the de facto
index.

As a second robustness check, we introduce the measure of real exchange rate overvalu-
ation in the growth equation in speciﬁcation [1] in Table 3. As we suppress the only exclu-
sion restriction, the non-linearity of the probit model becomes the only source of
identiﬁcation of the model. We ﬁnd that the eﬀect of real exchange rate overvaluation
on growth is negative but very small and insigniﬁcant. Our main results survive in this
speciﬁcation although both the direct and the indirect eﬀects of ﬁnancial liberalization
on growth are slightly weaker (+0.94% and  0.13%).

2.4. Country estimates

To illustrate our results, we now turn to country speciﬁc estimates of the treatment
eﬀect model, restricting the analysis to the subset of countries that experienced ﬁnancial
liberalization within the sample period. First, we ﬁt the model to the data in order to
obtain the predicted growth rate and the predicted probability of crisis for each country
and each year.15 Second, for each country we compute the mean predicted growth rate
and the mean probability of crisis before and after ﬁnancial liberalization. Using these
mean values, for each country we compute : (i) the predicted change in growth between
the pre and post-liberalization period; and (ii) the predicted change in the indirect growth
cost of crisis between the pre and post-liberalization periods.

The results are presented in Fig. 2. For most of the countries, the predicted change in
growth is between 1 and 1.5 percentage points. This change is slightly higher than the
marginal total eﬀect of ﬁnancial liberalization, as it also reﬂects changes in the other
regressors, such as an increase in trade openness. In comparison,
the predicted
change in the indirect growth cost of a crisis is much smaller, around  0.25 percentage
points.16

Finally, Fig. 3 contrasts the change in growth between the pre and post-liberalization
period predicted by the treatment eﬀect model with the change observed in the data.
Although the empirical model is parsimonious, it does a reasonable job of describing
the diﬀerence in growth patterns before and after liberalization. In 15 out of the 25 cases,
the predicted change in growth is closer than one percentage point to the diﬀerential
observed in the data, and in eight cases it is closer than half of a percentage point. How-
ever, there are six cases for which the model predicts an increase in growth while a decrease
has been observed.17

15 The model is ﬁtted using the estimation of the treatment model based on the de jure index of ﬁnancial
liberalization (see regression [1], Table 1).
16 Interestingly, there are several countries, such as Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Israel, where the predicted
probability of a crisis, and thus the growth cost of crisis, has decreased after ﬁnancial liberalization. This ﬁnding
primarily reﬂects the decrease in the level of inﬂation has decreased in the post-liberalization period.
17 In two cases, Israel and Colombia, the disappointing growth performance can be attributed to political
factors. In the case of Japan, it can be attributed to the long lasting banking crisis of the 90s that is not counted as
a twin crisis.

Our key ﬁnding is that the direct positive eﬀect of ﬁnancial liberalization on growth by
far outweighs its indirect eﬀect through a higher propensity for twin crises. In order to
understand this result, one should keep in mind that even in ﬁnancially liberalized coun-
tries crises remain rare events. Therefore, even if crises can have large output consequences
when they occur, their estimated growth eﬀect remains modest. In contrast, since ﬁnancial

3342

liberalization is likely to improve the access to external ﬁnance, it has a ﬁrst order impact
on growth.

3. Theoretical discussion

What are the theoretical mechanisms that can account for the dual eﬀects of ﬁnancial
liberalization observed in the data? In this section, we discuss three models of the eﬀects of
ﬁnancial liberalization that deliver predictions consistent with the empirical ﬁndings pre-
sented in Section 2.

The interaction between ﬁnancial liberalization policies and capital market imperfec-
tions is at the core of the three models. In Ranciere et al. (2003), ﬁnancial liberaliza-
tion relaxes borrowing constraints and increases growth, but also generates systemic
risk which results in occasional crises. In Martin and Rey (forthcoming), stock market
liberalization and ﬁnancial frictions in asset markets interact to generate either invest-
ment booms or ﬁnancial crashes. In Dell’Ariccia and Marquez (2004a,b) ﬁnancial lib-
eralization leads to less screening by banks, which gives rise to boom-bust credit
cycles.

Ranciere et al. (2003) develop a model where asymmetries between the tradeable (T)
and no-tradeable (N) sectors are key to understanding the link between liberalization
and growth. Because liberalization has not been accompanied by judicial reform, severe
contract enforceability problems have persisted in many developing economies. While
many T-sector ﬁrms can overcome these problems in a liberalized economy by accessing
international capital markets, most N-sector ﬁrms cannot. Thus N-sector ﬁrms are ﬁnan-
cially constrained and depend on domestic bank credit.

Financial liberalization induces higher growth by accelerating ﬁnancial deepening and
thus increasing the investment of ﬁnancially constrained ﬁrms, most of which are in the
N-sector. However, the easing of ﬁnancial constraints is associated with the undertaking
of insolvency risk, which often takes the form of foreign currency denominated debt
backed by N-sector output. Insolvency risk arises because ﬁnancial liberalization not
only lifts restrictions that preclude risk-taking, but is also associated with explicit and
implicit systemic bailout guarantees covering creditors against systemic crises. Not sur-
prisingly, an important share of capital inﬂows takes the form of risky ﬂows to the ﬁnan-
cial sector, and the economy as a whole experiences aggregate fragility and occasional
crises.18

Rapid N-sector growth helps the T-sector grow faster by providing abundant and cheap
inputs. Thus, as long as a crisis does not occur, growth in a risky economy is more rapid
than it is in a safe one. Of course, ﬁnancial fragility implies that a self-fulﬁlling crisis may
occur. And, during a crisis, GDP growth falls and typically turns negative. Crises must be
rare, however, in order to occur in equilibrium – otherwise agents would not ﬁnd it prof-
itable to take on credit risk in the ﬁrst place. Thus, average long-run growth may be faster
along a risky path than along a safe one.

18 For instance, the ratio of foreign liabilities to money in the banking sector, a measure often used to proxy for
currency mismatches, increased in Thailand from 50% in 1990 to 240% in 1996.

Martin and Rey (forthcoming) analyze the impact of stock market liberalization on
capital ﬂows, asset prices and investment. They show that when there are transaction costs
in international assets, stock market liberalization can lead to two possible outcomes for
an emerging market economy. Under normal circumstances, liberalization performs the
positive role of generating capital inﬂows, expanding diversiﬁcation opportunities and
lowering the cost of capital, thus leading to higher investment and growth. However,
under certain circumstances, pessimistic expectations about the state of the economy
can be self-fulﬁlling, leading to a fall in the demand for assets, capital outﬂows and ﬁnan-
cial crashes associated with low investment and low growth. The key element for this
mechanism to operate is that the decision to invest by one agent inﬂuences the cost of
capital of other investors through the impact of that decision on income and the price
of assets.

Dell’Ariccia and Marquez (2004a,b) propose a framework where ﬁnancial liberaliza-
tion leads to rapid lending development driven by a reduction in banks’ screening incen-
tives. In their model, banks’ incentives to screen potential borrowers come from adverse
selection among banks – banks screen to avoid ﬁnancing ﬁrms whose projects have been
tested and rejected by other banks. When ﬁnancial markets are liberalized and many new
and untested projects request funding, banks do not have strong incentives to screen
their pool of applicants and rapid credit expansion ensues. In this case, ﬁnancial liberal-
ization increases investment and growth but also leads to a deterioration in the quality of
the average bank’s portfolio that will result in ﬁnancial fragility. At the macroeconomic
level, as negative shocks occur, ﬁnancial fragility will give way to ﬁnancial crises and out-
put losses.

In the models discussed above ﬁnancial liberalization alleviates the consequences of
capital market imperfections, but does so at the cost of increasing ﬁnancial fragility.
Hence, the overall eﬀect of ﬁnancial liberalization on growth is the result of a risk-return
trade-oﬀ. A ﬁnancially liberalized economy grows faster in normal times, but is exposed
to severe output contractions during ﬁnancial crises. The direct growth eﬀect dominates
under two conditions: First, ﬁnancial
liberalization must strongly reduce ﬁnancial
constraints and help ﬁrms increase investment through higher leverage. Second, the
frequency of ﬁnancial crises must be low enough for risk-taking to pay oﬀ. The regres-
sion analysis presented in Section 2 suggests that these two conditions are consistent with
the data.

4. Conclusions

Several observers have claimed that ﬁnancial liberalization is not good for growth
because of the crises associated with it. This is, however, the wrong lesson to draw. Our
empirical analysis shows that ﬁnancial liberalization leads to faster average long-run
growth, even though it also leads to occasional crises.

We ﬁnd that in a large sample of countries, ﬁnancial liberalization typically leads to
ﬁnancial fragility and occasional ﬁnancial crises. In net terms, however, ﬁnancial liberal-
ization has led to faster long-run growth. Although crises are costly and have severe reces-
sionary eﬀects, they are rare events. Therefore, over the long run, the pro-growth eﬀects of
greater ﬁnancial deepening and more investment by far outweigh the detrimental growth
eﬀects of ﬁnancial fragility and a greater incidence of crises.

Appendix B. Construction of the de facto ﬁnancial liberalization index

It is a de facto index that signals the year when a country has liberalized. We construct
the index by looking for trend-breaks in ﬁnancial ﬂows. We identify trend-breaks by
applying the CUSUM test of Brown et al. (1975) to the time trend of the data. This
method tests for parameter stability based on the cumulative sum of the recursive residu-
als. To determine the date of ﬁnancial liberalization we consider net cumulative capital
inﬂows (KI).19A country is ﬁnancially liberalized (FL) at year t if: (i) KI has a trend break
at or before t and there is at least one year with a KI-to-GDP ratio greater than 5% at or
before t, or (ii) its KI-to-GDP ratio is greater than 10% at or before t. The 5% and 10%
thresholds reduce the possibility of false liberalization and false non-liberalization signals,
respectively.

When the cumulative sum of residuals starts to deviate from zero, it may take a few
years until this deviation is statistically signiﬁcant. In order to account for the delay prob-
lem, we choose the year where the cumulative sum of residuals deviates from zero, pro-
vided that it eventually crosses the 5% signiﬁcance level. The FL index does not allow
for policy reversals: once a country liberalizes it never becomes close thereafter. Since
our sample period is 1980–2000, we consider that our approach is the correct one to ana-
lyse the eﬀects of liberalization on long-run growth and ﬁnancial fragility.20

19 We compute cumulative net capital inﬂows of non-residents since 1980. Capital inﬂows include FDI, portfolio
ﬂows and bank ﬂows. The data series are from the IFS: lines 78BUDZF, 78BGDZF and 78BEDZ. For some
countries not all three series are available for all years. In this case, we use the inﬂows to the banking system only,
which is available for all country-years.
20 If after liberalization a country suﬀers a sharp reversal in capital ﬂows (like in a ﬁnancial crisis), it might
exhibit a second breakpoint. In our sample, however, this possibility is not present: the trend breaks due to crises
are never large enough to show up in signiﬁcant CUSUM test statistics.
