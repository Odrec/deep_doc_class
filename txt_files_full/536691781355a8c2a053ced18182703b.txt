“Europeans and their Languages” 

 
INTRODUCTION 

The  EU  is  committed  to  safeguarding  the  linguistic  diversity  that  exists  within  Europe, 
where  there  are  23  officially  recognised  languages1  and  more  than  60  indigenous 
regional and minority languages, and many non-indigenous languages spoken by migrant 

communities.  It is also committed to promoting knowledge of languages, encouraging all 

citizens  to  be  multilingual,  with  the  long-term  objective  that  every  citizen  has  practical 

skills  in  at  least  two  languages  in  addition  to  his  or  her  mother  tongue.    It  does  so  for 

reasons of cultural identity and social integration and cohesion, and because multilingual 

citizens  are  better  placed  to  take  advantage  of  the  economic,  educational  and 

professional opportunities created by an integrated Europe, with a mobile workforce key 

to the competitiveness of the EU economy. 

A  previous  Eurobarometer  survey  in  2005  highlighted  that  almost  three  fifths  of 

Europeans  (56%)  were  able  to  speak  a  language  other  than  their  mother  tongue, 
although  only  a  minority  (28%)  were  able  to  speak  at  least  two  languages2.    It  also 
showed  that  citizens  generally  supported  the  Commission’s  multilingualism  policies.    A 

new wave of the survey was commissioned to see if and how Europeans’ behaviour and 

opinions  about  multilingualism  have  changed.    As  well  as  spoken  ability,  the  study 

examines  the  level  of  understanding  and  use  of  other  languages,  learning  behaviour, 

attitudes  towards  learning  or  improving  language  skills,  perceptions  of  the  most  useful 

languages,  views  on  EU  policy  in  relation  to  language  use  and  the  role  that  translation 

has.   

This  summary  report  presents  the  most  important  findings  from  this  latest  wave  at  EU 

level  and  highlights  only  the  most  significant  national  and  trend  over  time  variations.  A 

full report, presenting a more thorough analysis of results, is also available. The survey 

was  commissioned  by  the  DG  Education  and  Culture,  DG  for  Translation  and  DG  for 

Interpretation.  It  was  carried  out  by  TNS  Opinion  &  Social  network  with  fieldwork 

conducted  between  25th  February  and  11th  March  2012.  The  methodology  used  is  that 

of Eurobarometer surveys as carried out by the Directorate-General for Communication. 

A  technical  note  on  the  manner  in  which  interviews  were  conducted  by  the  Institutes 

within  the  TNS  Opinion  &  Social  network  is  appended  to  this  report.  It  indicates  the 
interview methods and the confidence intervals3.

“Europeans and their Languages” 

EUROPEANS’ ATTITUDES TOWARDS MULTILINGUALISM 

Around  nine  in  ten  Europeans  (88%)  think  that  languages  other  than  their  mother 
tongue  are  useful  for  personal  development4.    Two  thirds  of  Europeans  (67%)  consider 
English  is  one  of  the  two  most  useful  languages,  and  less  than  one  in  five  mention 

German  (17%),  French  (16%)  and  Spanish  (14%).  Much  smaller  proportions  mention 

Chinese (6%), Italian (5%) and Russian (4%).  There has been a decrease since 2005 in 

the  proportion  of  Europeans  thinking  that  French  and  German  are  important  (-9 

percentage points and -5 points respectively) and an increase in the proportion believing 

that Chinese is an important language (+4 points). 

EU15  is  much  more  likely  than  NMS12  to  consider  Spanish  (20%  vs.  3%  respectively), 

French  (22%  vs.  12%)  and  Chinese  (17%  vs.  3%)  as  important  for  personal 

development, and less likely to rate German (15% vs. 38%) and Russian (3% vs. 9%) as 

important in this respect. 

Almost  every  European  (98%)  thinks  that  foreign  languages  are  useful  for  children  to 
learn for their future5.  Again, English is perceived to be the most useful language in this 
regard, with eight in ten Europeans (79%) thinking this.  One in five mention French and 

German (20% each), slightly smaller proportions Spanish (16%) and Chinese (14%) and 

a  small  minority  Russian  (4%)  and  Italian  (2%).    The  proportion  of  Europeans  thinking 

that French and German are important for children to learn has dropped since 2005 (-13 

percentage points and -8 points respectively), while the proportion perceiving Chinese to 

be important in this respect has increased significantly (+12 points). 

In  all  Member  States  respondents  are  as  likely  or  more  likely  than  in  2005  to  believe 

Chinese is useful for personal development and for children to learn.   The most notable 

increases  in  the  view  that  it  is  useful  for  personal  development  are  in  Spain  (+11 

percentage points) and the UK (+9 points) and, that it is useful for children, in Denmark 

(+25 points), Spain and France (+23 points in each) and Ireland and the UK (+18 points 

in each). 

There is a broad consensus among Europeans that everyone in the EU should be able to 
speak at least one foreign language6.  More than four in five of Europeans (84%) agree, 
and more than two in five (44%) ‘totally agree’ with this view.

“Europeans and their Languages” 

Indeed, more than seven in ten Europeans (72%) agree that people in the EU should be 

able  to  speak  more  than  one  language  in  addition  to  their  mother  tongue,  with  a  third 

(33%) saying that they ‘totally agree’.  Hence Europeans, for the most part, support the 

EU’s vision that EU citizens should be able to speak at least two foreign languages. 

Europeans are  also  widely  in  favour  of people  in  the EU  being  able  to  speak  a  common 

language, with around seven in ten (69%) respondents agreeing with this viewpoint, and 

three in ten (31%) saying that they ‘totally agree’. 

Europeans  are  more  evenly  divided  on  whether  EU  institutions  should  adopt  a  single 

language  to  communicate  with  European  citizens,  although  the  balance  of  opinion  is  in 

favour of this approach.  Just over half of respondents (53%) agree that EU institutions 

should  adopt  a  single  language  to  communicate  with  European  citizens,  with  just  over 

one in five (22%) strongly agreeing with this view.  The balance of opinion on this issue 

is similar to that in 2005. 

 

EU15  is  more  likely  than  NMS12  to  express  strong  support  for  people  speaking  foreign 

languages  and  to  agree  that  everyone  in  the  EU  should  be  able  to  speak  a  common 

language.    Opinions  on  whether  or  not  European  institutions  should  adopt  a  single 

language to communicate with citizens are broadly similar in EU15 and NMS12. 

Overall  agreement  that  the  European  institutions  should  adopt  a  single  language  to 

communicate with European citizens is highest in Slovakia (77%), followed by Spain and 

Cyprus (66%), and lowest in Finland (24%) and Estonia (32%).  

More  than  seven  in  ten  respondents  in  every  Member  State  agree  that  everyone  in  the 

EU should be able to speak at least one language in addition to their mother tongue, with 

respondents  in  the  UK  (72%),  Romania  and  Bulgaria  (73%)  least  likely  and  those  in 

Luxembourg (97%) and Cyprus (96%) most likely to agree.

rather  than  dubbed,  All  languages  spoken  within  the  EU  should  be  treated  equally,  Improving  language  skills

“Europeans and their Languages” 

The majority of respondents in 26 Member States agree that everyone in the EU should 

be  able  to  speak  at  least  two  languages  in  addition  to  their  mother  tongue,  although 

levels of agreement range from 56% in Ireland and Denmark to 91% in Luxembourg and 

94% in Spain.  Finland is the only country where a minority (37%) agree with this view. 

The  view  that  everyone  in  the  EU  should  be  able  to  speak  a  common  language  is  most 

widespread in Italy (82%), Malta (79%), Portugal and Slovakia (77%) and Luxembourg 

(76%), and least widespread in Finland (40%), Latvia (46%) and Estonia (48%).  

Although most Europeans  support the notion that everyone in  the EU should be able to 

speak a common language, this view does not extend to believing that any one language 

should  have  priority.    Eight  in  ten  Europeans  (81%)  agree  that  all  languages  spoken 

within the EU should be treated equally, with nearly half (46%) saying that they ‘totally 

agree’ that this should be the case.  The results suggest that support for the view that all 

languages  within  the  EU  should  be  treated  equally  may  have  strengthened  since  2005, 
when around seven in ten respondents (72%) held this view7.   

More  than  three-quarters  (77%)  of  respondents  think  that  improving  language  skills 

should be a policy priority, with a third (33%) saying that they ‘totally agree’,  reflecting 

the widespread support for multilingualism that other results have demonstrated. 

A  small  majority  of  Europeans  (52%)  prefer  to  watch  foreign  films  and  programmes 

dubbed,  rather  than  with  subtitles.    However,  the  balance  of  opinion  appears  to  have 

shifted  slightly  in  favour  of  subtitles  since  2005,  with  44%  of  respondents  saying  that 

they prefer subtitles in 2012, compared with 37% in 2005. 

National  variation  is  greatest  in  relation  to  preferences  for  watching  foreign  films  and 

programmes,  with  respondents  in  Sweden  (96%),  Finland  (95%),  Denmark  (93%)  and 

the  Netherlands  (93%)  particularly  likely  to  favour  subtitles  and  those  in  the  Czech 

Republic (21%), Germany (22%), Spain (24%) and Slovakia (25%) least likely to do so.   

                                                            
7 The 2012 findings are not directly comparable with those from 2005 because of the move from a two-point to 
a four-point answer scale

“Europeans and their Languages” 

The  view  that  all  languages  spoken  within  the  EU  should  be  treated  equally  is  more 

widespread in  NMS12 (89%)  than in  EU15 (79%).   This view  is held by the majority  of 

respondents  in  all  Member  States.    It  is  most  widespread  in  Greece  (96%),  Cyprus 

(95%),  Latvia  (93%),  Malta  (92%),  the  Czech  Republic  (91%)  and  Poland  (91%),  and 

least so in the Netherlands (56%). 

The majority in every Member State also agree that improving language skills should be 

a policy priority for the EU, with support for this view most widespread in Cyprus (91%), 

Belgium (88%), Hungary (87%), Denmark (86%), Luxembourg (86%) and Spain (85%) 

and least widespread in Latvia (58%). 

The only attitude that shows notable differences in opinion among the socio-demographic 

and behavioural sub-groups is that relating to preference for watching foreign films and 

programmes  with  subtitles,  rather  than  watching  dubbed  versions.    Here  those  groups 

with  a  greater  tendency  to  agree  are  15-24  year  olds;  those  finishing  their  full-time 

education aged 20+; managers; daily internet users and those who position themselves 

high on the social positioning staircase.

“Europeans and their Languages” 

LANGUAGE COMPETENCES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION 

The  majority  of  Europeans  (54%)  are  able  to  hold  a  conversation  in  at  least  one 

additional language other than their mother tongue, a quarter (25%) are able to speak  

at least two additional languages and one in ten (10%) are conversant in at least three8.  
Just under half of all Europeans (46%) are not able to speak any foreign  language well 

enough to hold a conversation. 

There  are  no  signs  that  multilingualism  is  on  the  increase.    The  proportions  have 

decreased  slightly  relative  to  those  reported  in  2005,  although  the  overall  picture 
remains similar.  These small drops may be explained in part by questionnaire changes9, 
and by some significant shifts in the pattern of languages spoken within some individual 

Member States.

and  recorded  from  “Other”  languages  which  may  have  affected  the  way  in  which  regional  languages  were 
recorded.

“Europeans and their Languages” 

Whilst there is little difference in the number of foreign languages spoken between EU15 

and  NMS12  there  is  widespread  national  variation.  In  terms  of  the  long-term  EU 

objective that every citizen has practical skills in at least two foreign languages there are 

only  eight  Member  States  in  which  a  majority  are  able  to  do  this:  Luxembourg  (84%), 

the  Netherlands  (77%),  Slovenia  (67%),  Malta  (59%),  Denmark  (58%),  Latvia  (54%), 

Lithuania (52%) and Estonia (52%).  Those countries where respondents are least likely 

to be able to do so are Portugal and Hungary (13% in each), the UK (14%) and Greece 

(15%). 

There  have  been  some  noticeable  national  shifts  since  2005.    The  proportion  of 

respondents able to speak at least one foreign language has increased most markedly in 

Austria  (+16  percentage  points  to  78%),  Finland  (+6  points  to  75%)  and  Ireland  (+6 

points  to  40%).    It  has  decreased  notably  in  Slovakia  (-17  points  to  80%),  the  Czech 

Republic  (-12  points  to  49%),  Bulgaria  (-11  points  to  48%),  Poland  (-7  points  to  50%) 

and Hungary (-7 points to 35%).  Within these post-Communist countries the proportions 

of  respondents  able  to  speak  foreign  languages  such  as  Russian  and  German  have 
declined  notably  since  200510  -  the  likely  result  of  a  ‘lost’  generation,  with  many  who 
were  able  to  speak  German  (following  the  Second  World  War)  or who  learnt  Russian  at 

school  (it  is  now  much  less  commonly  taught)  now  deceased,  or,  as  time  has  elapsed, 

forgetting how to speak these languages. 

The highest proportion able to speak at least two languages can be found in Luxembourg 

(84%) compared to 13% in Portugal and Hungary. The most noticeable improvement in 

the proportion of respondents able to speak at least two foreign languages is in Italy (+6 

percentage points to 22%) and Ireland (+5 points to 18%).  Ten  Member States show a 

significant drop of more than 5 percentage points: Belgium (-16 points to 50%), Hungary 

(-14 points to 13%), Bulgaria (-12 points to 19%), Poland (-10 points to 22%), Portugal 

(-10  points  to  13%),  Malta  (-9  points  to  59%),  Luxembourg  (-8  points  to  84%), 

Denmark  (-8  points  to  58%),  the  Czech  Republic  (-7  points  to  22%)  and  Estonia  (-6 

points to 52%).   

                                                            
10  For  example,  the  proportion  able  to  speak  Russian  has  dropped  in  Bulgaria  (-12  points),  Slovakia  (-12 
points), Poland (-8 points) and the Czech Republic (-7 points).  Similarly, the proportions speaking German are 
down in the Czech Republic (-13 points), Slovakia (-10 points) and Hungary (-7 points)

full-time  education  aged  20  or  more;  those  holding  management  occupations;  daily 

internet users; those who ‘almost never’ struggle to pay household bills; and those who

“Europeans and their Languages” 

Similar to the picture presented in 2005, the five most widely spoken foreign languages 

are English (38%), French (12%), German (11%), Spanish (7%) and Russian (5%).   

 

 

EU15  is  more  likely  than  NMS12  to  speak  French  (14%  vs.  6%)  and  Spanish  (8%  vs. 

2%) and less likely to speak German (10% vs. 15%) and Russian (2% vs. 16%). 

At  a  national  level  English  is  the  most  widely  spoken  foreign  language  in  all  but  six 

Member  States  where  it  is  not  an  official  language  (i.e.  excluding  the  UK  and  Ireland).  

English and Spanish show notable increases since 2005 in the proportion of respondents 

saying  that  they  know  them  well  enough  to  be  able  to  hold  a  conversation  with  the 

biggest  improvements  for  English  in  Austria  (+15  percentage  points  to  73%),    Finland 

(+7 points to 70%), Latvia (+7 points to 46%) and Lithuania (+6 points to 38%); and, 

for Spanish, in Italy (+7 points to 11%) and Spain (+6 points to 16%). 

There are some notable drops since 2005 in the proportion able to speak French, German 

and  Russian.    For  German  these  are  in  Luxembourg  (-19  points  to  69%),  the  Czech 

Republic  (-13  points  to  15%),  Denmark  (-11  points  to  47%),  Slovakia  (-10  points  to 

22%), Slovenia (-8 points to 42%), Hungary (-7 points to 18%) and Estonia (-7 points to 

15%).  For French the biggest declines are in Luxembourg (-10 points to 80%), Portugal 

(-9 points to 15%), Romania (-7 points to 17%), Bulgaria (-7 points to 2%) and Malta (-

6 points to 11%).  For Russian, the most significant drops are in Bulgaria (-12 points to 

23%),  Slovakia  (-12  points  to  17%),  Estonia  (-10  points  to  56%),  Poland  (-8  points  to 

18%) and the Czech Republic (-7 points to 13%).

“Europeans and their Languages” 

The majority of Europeans who speak English, German, Spanish and Russian as a foreign 
language  believe  they  have  better  than  basic  skills11.    A  quarter  (24%)  of  those  who 
speak Spanish as a foreign language rate their ability as ‘very good’ as do around a fifth 

of  those  who  speak  English  (21%),  German  (19%)  and  Russian  (18%).    Those  who 

speak French as a foreign language are evenly split between those who rate their ability 

as ‘basic’ (49%), and those who believe they have better than basic skills (50%).  Skill 

levels are broadly similar to those seen in 2005.  EU15 is more likely than NMS12 to rate 

their ability at speaking German and Russian as ‘very good’ (23% vs. 10% and 24% vs. 

16% respectively).  

There  has  been  a  marked  increase  since  2005  in  the  proportion  of  respondents  rating 

their skill level in English as ‘very good’ in Malta and Luxembourg (+11 percentage points 

in each to 52% and 33% respectively), Slovenia (+7 points to 28%), Romania (+7 points 
to 22%), Hungary (+7 points to 21%) and Latvia (+7 points to 15%)12. 

 

USAGE OF FOREIGN LANGUAGES 

There  is  a  clear  relationship  between  the  order  in  which  a  language  is  mentioned  (i.e. 

perceived 

fluency)  and 

the 

frequency  with  which 

that 

language 

is  used.  

A  quarter  (24%)  of  respondents  use  their  first  foreign  language  every  day  or  almost 

every day, a similar proportion (23%) use it often and the remainder (50%) use it on an 

occasional basis.  Around one in ten respondents use their second language every day or 

nearly  every  day  (8%),  with  respondents  much  more  likely  to  use  it  on  an  occasional 

basis only (65%). Similarly, only 6% of respondents who speak a third foreign language 

use it on an ‘everyday’ basis, around one in eight (13%) use it often but not daily, and 
around seven in ten (69%) use it occasionally 13.   
English is the language most likely to be used on a more than occasional basis, with just 

under  half  (47%)  of  respondents  who  speak  it  saying  that  they  do,  and  a  fifth  (19%) 

saying  that  they  use  it  every  day  or  almost  every  day.  EU15  tends  to  use  foreign 

languages  more  frequently  than  NMS12,  and,  in  particular,  to  use  them  every  day  or 
almost every day, most notably Spanish (22% vs. 3% respectively). 

                                                            
11  For  each  foreign  language  (up  to  three)  that  a  respondent  said  they  were  able  to  speak  well  enough  to  be

“Europeans and their Languages” 

Foreign  languages  are  most  commonly  used  on  holidays  abroad  (50%),  when  watching 

films/television  or  listening  to  the  radio  (37%),  using  the  internet  (36%)  and 
communicating  with  friends  (35%)14.  Since  2005  there  has  been  a  notable  increase  in 
the  proportion  of  Europeans  who  regularly  use  foreign  languages  on  the  internet  (+10 

percentage points) and when watching films/television/listening to the radio (+8 points). 

EU15  is  more  likely  than  NMS12  to  regularly  use  foreign  languages  for  the  majority  of 

activities. 

 

PASSIVE LANGUAGE SKILLS 

Just over two fifths (44%) of Europeans say that they are able to understand at least one  
foreign  language  well  enough  to  be  able  to  follow  the  news  on  radio  or  television15.  
English  is  the  most  widely  mentioned  foreign  language,  with  a  quarter  (25%)  of 

respondents saying that they can follow radio or television news in English.  Only a small 

minority  of  Europeans say  they understand  French (7%),  German  (7%),  Spanish  (5%), 

Russian (3%) and Italian (2%) well enough to be able to do so. 

A  similar  proportion  (44%)  of  Europeans  are  able  to  read  a  newspaper  or  magazine 

article  in  a  foreign  language.    Again  English  is  the  most  widespread  foreign  language, 

with  a  similar  proportion  of  Europeans  (25%)  able  to  read  a  newspaper  or  magazine 

article  in  the  language  and  correspondingly  smaller  proportions  able  to  do  so  in  French 

(7%), German (6%), Spanish (4%), Russian and Italian (2% each).  

Europeans are slightly less likely to be able to communicate online in a foreign language 

(e.g.  using  email,  Twitter,  Facebook  etc.)  with  two  fifths  (39%)  saying  that  they  can. 

Again, English is the most widely cited language, with a similar proportion of respondents 

(26%) understanding it well enough  to use it in  this way and much  smaller proportions 

able to use French (5%), German (5%), Spanish (3%), Russian and Italian (1% each).

The  demographic  groups  most  likely  to  understand  a  foreign  language  well  enough  to 
undertake these passive activities16 are similar to those most likely to speak at least two 
foreign  languages,  i.e.  those  aged  15-24;  those  finishing  full-time  education  aged  20+; 

daily  internet  users  and  those  who  place  themselves  high  on  the  social  positioning 

staircase.   

WAYS OF LEARNING A LANGUAGE 

The majority of Europeans are not learning languages17.  Just over two fifths (44%) have 
not  learnt  a  language  recently  and  do  not  intend  to  do  so  in  the  next  year;    around  a 

quarter  (23%)  have  never  learnt  a  language  other  than  their  mother  tongue;  and  

around  one  in  seven  (14%)  have  continued  learning  a  language  in  the  last  two  years.  

Less  than  one  in  ten  (7%)  have  started  learning  a  new  language  in  the  last  two  years 

and  a  similar  proportion  have  not  learnt  a  language  recently,  but  intend  to  start  in  the 

coming year (8%). 

These results can be summarised into three categories of language learner.  The majority 
of Europeans (75%) are inactive language learners18; a fifth (20%) are active language 
learners19; and only a very small minority (1%) are very active language learners20.

“Europeans and their Languages” 

EU15  is  more  likely  than  NMS12  to  never  have  learnt  any  language  (26%  vs.  12% 

respectively). 

The most widespread method used by Europeans to learn a foreign language is through 
lessons  at  school21,  mentioned  by  just  over  two  thirds  of  Europeans  (68%).    Other 
learning  methods  are  much  less  widely  adopted.    A  fifth  (19%)  of  Europeans  say  they 

have not used any of the methods for learning a foreign language.

School  lessons  are  the  most  common  way  of  learning  in  every  Member  State,  most 

widespread in  Slovenia and Sweden  (92% in each), Malta and the Netherlands (91% in 

each),  Denmark  and  Latvia  (90%  each)  and  least  widespread  in  Portugal  (33%)  and 

Spain (48%).  Reflecting this, language lessons at school are the method most likely to 

be mentioned, by 46% of Europeans, as the most effective way in which they have learnt 
a foreign language22.   

Respondents  in  Portugal  (55%)  are  most  likely  to  spontaneously  say  that  they  have 

never  used  any  of  the  methods  to  learn  a  foreign  language,  followed  by  those  in  Spain 

(35%), Italy (31%), Greece (28%), Ireland (27%) and Bulgaria (25%).  

Respondents  in  Malta  (69%)  are  particularly  likely  to  say  that  school  lessons  are  the 

most  effective  method  of  learning  a  language  they  have  used,  followed  by  those  in 

Portugal  (54%),  Denmark  (52%)  and  Germany,  Poland  and  the  UK  (51%  in  each).    In 

contrast, respondents in Greece are least likely to perceive language lessons at school as

language lessons with a teacher outside school (51%). 

 

MOTIVATIONS TO LEARNING LANGUAGES 

Three fifths of Europeans (61%) think that a key advantage of learning a new language 
is  that  it  enables  working  in  another  country23.    Just  over  half  (53%)  cite  using  the 
language  at  work  (including  travelling  abroad  on  business)  and  a  slightly  smaller 

proportion using it on holidays abroad (47%).  Over two fifths of respondents think that 

learning  a  new  language  would  help  them  get  a  better  job  in  their  own  country  (45%) 

and study in another country (43%).  Just under two fifths (38%) believe it would help 

with understanding people from other cultures.

Three in ten Europeans (29%) say that free lessons would make them significantly more 

likely  to  learn  or  improve  skills  in  a  language;  and  around  a  fifth  that  they  would  be 

encouraged if they were paid to learn (19%), were able to learn it in the country where it

BARRIERS TO LEARNING 

The  most  widely  mentioned  barrier  to  learning  another  language  is  lack  of  motivation, 
with a third (34%) of respondents saying this discourages them25.  Around a quarter of 
Europeans cite lack of time to study properly (28%) and cost (25%) as barriers; a fifth 

(19%)  not  being  good  at  languages;  and  a  sixth  (16%)  lack  of  opportunity  to  use  the 

language with people who speak it.  The results are similar to those from 2005.

Lack of motivation is most likely to be cited as a barrier in Sweden (52%) and least likely 

to be seen as a barrier in the UK (21%), Portugal (24%) and Estonia (25%).  Not having 

enough  time  to  study  properly  is  most  widely  cited  as  a  reason  for  not  learning 

languages  in  Malta  (43%)  and  Sweden  (40%)  and  least  widely  mentioned  in  Portugal 

(15%).  Cost is most  likely to be seen  as a deterrent  in  Bulgaria (46%),  Greece (45%) 

and  Hungary  (44%),  with  respondents  in  Finland  (6%)  least  likely  to  cite  this  as  a 

reason.    Lack  of  ability  at  languages  is  most  likely  to  be  mentioned  as  a  barrier  in  the 

Czech Republic (33%) and least likely to be discouraging those in Cyprus (8%). 

 

ATTITUDES TO TRANSLATION 

In seven of eight areas that respondents were asked to think about, a majority think that 
translation  has  an  important  role  to  play26.    The  exception  is  in  people’s  everyday  lives 
where just over two in five Europeans (43%) say that translation has an important role 

to play, and just under one in six (16%) consider this role to be very important.  Three in 

ten Europeans (30%) say that translation plays no role at all in their everyday lives. 

Europeans are  most  likely  to  perceive  translation  as  playing  an  important  role  in  health 

and  safety  (71%)  and  in  education  and  learning  (76%).    Around  two  thirds  of 

respondents  (68%)  think  that  translation  plays  an  important  role  in  job  seeking  and  a 

similar proportion (67%) that it plays an important role in relation to getting news about 

events in the rest of the world.  Slightly fewer respondents - around six in ten - view the 

role of translation as important in relation to getting information about or participation in 

EU  activities  (60%),  accessing  public  services  (59%),  and  leisure  activities  such  as  TV, 

films and reading (57%).

“Europeans and their Languages” 

Respondents in EU15 and NMS12 have similar perceptions of the importance of the role 

of  translation  in  their  daily  lives  and  in  leisure  activities,  such  as  television,  films  and 

reading.  In relation to the other activities, respondents in EU15 are slightly more likely 

than those in NMS12 to think that translation plays an important role, as follows:  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In  relation  to  getting  news  on  events  in  the  rest  of  the  world  (68%  in  EU15  vs. 

62% in NMS12) 

in health and safety (72% vs. 67% respectively) 

in accessing public services (62% vs. 55%) 

in education and learning (78% vs. 69%) 

in looking for a job 69% vs. 63%) 

in obtaining information about or participation in EU activities (61% vs. 55%) 

Opinions  on  the  importance  of  translation  in  relation  to  each  of  the  activities  vary 

considerably  by  country,  although  to  a  broadly  consistent  pattern.    Respondents  in 

Cyprus, Luxembourg, Sweden, Denmark and Finland express consistently positive views 

about the role that translation has to play across all of the activities, with large majorities 

of  respondents  in  each  of  these  countries  perceiving  the  role  of  translation  to  be 

important across the range of areas. 

In  contrast,  respondents  in  Ireland  are  the  least  likely  to  perceive  translation  as 

important  in  all  eight  of  the  areas,  and  are  considerably  less  likely  than  those  in  any 

other  country  to  do  so.    The  proportion  of  respondents  in  Ireland  who  consider 

translation to be important in the different areas ranges from 15% in relation to leisure 

activities to 21% in relation to education and learning.  Respondents in Bulgaria also tend 

to have consistently less positive views on the importance of translation than most other 

countries.

“Europeans and their Languages” 

However,  the  proportions  of  respondents  in  Bulgaria  who  consider  translation  to  be 

important  in  the  different  areas  is  still  significantly  higher  than  in  Ireland,  ranging  from 

28% in relation to everyday life and accessing public services to 41% in relation to health 

and safety.  Apart from Ireland and Bulgaria, respondents in Austria emerge as tending 

to have less positive perceptions of the importance of translation than those elsewhere in 

the EU. 

The one area in which the pattern of results by country departs somewhat from the norm 

is  in  relation  to  the  role  that  translation  plays  in  looking  for  a  job,  where  the  highest 

levels of agreement are found in Greece (83%), Italy (83%) and France (82%), perhaps 

reflecting the economic backdrop against which the survey was conducted.    

Broadly speaking, socio-demographic differences in opinions about the role of translation 

reflect  those  found  elsewhere,  with  more  positive  views  tending  to  be  expressed  by 

younger  people  (those  aged  15-24),  those  who  finished  their  full-time  education  aged 

20+ and regular internet users.
