Summary. — The rural economy of Lesotho is characterized by dependence on circular labor
migration to South African mines and declining agricultural output per capita. This paper attempts
to improve the understanding of the relationship between circular labor migration and agricultural
production by comparing the technical e(cid:129)ciency of farms that supply migrant laborers with that of
farms that do not. Through analysis of the relative technical e(cid:129)ciency of these two farm categories
conclusions are drawn concerning the likely impact of changing migration patterns on the
agricultural sector. (cid:211) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

1. INTRODUCTION

It would be di(cid:129)cult

to exaggerate the
signiﬁcance of labor migration in Lesotho(cid:213)s
economy. Over a quarter of the male labor
force of Lesotho is engaged in mine employ-
ment in South Africa. These workers are typi-
cally on ﬁxed-term contracts
spanning 12
months which require them to return to Leso-
tho before a renewal. The migrants’ remittances
make up over 80% of factor income from
abroad which constituted 40% to 50% of
Lesotho’s gross national product during 1983–
91 with a marginal decline in subsequent years
(Bureau of Statistics, 1992; Cobbe, 1995). At
the household level, remittances from migrant
laborers in South Africa are the main source of
income for about 35% of homesteads and 70%
of households have had at least one member as
a migrant worker. Similar oscillatory labor
migration has been signiﬁcant in the economies
of Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland
and Zimbabwe.

Recent social, political and economic transi-
tions in South Africa have made the future of
circular labor ﬂows uncertain and raised ques-
tions about
reduced

impact of

the social

remittance ﬂows in the region (Leliveld, 1997;
Crush & James, 1995; Gustafsson & Makon-
nen, 1993). By 1997, South African mine
employment had fallen by one-third from its
level
in the mid-1980s and the number of
miners from Lesotho had fallen to its lowest
level since the early 1970s. Further retrench-
ments in mining employment appear likely. The
implications of
for
employment in South Africa and the policy
response to this threat depend on the relation-
ship between oscillatory labor migration and
Lesotho(cid:213)s agricultural sector. If labor migration

sector,
economic losses through reduced opportunities
for employment in South Africa may be partly
