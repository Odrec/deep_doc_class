a
frameworks on global value chains (GVC) and what
we term GPN 1.0 tend to under-theorize the origins
and dynamics of these organizational platforms and
to overemphasize their governance typologies (e.g.,
modular, relational, and captive modes in GVC
theory) or analytical categories (e.g., power and
embeddedness in GPN 1.0). Building on this expand-
ing literature, our article aims to contribute toward
the reframing of existing GPN-GVC debates and the
development of a more dynamic theory of global
production networks that can better explain the emer-
gence of different ﬁrm-speciﬁc activities, strategic
network effects, and territorial outcomes in the
global economy. It is part of a wider initiative—GPN
2.0 in short—that seeks to offer novel theoretical
insights into why and how the organization and coor-
dination of global production networks varies sig-
niﬁcantly within and across different
industries,
sectors, and economies. Taking an actor-centered
focus toward theory development, we tackle a sig-
niﬁcant gap in existing work by systematically con-
ceptualizing the causal drivers of global production
networks in terms of their competitive dynamics
(optimizing cost-capability ratios, market impera-
tives, and ﬁnancial discipline) and risk environments.
These capitalist dynamics are theorized as critical
independent variables that shape the four main strat-
egies adopted by economic actors in (re)conﬁguring
their global production networks and, ultimately, the
developmental outcomes in different
industries,
regions, and countries.

Since the early 1990s, global production has
become much more organizationally fragmented and
spatially dispersed, a process often associated with
the economic globalization so eloquently analyzed in
Dicken’s (2011) Global Shift. Arguably, however,
most commentators in the social sciences, including
economic geographers, remain unable to provide a
comprehensive and dynamic theory explaining how
these globalization processes are actually organized.
In its World Investment Report 2013,
the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD 2013) estimated that some 80 percent of
international trade was now organized through global
production networks coordinated by lead ﬁrms invest-
ing in cross-border productive assets and trading
inputs and outputs with partners, suppliers, and cus-
tomers worldwide. Empirically, there is now no doubt
that global production networks (GPN)1 and global
value chains (GVC) are the most critical organiza-
tional platforms
through which production in
primary, manufacturing, and service sectors is coor-
dinated and organized on a global basis. A 2010
World Bank report on the post-2008 world economy
further claimed that “given that production processes
in many industries have been fragmented and moved
around on a global scale, GVCs have become the
world economy’s backbone and central nervous
system” (Cattaneo Gerefﬁ, and Staritz 2010, 7). As
noted in Gerefﬁ (2014), these cross-border produc-
tion networks and value chains have recently received
very signiﬁcant empirical and policy attention in
major international organizations, with a range of
widely circulated reports produced between 2010 and
2013 (Cattaneo et al. 2010; Elms and Low 2013;
OECD-WTO-UNCTAD 2013; UNCTAD 2013). To
analysts in many such international organizations,
global value chains and global production networks
now constitute the long-term structural architecture
of the global economy.

These rapid and profound developments within the
global economy over the past two decades have posed
signiﬁcant challenges to theorization. For us, the most
productive lines of enquiry within the critical social
sciences during that time have shifted the analytical
focus from trade in ﬁnished goods between national

1 In this article, we use the acronym “GPN” to denote theory or
literature, and “global production networks” to refer to the
empirical phenomenon. The same distinction applies to “GVC”
and “global value chains.”
