Interior Space Perception: Effects of Furniture, 

Color, and Lighting

Wednesday, 14 January 2015, 5 pm (sharp) 32/110

Abstract

 
Virtual  interior  spaces  have  become  part  of  our  everyday 
lives. We become immersed in them in the movie theater or 
when we pull out our smart-phones and delve into an app. 
However,  surprisingly  little  is  known  about  the  factors  that 
determine  the  perception  of  interior  space,  and  whether 
real  and  virtual  interior  spaces  follow  similar  laws.  We 
report  a  series  of  experiments  investigating  the  role  of 
lighting  and  furniture  on  perceived  spatial  dimensions  and 
roominess of virtual and genuine rooms. Movie stills, virtual 
rooms,  and  a  room  with  a  hoisting  platform  served  as 
stimuli.

§  ANOVA 

§  Concepts 
§  Basic approach 
§  Post-hoc tests 
§  Text blocks 

§  R/Rcommander 

§  Run R 
§  Install and run Rcommander 
§  Read in data 

Previous Assignment 

§  Reading: Howitt & Cramer (2011), pp. 55-74 

§  Write a short summary of key concepts (also include in portfolio) à 

bullet points 

§  Analysis: Prepare data file with raw data. Ideally, one file with all 

relevant variables à trial level (as “raw” as possible). 

§  Figure: Create “ideal” figure for main result of your experiment. 
§  Git: Create folder for Data Analysis. Include the raw data file and commit 

stage. Document your commit message in the PDF. 
§  Tutorial: https://www.codeschool.com/paths/git (e.g., TryGit) 

Miscellaneous 

§  Poster 

§  Template on Stud.IP (maybe use landscape) 

§  .png file à with pictures 
§  .svg file à Inkscape (without pictures) 

§  Start working on text parts and figures (Inkscape and 

Gimp)

Statistics/Analysis 

ANOVA – Factors and Levels 

§  Dependent Variable: feature of interest that is 
measured and considered for analysis à output 
e.g., reaction times, questionnaire data 

§  Factors/Independent Variables: feature of 
interest that is manipulated to influence the 
dependent variable à input 
e.g., set size, target 

§  Factor Levels: specific value on the factor 

dimension à set size (1, 2, 4) 

§  Multifactorial Designs: more than one factor 
can be combined in a single design (one-way 
ANOVA, two-way ANOVA, xxx-way ANOVA) 

SPSS – ANOVA Results 

Sternberg - main effects “Set” and “Probe” 

ANOVA – Main Effects and Interactions 

§  Main Effects: Mean differences between levels 

of a factor (ignoring the other factors) 
à Not all level means are from same population 

§  Interactions: Level of Factor A has an impact 

on effect of Factor B 
à The main effects don’t just add up 

§  Post-hoc Tests: Testing differences between 

different level combinations (cells) 
à What drives the main and interaction effects

Results Attentional Blink 

We computed a two-way repeated-
measures ANOVA on the percent 
correct responses with the factors 
‘distance’ (separation between first and 
second target) and ‘target’ (first vs. 
second target letter). There was a main 
effect of ‘distance’ (F(3,51) = 23.60, p < 
0.001), but no effect for ‘target’ (F(1,17) 
= 0.94, p = 0.35). The interaction 
between ‘distance’ and ‘target’ was 
also significant (F(3,51) = 30.53, p < 
0.001). 

Results Post-Hoc Tests 

Comparing percent correct for first and second target separately for the 
different target separations, we found that accuracy for the first target was 
higher with the two smaller distance separations (distance ‘2’: t(17) = 
4.48, p < 0.001; distance ‘4’: t(17) = 2.84, p = 0.01), but lower for the two 
larger distance separations (distance ‘6’: t(17) = -4.11, p = 0.001; distance 
‘8’: t(17) = -4.36, p < 0.001).
