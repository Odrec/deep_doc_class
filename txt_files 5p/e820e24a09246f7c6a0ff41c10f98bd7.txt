Introducing Gary Klein

● born in 5.2.1944

● BA in Psychology in 1964 in New York

● PhD in Experimental Psychology in 1969 in Pittsburgh

● research psychologist for the U.S. Air Force

● founded R&D company

● famous for his Recognition Primed Decision Model (1985)

➔ this changed the ways the Army and Marines train their 

officers to make decisions

Naturalistic Decision Making

● Critic: Former psychologic studies based on 

experiments with well-structured settings which were 

highly controlled by the researches

➔ How do people make decisions in real world scenarios?

● field research

● difficult conditions (limited time, uncertainty, high 

stakes, vague goals, unstable conditions)

Critical Decision Method

● retrospective interview strategy

● relies on one non-routine incident

● applies set of cognitive probes

● specific procedures for analysing data

Critical Decision Method

Focus On Non-Routine Cases :

● higher source of data about capabilities of highly 

skilled personnel

● allows aspects of expertise to emerge

Critical Decision Method

Cognitive Probes:

● not limited to objective responses

● decision maker has to reflect on own strategies and 

bases for decisions

Critical Decision Method

Semi Structured Probing:

● balance between unstructured and too structured 

approach

● avoid problems of these two 

Critical Decision Method

Step 1: Select Incident

● search for non routine incidents

● probes may go beyond general knowledge

● avoid cases in which death or unusual episode made 

incident a memorable one

Critical Decision Method

Step 2: Obtain Unstructured Incident Account

● create a context for interviewer’s understanding

● activate the participant’s memory of the event as a 

context for questioning

 

Critical Decision Method

Step 3: Construct Incident Timeline

● interview reconstruct as a timeline

● serves to establish a shared awareness of the facts of 

the case

● inconsistencies can be detected and corrected and 

missing facts filled in 

Critical Decision Method

Step 4: Decision Point Identification

● specific decisions are identified

● probe if the participant would agree that other 

reasonable courses of action were possible or that 

another person might have chosen differently

Critical Decision Method

Step 5: Decision Point Probing

● probe prior knowledge

● interest in eliciting any recall of prior experiences that 

influenced the participants expectancies

● elicit specific goals

● probes about options 

Critical Decision Method

Recognition-Primed Decision Model

● ability to handle decisions depend on their skill at 

recognizing situations as typical and familiar

● only one option at time is evaluated

○ feasible goals are chosen
○ decisionmaker is sensitized to important cues
○ understanding of causal dynamics is provided
○ promising course of action is suggested
○ expectancies are created

Recognition-Primed Decision Model 

Application Areas

Training of:

● Army

● Navy

● Airforce

● Firefighters

● Medical personnel

● Computer programmers
