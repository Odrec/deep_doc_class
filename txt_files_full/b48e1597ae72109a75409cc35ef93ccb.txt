Background

study of genetic interactions
1)  functional assignment of genes
2)  system-level organization

1. approach: effect of deletions in a double mutant 

But: unable to observe essential genes (non-viable mutants)
2. approach: SPA (Sequential Peptide Affinity) tag

But: mechanism of destabilization not clearly understood 
        and often causes no measurable effect in a single mutant
Solution: creation of a conditionally inducible knock down of an
essential gene combined with a chromosomal knock 
out of a nonessential

   

 

 

Genetic Interaction (GI)

combination of two genes 
results in a different phenotype 
than the expression of either 
gene alone
→ epistasis
positive GI
→ synergistic effect
negative GI
→diminished effect

gen 1
gen 2

→
→

phenotype 1
phenotype 2

genetic interaction
gen 1 + gen 2 → phenotype 3

no genetic interaction
gen 1 + gen 2 → phenotype 1 & 2

→often in compensatory pathways
→ essential genes tend to have more GI than nonessential genes 
and the functions of these interacting genes are more likely to be 
diverse than for  those of nonessential genes
 

 

Principle Mechanism

high-throughput screen 
based on GIANT-Coli 
and eSGA
subsequent conjugation 
1. essential gene controlled by a 

lac-operon

2. Hfr-deletion of the 

chromosomal gene + IPTG 
induced expression

observed phenotype: 
→growth rate 

Protein concentration dependence a the growth rate

 

 

Doubling time of chromosomal knockout mutants as a 
function of IPTG concentration.

creation of the double mutant strain (Yong et al. 2013)

 

SKOp= single knock out plasmid   
             containing

DKO= double knock out

Conclusion

1)combination of Hfr-based chromosomal KO with a 
conditional KD of the essential gene by a F-plasmid
→ new insights into possible unknown genetic interactions due to the 

observation of GI of essential genes

2)high throughput screen

→ fast, systematical and reproducible screening of query genes

3)better understanding of the observed GI due to the 

known mechanism of the mutational effect 
→ growth deficiency caused by a KD of the essential protein 

 

 

pFE604T

→ low copy, F-based complementing plasmid

Computational processing

→ growth determined by scanning and 

 
 computing pixels for density of the colonies

 

→ normalization
→ Plate edge effect
→ Plate- by plate variation in average density
→ Nonessential gene deletion and presence of the plasmid

→ values deviating from normal distribution   

 
 parameters were designated either positive   
 or negative interactions

→ exclusion of genes within 35 kB of the query 

 essential gene, because of linkage effects

Pilot study of 5 essential genes

→ dnaN: beta subunit of 

DNA polymerase III 
→ ftsW: involved in cell 

division

→ trmD: required for 
tRNA methylation

 

→ yjgP: LPS transporter 
→ yrfF: unknown function 
→ each screen resulted 

in an average of 77 
interactions

 

 

 
 

List of genetic interactions filtered after counting for linkage effect (35kbp-
window) and common interactions. Yellow box indicates negative GI score and 
blue box indicates positive GI score. Yong et al., 2013

Results of the 

pilot study

→ some interactions 

 may be due to 
 secondary effects 
 caused by low 
 levels of essential 
 protein

→ e.g. low levels of 
 dnaN may cause 
 double strand 
 breaks

Summary

→ essential genes show more interactions than 

 nonessential genes (77:20)

→ no overlap between the study of GI done by   

SPA-tagging and DKO

→ high throughput analysis only generates hints
→ secondary effects by low levels of essential 

 genes

→ GI here = effect on cell growth
→ results have to be verified with other methods
