Cognition has a severely limited capacity: Adult humans can retain
only about four items “in mind”. This limitation is fundamental to
human brain function: Individual capacity is highly correlated with
intelligence measures and capacity is reduced in neuropsychiatric
diseases. Although human capacity limitations are well studied,
their mechanisms have not been investigated at the single-neuron
level. Simultaneous recordings from monkey parietal and frontal
cortex revealed that visual capacity limitations occurred immedi-
ately upon stimulus encoding and in a bottom-up manner. Capacity
limitations were found to reﬂect a dual model of working memory.
The left and right halves of visual space had independent capacities
and thus are discrete resources. However, within each hemiﬁeld,
neural information about successfully remembered objects was re-
duced by adding further objects, indicating that resources are shared.
Together, these results suggest visual capacity limitation is due to
discrete, slot-like, resources, each containing limited pools of neural
information that can be divided among objects.

Despite the remarkable power and ﬂexibility of human cog-

nition, our working memory—the “online” workspace that
most cognitive mechanisms depend upon—is surprisingly lim-
ited. An average adult human has a capacity to retain only four
items at a given time (1–3). This capacity is fundamental to
cognition: Individual variability in capacity is highly correlated
with ﬂuid intelligence (4–6) and patients with neuropsychiatric
disorders often have a reduced capacity (7, 8). Because it is so
basic to cognition, capacity limitation has been well studied in
humans (9), particularly the capacity limitation of visual short-
term working memory (for reviews see refs. 1 and 4). This work
has led to several competing theories about the neural basis of
capacity limitations. “Discrete” models suggest that capacity limi-
tations reﬂect a limit in the number of objects that can be simul-
taneously represented (3, 10, 11). “Flexible resource” models
predict that only the total amount of information available is
limited, with information divided among all represented objects
(12–14). It is also not clear whether the limitation is in stimulus
encoding or in maintenance (15).

To better understand the neural basis of capacity limitations
we simultaneously recorded from single neurons in the pre-
frontal and parietal cortex of two monkeys trained to perform
a typical human test of cognitive capacity: change localization
(Fig. 1A). Two arrays of objects (colored squares) were sepa-
rated by a short memory delay. In the second array, the color of
a randomly chosen object (the target) was changed. Monkeys
were trained to detect this change and make a saccade to it.
Cognitive load was increased by varying the number of objects in
the arrays from two to ﬁve. We recorded simultaneously from
multiple electrodes in the frontal cortex [lateral prefrontal cortex
(LPFC) and frontal eye ﬁelds (FEF)] and the parietal cortex
[lateral intraparietal area (LIP)]. These areas were chosen as
they are critical for short-term memory (16–19) and human
studies implicate them in capacity limitations (20–22).

Results
Like in humans, increasing the number of objects decreased per-
formance (84.8% correct with 2 objects to 66.5% with 5 objects,
Fig. 1B). The amount of information the monkeys had about

the objects in the array, calculated from their behavior (SI Mate-
rials and Methods), increased from 2 to 4 objects, but then satu-
rated, reﬂecting a limited capacity (Fig. 1C; 2 < 3, P < 10−15; 3 < 4,
P < 10−15; 4 < 5, P = 0.12, two-tailed permutation test). A capacity-
limited model ﬁtted the animals’ information signiﬁcantly better
than a simpler linear model (P = 0.026, validation test, see SI
Materials and Methods for details). Both monkeys’ capacities were
similar (3.88 monkey Sp, 3.87 monkey Si), with an overall average
of 3.88 objects [95% conﬁdence interval (CI): 3.82–3.93; SI
Materials and Methods]. In similar paradigms the capacity of an
average adult human is typically around 4 items (1).

Closer examination of the monkeys’ behavior revealed that
their total capacity was composed of two independent, smaller,
capacities in the right and left halves of visual space (hemiﬁelds).
Adding objects to the same hemiﬁeld as the target strongly de-
graded performance (Fig. 2A, rows), whereas adding objects in the
opposite hemiﬁeld had no impact (Fig. 2A, columns; ipsilateral
effect, P = 5.0 × 10−11; contralateral effect, P = 0.23; ANOVA).
The number of same-hemiﬁeld objects accounted for >95% of the
behavioral effect of the total number of objects. Behavioral per-
formance was not signiﬁcantly different between the two hemi-
ﬁelds, suggesting similar capacity in each hemisphere (target
hemiﬁeld effect, P = 0.74; ANOVA). The information the animals
had about each hemiﬁeld increased with a second object, but then
saturated, suggesting each hemiﬁeld’s capacity was ∼2 objects
(Fig. 2C; 2 > 1, P < 10−15; 3 > 2, P = 0.58, two-tailed permutation
test). Again, a nonlinear, capacity-limited model ﬁt signiﬁcantly
better than a linear one (P = 4.4 × 10−4, validation test). The es-
timated per-hemiﬁeld capacity was 1.6 objects (95% CI: 1.60–1.64;
capacity of 1.74 for Sp and 1.51 for Si, Fig. S1).

Neural activity also showed independent capacities for each
visual hemiﬁeld. For example, average object information in
LPFC neurons during the sample period decreased with increasing
number of objects in the same hemiﬁeld (Fig. 2D, Left), but not
the opposite hemiﬁeld (Fig. 2D, Right; ipsilateral effect, P = 1.4 ×
10−4; contralateral effect, P = 0.51; two-way ANOVA). We found
the same effect during the memory delay [ipsilateral effect (Ipsi),
P = 2.6 × 10−6; contralateral effect (Contra), P = 0.53; two-way
ANOVA] as well as in the LIP and FEF (Ipsi, P = 0.026 and P =
0.029; Contra, P = 0.52 and P = 0.19; two-way ANOVA; see SI
Materials and Methods for details). This result cannot reﬂect
attention to one hemiﬁeld or switching attention between them;
the monkeys could not predict which object would change and
performance was well above that expected from those strategies.
Is the brain’s capacity limit a bottom–up failure to perceptu-
ally encode objects or a top–down failure to retain objects in
memory? A perceptual encoding failure predicts that, when ca-
pacity is exceeded, object information is lost during neurons’
sensory responses and in lower-order before higher-order cortex.

Fig. 1.
(A) Task timeline. Animals ﬁxated (indicated by red circle) to start
trial. A sample array was presented for 800 ms, consisting of two to ﬁve
objects (ranging from zero to three in each hemiﬁeld). After a brief memory
delay (800–1,000 ms) a test array was displayed that was identical to the
sample, except one object (the target) had changed color. (B) Behavioral
performance decreased as the number of objects in the stimulus array was
increased. (C) The information the animal had about the entire stimulus
array (derived from behavioral performance) increased until four or more
objects were in the array, indicating the animal’s capacity was between
three and four objects. All error bars indicate 95% conﬁdence intervals.

A memory failure predicts a loss later (after encoding) and in
higher cortical areas ﬁrst. We found the former. Below capacity
(one object per hemiﬁeld), object information appeared in LIP
early after sample array onset [193 ms (95% conﬁdence interval,
149–229 ms); Fig. 3A], followed by LPFC [317 ms (249–359 ms);
Fig. 3B] and FEF [291 ms (249–339 ms); Fig. 3C, LIP < the
LPFC, P < 10−3; LIP < FEF, P = 0.003, randomization test],
consistent with a bottom–up ﬂow of sensory information from
parietal to frontal cortex. By comparing below- to above-capacity
activity, we computed the latency for information loss (Fig. 3,
compare blue curve to red/green curves). Information loss began
soon after array onset and immediately in LIP activity [191 ms
(139–249 ms); Fig. 3A, black square], earlier than in the LPFC
[341 ms (289–379 ms); Fig. 3B, black square] and FEF [658 ms
(599–709 ms); Fig. 3C, black square, LIP < LPFC, P < 10−3; LIP <
FEF, P < 10−3; LPFC < FEF, P < 10−3, randomization test]. In
fact, when capacity was exceeded (two to three objects per
hemiﬁeld), information in the LIP was weak and did not reach
signiﬁcance until after the LPFC and FEF (all P < 10−3, Fig. 3
A–C and SI Materials and Methods). Individual neurons showed
similar effects, with >85% of neurons selective in both below-
and above-capacity displays showing a decrease in information
when displays were above capacity (P = 4 × 10−8 across all areas;
Fig. S3 and SI Materials and Methods). Information loss above
capacity carried through the memory delay (Fig. 3 A–C, Right)
with the LPFC showing a further reduction of information for
three vs. two objects late in the delay (P = 0.047, randomization
test). One possibility is that this delayed difference between two-
and three-item displays reﬂects an unbounded (or less limited)
source of information available during sample presentation but
lost during the memory delay (e.g., iconic memory, ref. 2).

A limited capacity to represent multiple objects was evident on
a behavioral and neural
level. However, what is the neural
mechanism underlying this bottleneck? Two main hypotheses
have been put forth. First, objects could compete for encoding
within a limited number of discrete “slots”, with each object
being either successfully or unsuccessfully encoded (3, 10, 11).

Fig. 2.
(A) Behavioral performance (indicated by the color of the border/
background) for all possible stimulus displays. Adding objects to the same
side (ipsilateral) as the target (marked with a “T”) impaired performance
(rows), whereas adding objects to the other side (contralateral) had no ef-
fect. This result argues for separate capacities in each hemisphere. (B) Be-
havioral performance decreased as the number of objects ipsilateral to the
target was increased and (C) the information the animal had about the ip-
silateral stimulus array (derived from behavioral performance) increased
until two or more objects, reﬂecting the animal’s capacity was between one
and two objects in each hemiﬁeld. (D) Information was lost in lateral pre-
frontal cortex (LPFC) neurons over the sample period (100–800 ms after
stimulus array onset) as items were added ipsilateral to the encoded object
(Left). However, adding contralateral items (Right) had no impact on neural
information, matching the observed behavioral effects. All error bars in-
dicate 95% conﬁdence intervals.

Alternatively, capacity limitations could reﬂect a limited in-
formation “pool” that is ﬂexibly divided among objects, and so
adding objects reduces the information allotted to each encoded
object (12–14). Our behavioral and neural data suggest that the
two hemiﬁelds act like two slots. We tested whether encoding
was also slot-like within a hemiﬁeld.

A pure slot-like model predicts that encoding an object is all
or none: If successfully remembered, there should be an equal
amount of information about it regardless of how many other
objects are in the array. If an object is forgotten, there should be
no information about it. In contrast, we found that even when
a given target object was successfully encoded and retained, in-
formation about that speciﬁc object was reduced in all three
areas when another object was added to its hemiﬁeld (Fig. 4A,
1 > 2 objects: LIP, P = 0.033, 150–350 ms after array onset;
LPFC, P = 0.001, at 350–800 ms; FEF, P = 0.041 at 450–800 ms,
