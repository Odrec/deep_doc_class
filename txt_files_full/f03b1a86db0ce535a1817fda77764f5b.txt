Vacuolar-type ATPase (V-ATPase) purified from the
midgut of the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta is in-
hibited 50% by 10 nM of the plecomacrolide concanamy-
cin A, the specific inhibitor of V-ATPases. To determine
the binding site(s) of that antibiotic in the enzyme com-
plex, labeling with the semisynthetic 9-O-[p-(trifluoro-
ethyldiazirinyl)-benzoyl]-21,23-dideoxy-23-[125I]iodo-
concanolide A (J-concanolide A) was performed, which
still inhibits the V-ATPase 50% at a concentration of
15–20 ␮M. Upon treatment with UV light, a highly reac-
tive carbene is generated from this concanamycin deriv-
ative, resulting in the formation of a covalent bond to
the enzyme. In addition, the radioactive tracer 125I
makes the detection of the labeled subunit(s) feasible.
Treatment of the V1/Vo holoenzyme, the Vo complex, and
the V-ATPase containing goblet cell apical membranes
with concanolide resulted in the labeling of only the
proteolipid, subunit c, of the proton translocating Vo
complex. Binding of J-concanolide A to subunit c was
prevented in a concentration-dependent manner by con-
canamycin A, indicating that labeling was specific.
Binding was also prevented by the plecomacrolides
bafilomycin A1 and B1, respectively, but not by the ben-
zolactone enamide salicylihalamide, a member of a
novel class of V-ATPase inhibitors.

Vacuolar-type ATPases (V-ATPases)1 are complex, hetero-
multimeric proteins consisting of a peripheral, catalytic V1
complex and a membrane bound, ion translocating Vo complex.

V-ATPases in eukaryotes appear to be exclusive proton pumps
that energize intracellular membranes of all cells as well as
plasma membranes in a variety of animal cells (1). V-ATPases
play crucial roles for many cellular processes and may also be
involved in diseases such as osteoporosis and cancer (2).

More than a decade ago, bafilomycin A1, a plecomacrolide
antibiotic containing a 16-membered lactone ring, was reported
to be a specific inhibitor of V-ATPases with a Ki value of less
than 10 nM (3). A structure-activity study showed that the
concanamycins, 18-membered plecomacrolides, exhibit 10-fold
lower Ki values and thus are better and more specific inhibitors
of V-ATPases than the bafilomycins (4). Kinetic studies of the
bovine chromaffin granule V-ATPase provided the first indirect
evidence that bafilomycin A1 interacts with the hydrophobic Vo
complex (5). Direct evidence came from two independent ap-
proaches, both using the bovine-coated vesicle V-ATPase (6, 7).
First, a latent acid-activated proton conductance of proteolipo-
somes containing the reconstituted Vo complex could be blocked
by 1 nM bafilomycin A1 (6). Second, reconstituted vesicles con-
taining the Vo complex added to clathrin-coated vesicles could
protect ATP-dependent proton transport from bafilomycin in-
hibition (7). Since considerable protection was also achieved by
the reconstituted 100-kDa subunit a alone, it was concluded
that the binding site for bafilomycin may reside in this subunit.
Affinity chromatography of chicken osteoclast V-ATPase us-
ing bafilomycin C1-coupled cellulose led to the purification of
the holoenzyme (8). In the presence of 1 mM DCCD the
V-ATPase did not bind to the column, indicating that the bind-
ing site for bafilomycin is near the binding site(s) for DCCD and
may thus be located in the proteolipid, subunit c. However,
because DCCD, especially at the rather high concentration of 1
mM, may bind to sites different from that in the proteolipid and
may bind not only to carboxyl groups but also to sulfhydryl
groups or to tyrosine residues (9), and since the 100-kDa sub-
unit a was not clearly resolved in this study, the bafilomycin
binding subunit was still not identified. Strong hints in favor of
subunit c representing the bafilomycin binding subunit were
provided by recent results from analysis of Neurospora crassa
strains, indicating that those with point mutations in subunit c
show a higher tolerance to bafilomycin (I50 80–400 nM) com-
pared with the wild type (I50 6.3 nM); interestingly, the toler-
ance to concanamycin was not changed simultaneously (10).

Based on extensive screening studies of systematically mod-
ified derivatives of concanamycin, a probe was designed that
still inhibits V-ATPase activity and which generates upon
UV-irradiation a covalent bond between the inhibitor and the
V-ATPase (11, 12). In the present report we show for the first
time that this derivative of concanamycin A, 9-O-[p-(trifluoro-
ethyldiazirinyl)-benzoyl]-21,23-dideoxy-23-[125I]iodo-concanol-

ide A (J-concanolide A), binds only to subunit c of the V-ATPase
from tobacco hornworm (M. sexta) midgut.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Purification of the V1/Vo ATPase and the Vo Complex—As many as 20
whole M. sexta midguts were dissected from feeding fifth instar larvae
and homogenized in ice-cold buffer A (5 mM Tris-HCl, 250 mM sucrose,
5 mM Pefabloc SC (Biomol), 5 mM Na-EDTA, pH 8.1). After centrifuga-
tion of the crude homogenate in a fixed-angle rotor at 12,000 ⫻ gmax for
5 min at 4 °C, the pellet was resuspended in buffer A and centrifuged
again. The resulting pellet was resuspended in buffer A and centrifuged
in a fixed-angle rotor at 233,000 ⫻ gmax for 30 min at 4 °C to yield a final
pellet that was solubilized in buffer B (16 mM Tris-HCl, 0.32 mM EDTA,
9.6 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and 0.1% C12E10, pH 8.1) at 4 °C with a
detergent to protein ratio of 2:1. After centrifugation in a fixed-angle
rotor at 233,000 ⫻ gmax for 1 h at 4 °C, the supernatant was layered on
a discontinuous sucrose density gradient (3 ml of 40%, 2 ml of 30%, 2 ml
of 20%, and 1.6 ml of 10% sucrose (w/v) dissolved in buffer B with 200
mM KCl and a lower detergent concentration of 0.01% C12E10) and
centrifuged in a vertical rotor at 339,000 ⫻ gmax for 90 min at 4 °C. The
30% sucrose fraction was diluted 4-fold with buffer C (20 mM Tris-HCl,
9.6 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% C12E10, pH 8.1) containing 50 mM
NaCl and subjected to anion exchange chromatography using a Mono Q
(Amersham Biosciences) column. The V1/Vo ATPase was eluted in a
linear salt gradient (50–400 mM NaCl dissolved in buffer C) at NaCl
concentrations between 250 and 280 mM. The last step in the purifica-
tion protocol was gel permeation chromatography on a Superdex 200
column (Amersham Biosciences), which was performed in buffer C
containing 150 mM NaCl. The final yield was ⬃1 mg of V-ATPase per 20
midguts.

For purification of the Vo complex, midguts of larvae starved for
16–20 h were prepared, homogenized, and centrifuged twice as de-
scribed above. The second pellet was resuspended in a buffer consisting
of 5 mM Tris-HCl, 0.8 M KI, 5 mM Na-EDTA, and 5 mM Pefabloc SC (pH
8.1) and incubated for 30 min on ice. Then the sample was diluted with
16 mM Tris-HCl, 0.32 mM EDTA, 9.6 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (pH 8.1) to
a KI concentration of 40 mM and centrifuged at 233,000 ⫻ gmax for 30
min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in the dilution buffer and
centrifuged again under the same conditions. The final pellet was
solubilized and purified as described above for the V1/Vo ATPase, except
for the use of 20% instead of the 30% sucrose fraction after rate zonal
centrifugation. The final yield of the preparation was ⬃0.5 mg of Vo
complex per 20 midguts.

Antibiotics—J-concanolide A as well as its 125I-labeled form were
synthesized as described elsewhere (11). Concanamycin A, bafilomycin
A1, and bafilomycin B1 were isolated according to published procedures
(12). Salicylihalamide was a generous gift from M. R. Boyd (National
Cancer Institute, MD, USA). To avoid freeze thaw cycles, which have
significant influence on the stability of the substances, aliquots of stock
solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide were stored at ⫺70 °C and thawed only
once immediately before use. The actual concentrations of the stock
solutions were determined spectrophotometrically.

ATPase Assays—ATPase assays with a final volume of 160 ␮l and a
pH of 8.1 contained 3–4 ␮g of protein, 50 mM Tris-Mops, 3 mM 2-mer-
captoethanol, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mM
sodium azide, 20 mM KCl, 0.003% C12E10, 20 mM NaCl, and 3 mM
Tris-HCl. After 5 min of preincubation at 30 °C with or without inhib-
itors, 1 mM Tris-ATP was added, and after an additional 2 min the
reaction was stopped by placing the reaction tubes in liquid nitrogen.
Determination of the produced inorganic phosphate followed the proto-
col of Wieczorek et al. (13).

Labeling—20 ␮g of the samples were incubated with varying concen-
trations of J-concanolide A in a volume of 30–40 ␮l for 1 h on ice or 3
min at room temperature and irradiated for 3 min with UV light (366
nm) on ice. After irradiation, 7.5–10 ␮l of 5-fold sample buffer (14) was
added. The mixture was heated for 45 s at 95 °C or 30 min at 40 °C,
cooled on ice, and subjected to SDS-PAGE (10–15% T, 3.3% C; (15)) or
to Tricine-SDS-PAGE (16.5% T, 3% C separating gel and 10% T, 3% C
spacer gel (16)), followed by Coomassie staining. The gels were either
dried on Whatman paper or sealed in plastic wrap before they were
exposed to a phosphoscreen for as many as 72 h and analyzed with the
aid of a phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics).

Mass Spectrometric Analysis—After SDS-PAGE of the purified V1/Vo
ATPase, the 100-kDa and the 17-kDa Coomassie-stained bands, respec-
tively, were prepared for mass spectrometry in a procedure adapted
from Shevchenko et al. (17) and Zhang et al. (18). Briefly, the proteins
were digested by trypsin or chymotrypsin in the gel, and the peptides

were mapped using MALDI-MS (TofSpec-2E, Micromass Ltd.,
Manchester, UK).

Other Procedures—Fifth instar larvae of M. sexta (Lepidoptera,
Sphingidae), weighing 6–8 g, were reared under long-day conditions
(16 h of light) at 27 °C using a synthetic diet modified according to Bell
et al. (19). The preparation of highly purified goblet cell apical mem-
branes followed published protocols (13, 20). SDS-PAGE, Western blot-
ting on nitrocellulose membranes, and immunostaining were performed
as described previously (13, 21).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Revised Purification Protocol Reveals Subunit a in the Insect
V-ATPase—The unequivocal assignment of an inhibitor such
as concanamycin or bafilomycin to a special V-ATPase subunit
requires experimental evidence for the existence of all consti-
tutive subunits in the V-ATPase preparation used. Although
nearly all subunits of the insect V-ATPase have been cloned
and sequenced (22, 23), we had so far not been able to identify
the 100-kDa subunit a of the insect V-ATPase unequivocally
(24–26). Because this subunit on the one hand appeared to be
very sensitive to proteolysis (27), and on the other hand was
proposed to be a candidate for bafilomycin binding (7), we
repeatedly modified purification protocols to recover a putative
subunit a, also in the insect V-ATPase. Degradation during the
process of purification was evidently not responsible for our
lack of evidence because even with complex cocktails of prote-
ase inhibitors we were not able to resolve subunit a (28).

Purification of the M. sexta V-ATPase according to a new
protocol as compared with previous procedures (Ref. 24, see
under “Experimental Procedures”) resulted, mainly because of
the presence of 200 mM KCl during zonal centrifugation of the
detergent-solubilized protein in a sucrose gradient, for the first
time in the detection of a 100-kDa subunit in an insect
V-ATPase preparation (Fig. 1, lane 3). The 100-kDa band re-
acted in immunoblots with polyclonal antibodies to the 116-
kDa subunit a of the V-ATPase from bovine chromaffin gran-
ules (Ref. 29, not shown, but see below the results for the Vo
complex), suggesting the existence of a 100-kDa subunit a, also
in the M. sexta midgut V-ATPase. Respective evidence had
already been provided recently by the demonstration of at least
two genes encoding a V-ATPase subunit a in the midgut (23).
Definitive proof that the 100-kDa band represented the
V-ATPase subunit a was finally obtained from MALDI-MS. A
number of tryptic peptides were found in the map of the protein

(Fig. 2A), providing 36% sequence coverage (compare Ref. 23
with GenBankTM accession no. AJ249390).

Purification of the Vo complex was facilitated by the fact that
goblet cell apical membranes of molting or starving M. sexta
larvae lose most of their V1 complexes by dissociation from the
membrane, whereas the Vo complexes remain membrane
bound (30, 31). Further treatment of the membranes with
chaotropic iodide (32) supported the dissociation of V1 com-
plexes, leaving virtually V1-free membranes. According to sil-
ver staining of SDS gels, the Vo complex appeared to consist of
five major protein bands with apparent molecular masses of
100, 40, 26, 20, and 17 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1, lane 4). Four
polypeptides could be identified as established Vo subunits by
staining Western blots with specific antibodies against the Vo
subunits a, d, and e, respectively (Fig. 1, lanes 6–8) or by
DCCD-labeling of subunit c (Fig. 1, lane 5). The fifth major
band with an apparent molecular mass of ⬃26 kDa was
N-terminally sequenced and appeared to be a dimer of subunit
c (data not shown).

Plecomacrolide Antibiotics Bind to Subunit c of the Insect
V-ATPase—J-concanolide A (Fig. 3) was synthesized as de-
scribed elsewhere (11). Two features of this potential inhibitor
appeared to be essential for the identification of the plecoma-
crolide binding subunit(s). First, the p-(trifluoroethyldiaziri-
nyl)-benzoyl group at position C9 generates, after treatment
with UV light, a highly reactive carbene, which itself can be
inserted into covalent bonds, especially C-H bonds. Second, the
125I at position C23 of the hemiketal ring could be used as a
radioactive tracer, thus making detection of the labeled subunit
by autoradiography possible.

Before performing labeling experiments we tested the inhib-
itory efficacy of J-concanolide A on the activity of the V-ATPase
holoenzyme. As shown in Fig. 4, J-concanolide A inhibited the
purified V-ATPase half-maximally at a concentration of 15–20
␮M, equivalent to an I50 value of ⬃0.6 ␮mol per mg of protein.
This value was 1000 times higher than that for the plecomac-
rolides concanamycin A and bafilomycin A1 and B1, respec-
tively, and the benzolactone enamide salicylihalamide. All of
these substances inhibited the M. sexta V-ATPase at submicro-
molar concentrations, with I50 values of ⬃0.5 nmol per mg and
with half-maximal concentrations of 10 nM. Although J-con-
canolide A was three orders of magnitude less inhibitory, it still
was an effective inhibitor with an I50 value comparable to that
of the Escherichia coli Kdp-ATPase for bafilomycins (4).

UV illumination of the purified M. sexta V-ATPase in the
presence of J-concanolide A led, after SDS-PAGE, Coomassie

at the exact position of the V-ATPase subunit c (Fig. 5A). The
identity of the band as subunit c was proven by MALDI-MS.
Analysis of tryptic and chymotryptic peptides resulted in a
sequence coverage of 76% with subunit c (Fig. 2B, compare Ref.
33 with GenBankTM accession no. X65051). However, two dis-
tinct masses of 1523,9 m/z and 1739,9 m/z, respectively, were
not covered by the known sequence of subunit c. These frag-

FIG. 6. Correlation between inhibition of V-ATPase activity by
J-concanolide A and bound radioactivity. Bands of subunit c from
the gel in Fig. 5A were excised. The bound radioactivities were meas-
ured in a ␥-counter and then compared with the enzyme activities. The
background radioactivity was subtracted by using an equivalent-sized
gel slice right to the lane with the lowest concentration of J-concanolide
A (0.1 ␮M). The radioactivity of the 100 ␮M band was set to 100%.

ments might derive from an isoform of the c subunit, c’, which
is present in V-ATPases of other species (2) but so far could not
be identified in M. sexta. On the one hand, genomic Southern
blots had suggested that there is only one single gene for
subunit c in M. sexta, but on the other hand, Northern blots had
revealed two transcripts (33). The latter finding may be inter-
preted as a hint in favor of a c’ isoform. Nevertheless, labeling
of the band representing subunit c and/or a putative isoform
was specific because it was dependent on the concentration of
J-concanolide A (Fig. 5A) and because labeling with 10 ␮M
J-concanolide A was prevented by preincubation with concen-
trations of concanamycin A ranging from 1 to 300 ␮M (Fig. 5B).
Fig. 5B shows that a concentration of 1 ␮M concanamycin was
not enough to displace J-concanolide A. At first glance this may
appear counterintuitive, because at a concentration of 0.1 ␮M
the V-ATPase activity was already inhibited nearly 100%.
However, one has to keep in mind that already the binding of
one molecule of concanamycin A to one of the probably six
subunits c in a Vo complex may lead to complete inhibition of

enzyme activity, whereas six molecules of concanamycin A
would be needed for complete displacement of J-concanolide A.
To verify the correlation between inhibition and labeling by
J-concanolide A, we cut out the Coomassie-stained bands of
subunit c from the SDS-PAGE gel and measured their radio-
activity in a ␥-counter. Indeed, a concentration-dependent cor-
relation between bound radioactivity and inhibition of the en-
zyme activity was found (Fig. 6). Labeling of the holoenzyme
subunit c evidently was specific for plecomacrolides, because it
was also prevented by bafilomycin A1 and B1, respectively (Fig.
5C). This finding implied that the binding site for both families
of plecomacrolide antibiotics, concanamycin and the bafilomy-
cins, in general resides in subunit c. At present, we cannot

Concanamycin A Binds to the V-ATPase Subunit c

explain the discrepancy between this result and the results
obtained with N. crassa mutants, which exhibited a higher
tolerance to bafilomycin but not to concanamycin (10). Because
labeling was not impaired by salicylihalamide, we conclude
that the site(s) and mechanism of inhibition for benzolactone
enamides may be different from that for plecomacrolides.

In another approach we used, in addition to the purified
holoenzyme, the purified Vo complex and highly purified goblet
cell apical membranes in which the V-ATPase is the predomi-
nant protein and, moreover, resides in its native lipid sur-
rounding (Fig. 7). Clear labeling of subunit c was again ob-
tained for the Vo complex as well as for the goblet cell apical
membrane.

Taken together, we provided for the first time direct proof
that subunit c, which forms the major part of the proton trans-
locating Vo complex of V-ATPases, carries the binding site for
plecomacrolide antibiotics. Experiments more precisely defin-
ing the site of covalent modification are in progress.
