ORIENTING  OF ATTENTION* 

MICHAEL I.  POSNER 

University of  Oregon 

Bartlett viewed thinking as a high level skill exhibiting ballistic properties that he 
called  its  “point  of  no  return”.  This paper  explores one  aspect  of  cognition 
through the  use  of  a  simple model task  in  which  human  subjects are asked  to 
commit attention to a position in visual space other than fixation.  This instruction 
is executed by orienting a covert (attentional) mechanism that seems sufficiently 
time locked to external events that its trajectory can be traced across the visual field 
in  terms  of  momentary  changes in the efficiency of  detecting stimuli.  A  com- 
parison of  results obtained with alert monkeys, brain  injured and normal human 
subjects shows the relationship of this covert system to saccadic eye movements and 
to various brain systems controlling perception and motion. 
In accordance with 
Bartlett’s  insight,  the  possibility  is  explored  that  similar  principles  apply  to 
orienting of attention toward sensory input and orienting to the semantic structures 
used in thinking. 

Introduction 

Sir Frederic Bartlett wrote a book, Thinking, during the last part of his life (Bartlett, 
1958).  It is not as widely known as his earlier work, Remembering (Bartlett, 1932), 
but it had a strong impact on me, perhaps because it was among the first psychology 
books I read.  Bartlett’s theme was as simple as it was powerful.  Thinking is a 
skill and should be studied with the techniques that had proved successful in the 
In  particular,  I  was  struck  with  Bartlett’s 
study  of  other  skilled  behaviour. 
metaphor  that  thinking  like  swinging  a  bat,  has  a  “point  of  no  return”.  Once 
committed in a particular  direction, thought is ballistic in that it cannot be altered. 
It may  be  hard  to understand  why  this  idea  should  have  been  so exciting  to 
someone  reading  the  psychological  literature  in  1959. 
In  retrospect,  what 
captured  the  imagination  must  have  been  the  idea  that  a  hidden  psychological 
process like the formation of  a thought  might be rendered  sufficiently concrete to 
measure.  Twenty years later, when psychologists routinely measure the speed of 
rotation  of  visual images (Cooper and  Shepard,  1973) or the time needed  to scan 
the next  item of  an internally  stored list (Sternberg,  1969), it is hard  to reinstate 
the excitement that the prospect of such research could have engendered in at least 
one reader of  Bartlett’s book. 

During the last few years of  research on human cognition, there has grown up a 
number  of  similar  views  of  how  the  human  nervous  system  is  organized  in the 
performance  of  species-specific  human  behaviour  such as reading (LaBerge and

Samuels, 1974; Posner, 1978).  The idea of  a limited capacity attentional system 
has  been  a  central feature  of  these  views.  Although  some have  argued  that  a 
skills  approach  is  antithetical  to  the  study  of  internal  attentional  mechanisms 
(Neisser, 1976), most work on skill has also assumed, with Bartlett, the importance 
of  mechanisms of  limited capacity (Broadbent, 1977). 

Currently,  the study of  spatial attention  in alert monkeys (Mountcastle,  1978 ; 
Wurtz and Mohler,  1976; Robinson, Goldberg and Stanton, 1978), brain injured 
persons (Weiskrantz, Warrington, Sanders and Marshall, I 974) and normal subjects 
(Posner, 1978, Chapter 7) seems to me to be a most promising model system for 
relating an important  component of  complex human  cognition to studies of  the 
neural systems underlying performance.  While orienting to stimuli in visual space 
is a restricted sense of  attention, I believe that its study is capable of providing us 
both with important tests of  the adequacy of  general models of  human  cognition 
and with new insights into the role of  attention in more complex human activity. 
Accordingly, this paper will be devoted to a discussion of the results of experiments 
in human  spatial attention and  a comparison of  them with  animal approaches to 
the same topic.  If  there should emerge satisfactory convergence between human 
performance and physiological approaches with this simple model system, I believe 
that the psychological methods used to explore attention in more complex tasks will

investigators of  neural systems toward  the needed  integration of  their  studies of 
separate anatomical structures. 

Orienting 

I will use the term orienting to mean the aligning of  attention with a source of 
sensory  input  or  an  internal  semantic structure  stored  in  memory.  The term 
orienting has been closely tied to a reflex (Sokolov, 1963), the operation of  which is 
indexed  by  a  variety  of  autonomic,  CNS and  overt  changes.  The idea  of  an 
orienting reflex is related to the mental operation of orienting as I use it.  However, 
the  orienting  reflex  does  not  distinguish between  aligning of  attention  and  the 
resulting perception of a stimulus. 

Detecting 

Detecting means to be aware or conscious of the stimulus. 

I  distinguish  orienting  from  another  cognitive  act  that  I  call  detecting. 

By 
detecting I will mean that a stimulus has reached a level of  the nervous system at 
which it is now possible for the subject to report its presence by arbitrary responses 
that the experimenter may  assign.  These may be verbal (“I  see it”) or manual

distinction  between  orienting  and  detecting  allows  one  to  explore  the  pro- 
position that some responses (e.g. saccadic eye movements) may be available to a 
stimulus before it has been detected in the sense used here.  This distinction makes 
it reasonable that a normal subject may move his eyes toward a stimulus, but not be 
able to otherwise report it, or that a brain damaged subject might have impairments 
in detecting an event to which he can orient (Weiskrantz, Warrington, Sanders and 
Marshall, 1974).

ORIENTING OF ATTENTION 

Lorn of control

It is also important to make a distinction between external and central control 
over orienting.  If  orienting to memory and to external stimuls events is to have a 
common base, it is clear that we must be able to orient attention in the absence of 
an external stimulus.  Similarly, movements of  the eyes can either be driven by 
stimulus input or result from a search plan internal to the organism. 

Overt and covert orienting 

Finally, it is important to  distinguish between overt changes in  orienting that 
can be observed in head and eye movements, and the purely covert orienting that 
may  be  achieved by the central mechanism alone.  In order to make this distinc- 
tion, one must be able to measure covert orienting by means other than observation 
of overt head and eye movements.  With human subjects it is possible to manipu- 
late the direction of  attention by an instruction, by changing the probability of  a 
target event, or by the use of appropriate overt movements.  To measure whether 
orienting occurs, changes in the efficiency of detecting events that occur at various 
spatial  positions  are  examined.  Some variant  of  mental  chronometry  (Posner, 
1978) such as reaction time (Posner, Nissen and Ogden, 1978), threshold detection 
(Remington, 1978), evoked potential amplitude (Von Voorhis and Hillyard,  1977) 
or changes in firing rates of  single cells (Mountcastle, 1976) can be used as a depen- 
dent measure of  processing efficiency. 

It is important to keep in mind the definitions of orienting and detecting and the 
distinction between external and central control as we review experimental evidence. 
Evidence is examined in four major sections.  The first establishes the ability of 
subjects to shift attention around the visual field in accordance with instructions. 
By measuring  both  the  facilitatory  and  inhibitory  effects  of  orienting  on  the 
efficiency of  detection,  it  is  possible  to  examine  the  relationship  of  the  covert 
attentional  mechanism  to  the  fine structure  of  the  retina.  The second section 
supports the idea of  analogue movements of  attention  across the visual field that 
are  measured  by  time  locking  of  attention  shifts  to  external  cues.  The third 
section  examines  the  relationship  between  movements  of  attention  and  overt 
changes of  eye position. 
In this section it is possible to compare our results with 
those arising from single cell recording and to distinguish between theories out- 
lining the relationship between  perceptual and  movement systems.  The fourth 
section deals with  the  crucial role  of  peripheral  stimuli  in  controlling attention 
movements.  The concluding portion  of  the paper  examines the  implications of 
our results on spatial attention for more complex performance. 

Attention shifts 

It is not obvious that shifting spatial attention involves anything more than the 
movement of  the  eyes to  positions in the visual field.  Certainly, no one would 
dispute the close connection between movements of our eyes and shifts of attention. 
Nonetheless, there  has  always been  speculation that  one  can  shift  attention  in- 
dependent of  eye movements.  For example, Wundt (1912, p. 20) commented on

the  ability  to  separate the  line  of  fixation  from  the  line  of  attention.  Natural 
language refers to the ability to look out  of  the  corner of  our eyes,  and  athletic 
coaches instruct their players to do so in order to confuse their opposition. 

Many experimental studies using methods of mental chronometry (Grindley and 
Townsend, 1968; Mertens, 1956; Mowrer, 1941; Shiffrin and Gardner, 1972) were 
not successful in showing this ability, at least in empty visual fields.  More recently, 
successful reports of  attention shifts in the absence of  eye movements have been 
frequent  (Eriksen  and Hoffman,  1973; Klein,  1979; Posner, Nissen  and  Ogden, 
1978; Shaw, 1978; Von Voorhis and Hillyard, 1977; Wurtz and Mohler, 1976). 

We (Posner, Nissen and Ogden,  1978) sought to determine whether responses 
to  clear  above threshold  luminance increments in  dark fields would  occur more 
quickly when subjects knew where the stimulus would occur than when they did 
not.  We used differences in reaction time to a stimulus at expected and unexpected 
positions in the visual field as a measure of the efficiency of detection due to turning 
attention toward the expected position.  T o  insure that the differences in reaction 
time did not depend upon shifting one's eyes, we monitored eye movements by use 
of EOG.  We used only those trials in which the eyes remained fixated.  In order 
to eliminate overt response preparations as a contributor, we  used either a single 
key  (simple  RT)  which  the  subject  pressed  regardless  of  where  the  stimulus 
occurred or made the response  choice unrelated  to stimulus position.  Figure  I 
illustrates the sequence of events within a trial.  The subject was presented with 
a plus sign or an arrow pointing to the right or left.  If  the plus sign was presented, 
the detection stimulus was  equally likely to occur to the left  or right  of fixation. 
If an arrow was presented, the probability was 0.8 that the detection stimulus would

the stimulus will occur, and the cost when it occurs at a position other than the 
expected position.

the trial is invalid in all these studies.  For any one task the costs and benefits are 
of roughly the same magnitude.  The simple RT conditions involve only a single 
key that the subject presses irrespective of  the location of  the signal.  The choice 
spatial task involves a report about whether the stimulus was higher or lower than 
the cue.  As in the simple RT task,  the  cue provides no information about the 
response that  is  most  likely.  The symbolic task  involves  a  report  concerning 
whether the target is a letter or digit. 
In the choice tasks there are no more errors 
in the valid condition than in the invalid condition although the effects of the cue 
on error rate are always small. 

The costs and benefits of  a spatial cue are highly regular and it may seem sur- 
prising that many previous efforts were not successful in finding improvements in 
RT or threshold detection in similar experiments.  One reason is that the overall 
effect seems to get smaller as the task is made more difficult.  Because our studies 
were run on separate subjects at different times, no direct comparison is appropriate, 
but the tendency for the effects of the choice RT tasks to be smaller than the simple 
RT tasks is striking.  This is especially true because many people expect attentional 
limitations only when overall task complexity is high (Kahneman, 1973 ; Norman 
and Bobrow, 1975).  If  the effect really is smaller in complex tasks, I believe that 
this may be because subjects have to reorient attention from visual input to internal 
structures.  If  subjects are required to discriminate between a letter and a digit,

for example, calling attention to a position in space will not be very useful in an 
empty  field  such  as  used  in  these  experiments.  Subjects will  have  to  reorient 
attention from spatial position to the area in memory that is available for analysis 
of  the discrimination.  Indeed, we (Posner, Snyder and Davidson, in press) found 
that when given a single key  to press whenever they saw a digit, subjects could 
hardly avoid false alarms when a letter appeared at the correct spatial position.  If 
two keys were given, subjects did benefit from their knowledge of  spatial position 
in  RT without  compensating increases  in  error  as  shown in  Figure  2, but  the 
benefits were small.  These ideas fit with the usual observation that knowledge of 
spatial position only helps complex tasks when the field is cluttered. 
In tasks where 
there are good methods of  quickly summoning attention, one might be better off 
not to know where the stimulus will occur rather than having to reorient from visual 
position to semantic code. 

There  is  another  reason  that  previous  investigations have  not  always found 
knowledge  of  spatial  position  to  aid  performance.  Our  basic  method  involves 
cuing on  each trial.  If,  instead, one spatial position  is made likely for a whole 
block of  trials, we  found no benefits for the frequent position in comparison with 
conditions in which all positions are equally likely (Posner, Snyder and Davidson, 
in press), although there were small costs at the infrequent position.  This result 
fits with  the  active  nature  of  orienting.  Orienting  does  not  seem to  involve a 
passive filter that can easily be set in place and left.  Rather, an active process of 
maintaining the orientation seems important. 

Our method  can be exploited in an effort to understand  the way  in which the 
visual system constrains spatial attention.  It is a common conviction that foveal 
stimuli have a more direct relation to attention than peripheral stimuli.  Physio- 
logists  sometimes believe the  reverse  based  on  the idea  that  transient  (r cells) 
dominate in the periphery. 
In fact, costs and benefits from attention did not vary 
much when we studied stimuli from 0-5  to 25 degrees eccentricity (Posner, 1978, 
p.  202). 

This result led us to examine more completely the costs of  an unexpected foveal 
stimulus when the subject was attending outside the fovea vs. those of an unexpected 
peripheral stimulus when he was attending to the fovea.  We found roughly the 
same cost  for  an  unexpected  event  when  it  is  foveal  as when  it  is  peripheral* 
(Posner, 1978, p.  202). 

What  accounts for  the  strong  subjective feeling that  the  fovea represents  the 
centre  of  the  attentional  field?  In my view, it is as important for a psychologist 
to  account for  this  subjective feeling as  it  is  to  account  for  the  objective  data. 
Fortunately, it turns out to be possible to study this question.  If subjects are given 
a  cue as to which  side is more likely, but  are not  told  if  the stimulus will be a 
peripheral  or  a  foveal  one,  they  uniformly  prepare  for  the  peripheral  stimulus 
(Posner, 1978, Figure  7.8).  Their  strategy assumes  that  the fovea will take care 
of  itself, even though our data say clearly that the costs in R T  will be as great as 
*This result has implications for some of the theories arising from single cell recording at parietd 
levels.  For  example, Yin  and  Mountcastle (1977) argued that  the  attention system they  were 
studying did not involve foveal  representation.  If  they had  been right, this would  be  evidence 
against area 7 being crucial in the kind of spatial orientation reported here.  More recently, foveal 
representation has been found in these cells (Bushnell et ul., 1978; Mountcastle, Note 3).

for the periphery.  The strategy must arise from the correlation between the fovea 
and attention brought about by the eye movement system. 

When a task demands acuity (upper panel, Fig. 3), as in the work of Engle (1971), 
the fovea does play a special role (middle panel, Fig. 3).  This contrasts with the 
luminance detection results illustrated in the bottom panel of  Figure 3 in which 
attention is unrelated to the fovea.  Although orientation to the periphery allows 
detection to occur more quickly, it does not provide an increase in the retinal grain

FIGURE 3.  Upper panel indicates a high acuity task  of  searching visual  noise for an  L shaped 
figure studied by Engle (1971).  As shown in the middle panel the fovea always plays a special role 
even though attention can expand the area of high conspicuity in the direction of the attention point. 
Lower panel contrasts our results in which the focus of attention shifts away from the fovea to be

and thus does not produce strong acuity changes.  Attention represents a system 
for routing information and for control of  priorities.  It does not provide a sub- 
stitute for the sensory specific wiring intrinsic to the visual system.  Ells and  I 
(Note  I) observed that  subjects adjust their  behaviour  differently in luminance 
detection and  in  acuity  experiments.  In  a  luminance detection experiment, if 
subjects are told they  can move their  eyes on each individual trial  if  they wish, 
after a few trials they give up doing so.  They quickly recognize that it is an effort 
to move their eyes and that it does not help performance.  On the other hand, if 
free to  move  in an acuity  demanding task,  they  clearly prefer to  do  so and the 
different levels of performance with foveal and nonfoveal vision confirm the wisdom 
of  their preference. 

Overall these  results  have  something to  say  about  the  problem  of  ecological 
validity in perceptual experiments.  It is true that the separation between attention 
and the fovea that  occurs in  our experiments is not  a normal property of  visual 
perception.  It  is  revealed  only  under  the  close  experimental  control  of  the 
laboratory.  Nonetheless, it appears that subjects do not adopt a special strategy 
in our experimental task, but rather carry over their natural tendencies from every- 
day perception.  Under our special conditions we learn that the normal correlation 
between  fovea  and  attention  occurs as  a  result  of  the  usual  demands  for  high 
acuity and not as a result of any special wiring that ties attention to foveal stimulation. 
Only because our luminance detection task does not demand high acuity are we able

to observe that the covert mechanisms of  attention are not tied intrinsically to the 
fine structure of  the visual system. 

Attention movements 

The introduction to this paper remarked on the importance of  time locking as a 
way of  bringing together physiological and behavioural methods for the investiga- 
tion of  spatial attention.  It is important to ask whether the shift in efficiency that 
we have found when subjects move their  attention is sufficiently time locked that 
measurements of  attention  movements might  be  made.  One indication of  such 
time locking is found in work by Jonides (Note 2).  He varied the time interval 
between  the  cue  and  stimulus  in  studies  otherwise like those  I have described. 
Jonides found quite clearly that he could trace the time course of efficiency changes 
over  a  few  hundred  milliseconds.  He  also  found  a  rather  marked  difference 
between the time course of  efficiency when the subject's attention was brought to 
a position in space by a peripheral cue and when it was so directed by  a central 
cue.  The differences between a central and a peripheral cue will become important 
as we begin to look at the relationship between the time locked attentional movement 
and time locked movements of  the eyes. 
Shulman, 
Remington  and  McLean  (1979) asked  the  question  whether  movements across 
the visual field are digital or analogue in form.  The eye moves across the visual 
field continuously, although in one sense the efficiency of  its performance is digital 
since thresholds for taking in stimuli tend to be raised during the saccade.  The 
technique used  by  these three investigators was to ask whether a visual detection 
stimulus that occurred on less than  10% of trials at a position between the fixation 
point and a target would show facilitation in latency at a time intermediate between 
leaving the home  position and reaching the target.  If  so, one could expect R T  
for this position first to improve relative to the target as attention moved through 
it, and then to get worse relative to the target. 

For  the  moment  we  will  consider only  the  use  of  a  central  cue. 

Each trial began with an arrow cue which instructed subjects to move attention 
to  a  visible  target  18" from  fixation.  At  varying  intervals  following this  cue 
(SOA), detection stimuli were presented.  The detection stimuli occurred on 75% 
of  the trials, the remainder  serving as catch trials.  On trials where there was a 
detection stimulus  it  occurred at  the  designated target  of  70%  of  the time.  It 
occurred at the intermediate position on the cued side, at a position opposite the 
target or at an intermediate point on the side opposite the target, each with prob- 
ability 0-1. 

The result of  one experiment is shown in Figure 4. 

The most salient feature 
in the data is the U-shaped function relating reaction time to interval following the 
cue (SOA) for all positions.  This alerting effect is well documented in reaction 
Re- 
time literature. 
action time to lights near fixation is generally faster than to lights far from fixation. 
In these experiments the  crucial measure that addresses the question whether 
movements are  analogue  or  discrete is  the  difference between  reaction  time  to 
target (far expected) and intermediate light on the target side (near expected) as a 

There is also an advantage to those lights near the fovea.

vergence." 
At 
this  point  attention  appears to  give the greatest relative advantage to  the  inter- 
mediate probe.  Although these  effects are small they  are sufficiently consistent 
to  reach  statistical significance and  to  allow us  a  provisional  decision that  time 
locking can occur and that the analogue model is supported by the data. 

Relationship between attention and movement 

Orienting to positions in space can be obtained covertly through movements of 
attention  or  overtly through shifts of  the head  and  eyes.  No  one would  doubt 
that these two are very closely coupled in daily life.  There has been interest in 
the degree of relationship of  the internal mechanisms controlling attention and eye 
movement.  Much of  the relevant literature  comes from single cell recording in 
alert monkeys.  Goldberg and Wurtz (1972) showed at the level of  the superior 
colliculus enhancement in the firing rate of  single cells whose receptive field was to 
be the target for an eye movement at a latency well before the eyes began to move. 
At first they were inclined to identify this system with a general attention mech- 
anism because the time course did not seem to couple it closely with eye movements. 
Later, it was shown (Wurtz and Mohler, 1976) that methods of producing attention 
to events outside of  the fovea other than by inducing eye movements did not pro- 
duce enhancement  of  collicular cells.  At  the  level of  the superior  colliculus it 
appeared that  selective enhancement was  intrinsically related to eye movements. 
Work by Mountcastle (1976) could be viewed  as suggesting a direct relationship 
between  enhancement of  single  cells in the  parietal lobe and  movement  of  the 
hands and eyes into the surrounding environmental space.  However, Mountcastle 
(I 978) explicitly recognizes the contingent nature of  the movements generated in 
response to parietal activity. 

There was reason from our data to deny too close a relationship between attention 
and  overt  eye  movements.  The  costs  and  benefits  of  attention  shifts  neither 
depend upon movements of the eyes nor seem to be closely related to distance from 
the fovea. 
Indeed, our finding that attention shifts are symmetric between peri- 
phery  and  fovea  suggests a  different structure from  that  of  the  eye  movement 
system.  Subsequent work on single cell recording (Robinson, Goldberg and Stan- 
ton,  1978; Bushnell, Robinson and Goldberg,  1978) shows selective enhancement 
of  single cells in parietal lobe (area 7) without eye movements and argues that such 
cells are more  closely related to visual properties of  the stimulus than to motor 
commands. 

*It is important to note that no similar pattern of divergence or convergence is found with stimuli 
that occur on the side opposite the cued target.  In unpublished work we found that alerting alone, 
with no cue as to where to direct attention, produces uniform improvements in R T  to detection 
events at differing places from fixation.  The usual advantage of foveal over peripheral events was 
also present.  Thus the pattern of interaction found for the intermediate and target events on the 
cued side  depends on  the  instruction to  move  attention in  that  direction.  The  results that  we 
obtained for pure alerting argue that alerting does not introduce a bias in the distribution of attention 
over the visual field as might be expected from some views of the relationship between arousal and 
performance.

that attention can be shifted with eyes fixed, together with results showing enhance- 
ment of  evoked potentials (Eason, Harter and White, 1969; Von Voorhis and Hill- 
yard, 1977) and of  the firing rates of  single cells (Bushnell et al., 1978), eliminates 
the idea that attention and eye movements are identical systems. 

These findings led Wurtz  and  Mohler (1976) to propose  that  attention  shifts 
were programmes for the movement of the eyes.  This might be called an efference 
theory.  Klein (1979) describes this  view as follows: “When attention to a par- 
ticular location is desired, the observer prepares to make an eye movement to that 
location; the oculomotor readiness, via as yet unknown feedforward pathways, has 
the effect of  enhancing processing in or from sensory pathways dealing with infor- 
mation from the target location”. 

A less restrictive notion of  the relationships between the two forms of  movement 
would  be  that  attention  and  eye  movements are  both  summoned by  important 
peripheral events and thus have a  close functional but  no intrinsic physiological 
relationship.  An even less restrictive view would be to posit complete functional 
and physiological independence between the two systems. 

Efference 

The efference view proposes a restricted relation between our  ability to move 
attention and the eyes.  It indicates that whenever one moves attention to a loca- 
tion, eye movements in that direction are facilitated and that the readiness to move 
the eyes to a target necessarily improves detection there.  Klein (1979) examined 
both of  these hypotheses.

There are two kinds of  trials. 

with a cue. 
On eye movement trials  an asterisk 
appears  to the  left  or  right  of  fixation.  On  detection trials  the  subjects  must 
respond to a luminance increment by pressing a key. 

Experiment I has only a small proportion of  eye movement trials. 

Most trials 
involve detection to insure that the subject uses the cue to shift attention to the 
expected position. 
There 
was  no  effect  of  the  cue on eye movement latencies.  When  the  subject has to 
move his eyes in the direction he is attending, he is no faster than when he moves 
opposite to the direction of  attention. 

He found clear costs and benefits on detection trials. 

In Experiment I1 eye movements are the primary task and detection trials were 
used to assess the prediction that detection will be faster for a stimulus presented 
at the target for the eye movement.  One group of  subjects was instructed to move 
their eyes right and a separate group to move them left on each eye movement trial. 
When the imperative stimulus for the eye movement is in the direction of the actual 
movement (compatible) eye movements are faster than when it is not (incompatible). 
However, the detection task is totally unaffected by the direction in which the subject 
moves his eyes. 

These results show clearly that  there  are conditions under  which  one gets no 
relationship between  spatial attention  shifts and eye movement latencies.  Thus 
they are sufficient to reject an efference theory as a full account of  the relationship 
of eye movement and attention movement.  However, Klein's experiments involve 
difficult conditions for the subjects.  The subject first has to determine if he is in a 
detection or an eye movement trial based on the type of stimulus change.  On some 
trials  eye  movements are  opposite to  the  direction  of  the visual input.  These 
conditions produce  long  RTs.  As  illustrated  in  Figure  I,  complex  conditions 
produce the poorest evidence for spatial attention effect.  While the experiments 
are sufficient to refute the forced conjunction between eye movement and attention, 
they do not give us a very good handle on how these two might be linked under less 
difficult conditions.  Some recent studies (Nissen, Posner  and  Snyder,  Note  4; 
Remington, 1978) provide a view of  the relationship between eye movement and 
attention movements under simpler conditions. 

Combined eye and attention movements 

In our experiments the subject's attention and eye movement are summoned by 
a  I'  unfilled box that occurs 8" to the left or right of  a similar fixation box.  The 
detection stimulus is a clear dot well above threshold.  The sequence of events in 
a trial is shown in Figure 8.  The detection stimulus occurs with equal probability 
in the fixation box or at the target. 

Figure 9 shows mean RTs for detection stimuli at fixation and at the target as a 
function of  time  following the peripheral eye movement cue.  The results show 
that by  50 to  IOO ms after the occurrence of  the target stimulus for the eye move- 
ment,  one gets benefits in  reaction  time  to  a  detection  event  that  occurs at the 
target, in comparison to the position at which the subject is currently looking.  This 
time course is roughly consonant with the results obtained by Goldberg and Wurtz 
(1972) for the latency of collicular unit enhancement.  Thus where eye movements

and attention are conjoined by the occurrence of  a peripheral stimulus, the move- 
ment of attention seems to precede the movement of  the eyes. 

Because of  the use of  the reaction time technique, it is difficult to be sure that 
the earliest point at which one gets facilitation is the point at which attention has 
shifted to the  peripheral position.  To address this  question,  Remington (1978) 
required his subjects to detect a 3 ms luminance increment.  Otherwise, the basic 
paradigm is similar to the one shown in Figure  8.  Each trial begins with three 
boxes in the field.  At time o a plus sign appears over one of the peripheral boxes 
indicating the eye movement direction.  The detection stimulus occurs with equal 
probability at the fixation point, the target, or on the side opposite the target. 

Prior to the presentation of  the eye movement target (plus sign) the subject is 
most sensitive at the fovea.  By IOO ms after the occurrence of the target event and 

16 

M. I.  POSNER 

well before the eyes have started to move, the subject shows higher sensitivity at 
the target  position than  either  at fixation or  opposite sides.  Shortly before the 
eyes begin to move there is a reduction in probability of detection that could be due 
to saccadic suppression.  Finally, when the eyes reach  the target,  the subject is 
now more sensitive in the position of  the target than at the original fixation.  The 
effects are all small but sufficiently consistent to be statistically significant.  They 
show that in the presence of  a stimulus which elicits eye movement, the subject’s 
attention tends to move prior to his eyes.’ 

These two experiments show that there is a strong tendency for attention to shift 
to  the  target  position  for an eye movement prior to the eye leaving the fixation 
point.  The time course for this attention shift is in the neighbourhood of ~
ms following the peripheral target presentation which is about the same as reported 
for  selective  enhancement  of  collicular  units  by  Goldberg  and  Wurtz  (1972). 
This result  argues for a  firmer link  between  attention  and eye movements than 
was suggested by  Klein’s result. 
In both  of  these experiments detection stimuli 
were  equally likely to occur at the target for the eye movement or at the fixation 
point. 
In order to investigate the strength  of  the link between overt and  covert 
orienting,  we wanted  to  see if  subjects would  be  able  to  maintain  attention  at 
fixation if  given incentive to  do  so.  It is  very  difficult to know  introspectively 
whether attention can be maintained at fixation when generating an eye movement. 
To provide an incentive for subjects to attend to the fixation if  they could, we 
increased the probability that the detection stimulus would be presented there to 
0.8, with a probability of 0-2 that it would occur at the target.  We ran two different

were to remain fixated at all times. 
In the other condition they were to move their 
eyes as quickly as possible after the target box was presented. 
In all other respects 
the two conditions were identical  In our first experiment six subjects were run 
under each of  these conditions. 

I O O  

The results of our experiment are shown in Figure 10. 

In the fixation condition 
it is clear that a high probability stimulus that occurs on the fovea is detected much 
more rapidly at all intervals than a low probability peripheral event.  There is no 
evidence that the occurrence of the peripheral target event per se improves detection 
in  its  location  relative  to  fixation.  In  the  movement  condition  the  detection 
stimulus is responded to more rapidly when it occurs at the target rather than at 
fixation at about 50 ms following input.  These subjects become faster at detecting 
a peripheral event of low probability than at detecting an event which falls on the 
fovea and is of  much higher Probability.?  There is a reversal after the eyes land 
There is a small but 
not significant tendency for the detection of events on the opposite side of the target to be facilitated 
in  the period  shortly before and after target presentation.  This suggests that  subjects may  &st 
show increased sensitivity to  both  sides as  they await the  cue as to  the  direction of  movement. 
This ability to split attention has  not been found in other luminance detection studies, however 
(Posner, Snyder and Davidson, in press).  It is also of potential importance that the attention shifts 
Remington found seem to occur prior to evidence for saccadic suppression. 

*There are a number of other interesting features of the Remington study. 

tThis experiment showed the most striking results favouring the target.  Subsequent experiments 
using similar procedures have not always yielded a striking cross over favouring the target during the 
period before the eye movement.  We have replicated the relative shift in detection RT favouring 
the target even though many subjects do not reverse the normal advantage in R T  favouring foveal 
stimuli.

on the target stimulus.  By 300 ms the subjects are fixating the target, but at our 
next  probe  time,  which  is  500  ms,  they  show  more  sensitivity to  the  original 
fixation point at which they are no longer looking than at the target.  Once they 
reach the target attention seems clearly under the control of  the probabilities. 

These results  confirm in a different paradigm the idea that the trajectories of 
attention movements can be traced dynamically over time (Shulman et al., 1979). 
Attention moves rapidly prior  to the  eye  movement  and  returns  to  the  original 
fixation as the fovea settles in at the target.  Even with  the incentive of  a high 
probability detection stimulus at fixation, subjects do not maintain attention while 
programming the  eye  movement.  At  first this  finding may  seem  to  contradict 
Klein's rejection of efference theory.  Certainly it suggests a non-trivial tie between 
overt and covert orienting that cannot easily be resisted by the subject.  However, 
we  had the distinct impression that  we  were able to return  attention to fixation 
even as the eye was moving toward the target.  Since there were no probe events 
around 300 ms we were not able to confirm the impression in this experiment. 

To see if  attention  could move in  a direction opposite to eye movement pro- 
gramming, we instituted blocks in which the subject fixated at the left edge of the 
cathode ray screen.  At time o a target occurred 8" to the right of  fixation.  Four 
hundred  milliseconds later  a  second  target  occurred  8" further  to  the  right  of 
fixation.  The subject's task was to move his eyes as quickly as possible from the 
original fixation point to the first target and then, following the occurrence of  the 
second target, to move his eyes again.  Detection stimuli occurred at the original 
fixation with probability 0.8 and at the position of the first target with a 0.2 prob- 
ability.  Our  interest was  in  whether the subject would tend  to move attention 
back to the original fixation point, even as his eyes were preparing to move to a target

shortly  before  and  during  the  reaction  time  to  the  second target  event, 
results  are  shown  in  Figure  11. 

Thus we were interested in detection events which occurred

initially responded to somewhat faster than those that occur at the target.  As the 
subject begins to prepare to move his eyes to the first target there is an improvement 
in the efficiency of  detecting stimuli at that target by comparison with the fixation 
point.  This replicates the shift found in the previous studies, but here does not 
actually yield reliably faster reaction times to the target than to the fixation point. 
However, for the crucial events (300-400 ms following the original target) that occur 
during the time the subject reaches the first target and is preparing to begin the 
movement  to  the  second  target,  reaction  times  back  at  the  initial  fixation  are 
significantly better than at the first target stimulus at which he is currently fixated. 
Since reaction times to the second movement  are very rapid,  it  is clear that the 
programming of the eyes is in the direction opposite to the movement of attention. 
These results agree with Klein’s (1979) conclusion and seem fatal to an efference 
theory. 

Functional relationships 

Overall, our results suggest that the relationship between eye movements and 
attention  is  not  as  close  as  either  a  complete dependence  or  an  efference view 
requires.  Our  studies  showing  attention  movements  with  eyes  fixed,  Klein’s 
finding of  no influence on eye movement latencies of  shifts of  attention,  and our

when  detection signals are more probable at fixation shows that the two  can be 
exquisitely related. 

We conclude that the relation is a functional one. 

It often depends more upon 
the  presentation  of  an  important  peripheral  event  than  on  the  eye  movement 
toward that event.  If  the peripheral event is not important, subjects can clearly 
avoid moving attention to it, as is shown by the fixation condition of  Figure  10. 
Making the stimulus a target for an eye movement is a particularly good way  to 
make it important,  but very  clearly not the only way.  An  instruction to attend 
to the stimulus is also sufficient, as we have shown in the central cue experiments" 
In many ways the relationship between eye and attention movements resembles 
that found to hold between eye and hand movements (Posner and Cohen, in press). 
The eye and hand function in close relationship to one another in many tasks, yet 
the physiological systems for their control are quite distinct.  The eye frequently 
moves to stimuli in anticipation of  hand movements, but one can easily move the 
hand with the eyes fixed. 
Indeed, even when one is instructed to move the two 
in synchrony toward a target, they may  become erroneously dissociated (Posner, 
Nissen  and  Ogden,  1978).  If  one  is  instructed  to  move  hand  and  eye  rapidly 
toward  a visual stimulus that  is  very  likely  to  arise from one  position,  then  on 
occasions when the expectancy is wrong  the  hand  has  a tendency to  follow the 
expectancy while the eye is controlled by the visual input.  Comparisons of central 
cues  and  peripheral  input  have  proved  useful  in  understanding  the  functional 
interconnections of the control systems for hand and eye movements.  The next 
section examines a similar strategy for understanding the control of  the overt and 
covert components of  orienting. 

Central and peripheral control of orienting 

Attention can be directed by a central decision, as discussed in section two of this 
paper, or it can be drawn by  a peripheral stimulus, as is done in the experiments 
discussed in the last section.  Comparisons of exogenous (reflexive) and endogenous 
(central) control  of  orienting  is  made  difficult because  external  signals  do  not 
operate completely reflexively but will only summon attention and eye movements 
if  they  are  important  to the  subject.  Moreover, central  mechanisms that  may 
control covert orienting, such as the parietal lobe also receive input from subcortical 
centres involved in overt orienting.  Nonetheless,  it would be useful to attempt 
to compare central and peripheral systems for producing changes in orienting as a 
model system for the interaction of  external and internal control. 

Remington (1978) compared peripheral and central cues for eye movements in 
*These conclusions appear to be in accord with recent observations (Kowler and Steinman, 1979) 
showing oculomotor drifts in the direction of the subjects expectancy when they are induced either 
by the requirement to move the eyes or by the expectation of a peripheral signal even when fixation 
is  maintained.  The  extent  of  voluntary  control over the  oculomotor  drift may  be  less  than  for 
attention movements, however.

order  to  determine  their  relationship  to  shifts  of  attention.  When  he  used  a 
peripheral cue he found improved sensitivity in the vicinity of the peripheral target 
about  50  ms after the cue and  well  before the eye movement.  When a  central 
arrow was  used  to  cue the movement,  there  was  no  evidence of  any  change in 
sensitivity in the direction of the target until after the eye movement began.  This 
result  is  not  consistent with  as  strong a  connection between  attention  and  eye 
movements as an efference theory would require.  It is consistent with the idea 
that  both  attention  and  the  eyes tend  to  be  drawn  to  peripheral  stimuli,  with 
attention movements occurring somewhat more rapidly.  A comparison of the eye 
movement latency in Remington's two experiments confirms the general advantage 
of  peripheral over central eye movements of  about 50  ms. 

Recently, Yoav  Cohen and  I (Posner and  Cohen, in press) have reported  be- 
havioural evidence of  a qualitative difference between control of  eye movements 
from peripheral and  central cues. 
In these experiments we compared binocular 
viewing with conditions in which only the left or right eye viewed the stimulus. 
Subjects were instructed  to  move their  eyes in  the  direction that  seemed most 
natural. 
In all trials the stimuli were pairs of  dots that occurred  10' to the left 
or right of fixation.  On most trials one of the dots led the other by 150 or 500 ms. 
Under these conditions subjects got used to moving their eyes to whatever stimulus 
occurred  first.  When  the  two  stimuli  occurred  simultaneously, with  binocular 
viewing there was no movement bias, but with monocular viewing subjects moved 
their eyes 80%  of  the time in the direction of the temporal visual field. 

This result was not due to a general movement bias. 

When a central visual or 
auditory cue was substituted  for the lateralized input, the bias of  moving toward 
the temporal visual field was lost. 

There were also clear differences between conscious judgement of which stimulus 
occurred  first  (temporal order judgements)  and  eye  movements induced  by  the 
In these studies pairs of  dots with time differences of 
same stimulus conditions. 
0, 10, 30 or 60 ms were used.  Conscious judgements were greatly influenced by 
which stimulus came first (ranging from 80-90~~ correct when either event led by 
60  ms)  and  were  only  slightly influenced  by  the  eye  that  was  occluded.  Eye 
movements were influenced much  less strongly by  the time  difference but were 
markedly affected by the viewing eye.  These results suggest that temporal visual 
field input has more direct access to systems controlling exogenously produced eye 
movements than does nasal visual field input. 

There are also anatomical reasons for supposing that crossed fibres have stronger 
input to the superior colliculus than do uncrossed fibres (Kaufman, 1974).  How- 
ever, to  our  knowledge, this  is  the first  exploration of  functional asymmetry of 
external control over eye movements to be reported with normal human adults.* 
It will be interesting to find out whether covert orienting resembles the eye move- 
ment system in being more influenced by contralateral input or whether it appears 
to be more like conscious judgements in being relatively symmetric. 

*A very recent abstract (Lewis, Maurer and Milewski, 1979) suggests that newborns have a strong 
functional asymmetry favouring the temporal visual  field that is reduced over the first two months 
of life.  This observation seems to fit closely with our adult data and may provide an opportunity 
to investigate its neural locus by studies of maturation.

ORIENTING OF ATTENTION 

21 

These studies provide potential methods for studying fundamental differences 

in the external and central control of overt orienting. 

Conclusions 

The most important  outcome of this research concerns our ability to measure 
the movements of  attention across the visual field.  The time locking of  shifts of 
attention, both to central instructional cues and to changes in eye position, provides 
evidence that covert orientation can be measured with almost as much precision 
and  ease  as  overt  shifts in eye  position.  The convergence of  measurements of 
sensory thresholds, reaction time and electrical activity on common questions and, 
to some extent, common results, gives some assurance that the observed change of 
efficiency is genuine.  These findings may  do more than add to the catalogue of 
internal mental activity that has been successfully measured in recent years.  The 
centrality of  attention to mental theories and the breadth and precision of methods 
involved in its measurement suggest a wealth of new issues that may now be ready 
for analysis. 

An alternative language for discussing orienting is in terms of  signal detection 
theory.  One  could  discuss  our  results  as  being  due  to  shifts  in  criterion  as 
probability and momentary expectancy varies.  Elsewhere we have discussed some 
of  the  disadvantages of  this  signal  detection language as  applied to  our  results 
(Posner, Snyder and Davidson, in press).  Some of our findings place constraints 
on the nature of  criterion shifts that seem antithetical to the use of that language. 
These include differences between  cued  and blocked  presentation, reductions in 
costs and benefits with  increases in task difficulty, facilitation of  low probability 
probes that lie between fixation and target,  shifts in efficiency toward  the target 
for  the  eye  movement  even  when  fixation stimuli  are  more  probable,  and  the 
relative  difficulty of  dividing attention  between  non-contiguous spatial positions 
(Posner, Snyder and Davidson, in press).  While such results may be described 
as placing gambles at expected spatial positions, they seem to imply a mechanism 
that severely limits and constrains the possible criteria. 

Much  work  on  orienting  (Sokolov,  1963) has  confounded  the  alignment  of 
attention to a source of input with the detection of a stimulus event.  The orienting 
reflex does not distinguish between the processes that occur prior to detection and 
that which occurs subsequently.  The relatively slow nature of  autonomic changes 
often precludes such a division.  Although our method of  measuring orienting is 
via changes in the efficiency of detecting, the two mental operations must be quite 
distinct.  Since one can move attention to a potential source of  signals before any 
input  has  occurred, it is  clear  that  orienting can  occur without  detection.  For 
overt orienting this is obvious, but it has not been  as obvious that  orienting and 
detection are two quite distinct internal operations of  attention. 

The ability to dissociate the two in normal subjects fits well with observations 
that  emerge  from  data  on  brain  injured  individuals.  In the  case  of  occipital 
lesions (field cuts) it has been shown that there  can be  a relative sparing of  the 
ability to do overt orienting combined with a striking deficit in the ability to detect 
(be aware of) stimuli in the blind field (Gassel and Williams,  1963; Perenin and

Jeannerod,  1978 ; Weiskrantz, Warrington, Sanders and Marshall, 1974).  On the 
other  hand,  damage in the right  parietal region can be described as producing a 
severe deficit in orienting with a less severe loss in the ability to detect a stimulus 
once  orienting  is  accomplished  (Heilman  and  Watson,  1977).  When  only  one 
event is presented, subjects may show good acuity in the neglected field, but when 
competing  events  are  presented  there  is  a  deficit  in  orienting  toward  the  side 
opposite the lesion.  The view that brain injury may dissociate more completely 
mental functions that are isolable by chronometric analysis in normals (Posner, in 
press) seems one of  the general principles that may emerge from sustained inter- 
action of  cognitive and neuroscience thinking. 

The important  effect  that  parietal  lobe  damage  has  for  orienting  in  humans 
supports the view that some portions of  the mechanisms for selective attention to 
space rely upon this part of  the brain.  This line of  reasoning underlies the effort 
made in this paper to relate our findings on spatial attention to observations being 
made in area 7 by  single cell investigators."  There is a tendency when looking 
at association areas of  the brain  to  identify their  activity with  either  sensory or 
motor systems.  An important  idea emerging from studies of  attention suggests 
that there are unique properties of internal structures that preclude their identifica- 
tion with either sensory or motor systems.  Our data show that attention  is not 
intrinsically tied to the foveal structure of the visual system nor slaved to the overt 
movements of  the eye. 

Attention movements have properties that are analogous to the skilled movements 
of  the hand and eye.  This is the theme that Bartlett proposed as a way toward 
the objective study of  thought.  It remains to establish that attention in the sense 
develoned in this paper is related to the attentional system postulated by cognitive 
theories of  internal thought processes.  It is one thing to claim that ideas for the 
sturlv of  spatial attention  arose from  an effort  to  confirm models of  the  role  of 
attention in tasks related to language and thought,  but it is quite another to show 
that  studies  of  simple  luminance  detection  will  increase our  understanding  of 
complex performance.  On a very general level it seems that evolution has selected 
similar principles of  movement for the hand, the eye and covert visual attention. 
It  seems  reasonable  to  suppose  that  orienting  in  semantic  memory  will  take 
advantage of  these same principles. 

There are a number  of promising avenues open for linking evidence on spatial 
orienting to the mechanisms used for orienting to internal mental structures.  Let 
me outline a few places where concepts arising from work in spatial orienting and 
those from work in orienting to higher level systems seem to be related.  Analogue 
processes have  been  shown in mental rotation  (Cooper and  Shepard,  1973) and 
scanning of images (Kosslyn, 1973).  Similarly, the effects of distance in semantic 
space (Rosch,  1975) on  reaction time  suggest they  are  also applicable to verbal 
concepts.  This work  suggested the studies on  analogue attentional movements. 
The buildup of  benefits and  costs with  the shift of  thought  from one idea (e.g. 
letter or semantic category) to another has been traced in some detail (McLean and

ORIENTING  OF ATTENTION

Shulman, 1978; Neely,  1977).  It remains to be shown if  evidence of  activation- 
based orienting found in semantic memory (McLean and Shulman, 1978) will also 
apply to spatial orientation.  When stimulus input controls the shift of  attention 
toward  an internal  structure it  has been  found that  benefits occur  before  costs. 
When a letter primes a pathway there is first a general commitment of  attention 
followed after time by the specific costs to letters other than the one primed.  One 
might expect that the arrow cues used in spatial orienting will produce a similar 
structure.  Becker and Killion (1977) have shown that the amount of  cost to an 
unexpected word  is  reduced  as the  signal to  noise ratio  increases.  One would 
suppose this to be  a reasonable expectation for visual orienting as well, although 
there is no convincing evidence of  it as yet. 

Twenty years after Bartlett first suggested that thought exhibits a “point of  no 
return”  we  seem  able to  make  a genuine  commitment to  an  exploration of  his 
insight.  Perhaps we have reached a point on this road where we will not wish to 
turn back. 

These experiments were supported by NSF Grant BNS 176-18907-A02 to the University 
of  Oregon.  I  am  grateful  to  Ray  Klein,  Gordon  Shulman,  John  McLean  and  Roger 
Remington for stimulating discussion of their experiments, which they have allowed me to 
cite.  Mary Jo Nissen was a very close collaborator in the conception and design of these 
experiments and aided substantially in the development of the ideas outlined here.
