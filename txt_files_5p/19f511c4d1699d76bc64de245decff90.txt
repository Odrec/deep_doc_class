Summary

Mental imagery has been proposed to contribute to a variety
of high-level cognitive functions, including memory encod-
ing and retrieval, navigation, spatial planning, and even
social communication and language comprehension [1–5].
However, it is debated whether mental imagery relies on
the same sensory representations as perception [1, 6–10],
and if so, what functional consequences such an overlap
might have on perception itself. We report novel evidence
that single instances of imagery can have a pronounced
facilitatory inﬂuence on subsequent conscious perception.
Either seeing or imagining a speciﬁc pattern could strongly
bias which of two competing stimuli reach awareness during
binocular rivalry. Effects of imagery and perception were
location and orientation speciﬁc, accumulated in strength
over time, and survived an intervening visual task lasting
several seconds prior to presentation of the rivalry display.
Interestingly, effects of imagery differed from those of fea-
ture-based attention. The results demonstrate that imagery,
in the absence of any incoming visual signals, leads to the
formation of a short-term sensory trace that can bias future
perception, suggesting a means by which high-level pro-
cesses that support imagination and memory retrieval may
shape low-level sensory representations.

Results

We devised a novel paradigm to isolate the phenomenal con-
tents of mental imagery by measuring its impact on subsequent
perception. The experiments capitalize on the bistable phe-
nomenon of binocular rivalry, in which conﬂicting visual pat-
terns, presented one to each eye, lead to competitive interac-
tions in the visual cortex such that only one monocular pattern
becomes exclusively dominant in perception [11, 12]. We
hypothesized that the impact of visual imagery on conscious
perception might be revealed under these bistable perceptual
conditions; speciﬁcally, imagery might alter the balance of com-
petitive visual interactions in favor of the imagined pattern.

The rivalry display consisted of a green vertical grating
shown to the left eye and a red horizontal grating shown to
the right eye. We adjusted the relative strength of the two stim-
uli to minimize any pre-existing eye bias an observer might
have (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures available

online). In Experiment 1, the rivalry display was brieﬂy shown
once every 10.75 s, and observers reported which of the two
patterns appeared dominant
after each presentation
(Figure 1A). Under conditions of passive viewing, observers
were more likely to perceive a given pattern if the same pattern
appeared dominant on the preceding trial (Figure 1B, gray bar).
This persistence of rivalry dominance across successive pre-
sentations (i.e., perceptual stabilization) is believed to reﬂect
the automatic formation of a sensory memory that can bias
subsequent perception in a facilitatory manner [13, 14]. Here,
the level of perceptual stabilization during passive viewing
was w80%, consistent with previous studies [13–16].

To investigate the effects of imagery, observers were in-
structed to imagine one of the two rivalry patterns during the
blank intervening period between presentations, either the
pattern that was dominant or the pattern that was suppressed
on the preceding rivalry presentation. Imagery of the previ-
ously dominant pattern led to somewhat higher levels of per-
ceptual stability relative to passive viewing (Figure 1B, white
bar), whereas imagery of the previously suppressed pattern
led to much lower levels of perceptual stability (Figure 1B,
black bar). Thus, imagery biased subsequent perception in
favor of the imagined pattern. These facilitatory effects were
reliable in individual observers (Figure S1). A control experi-
ment conﬁrmed that naive observers showed these imagery
effects only for rivalry displays and not for catch-trial presen-
tations of mock-rivalry displays (Figure S2). This suggests
that the facilitatory effects of imagery are perceptual in nature
and unlikely to reﬂect decisional bias.

In subsequent experiments, we investigated whether these
effects of imagery can be mimicked by viewing a faint pattern
(experiment 2), enhanced by longer periods of imagery (exper-
iment 3), impaired by the presence of a bright background (ex-
periment 4), and disrupted by changes in orientation or retino-
topic location (experiment 5). For experiments 2–4, observers
reported which pattern appeared dominant on each rivalry
presentation, after which they were shown or instructed to
imagine the pattern that had just been suppressed so that its
effect on the stability of subsequent rivalry could be deter-
mined. If perceptual stability fell signiﬁcantly below the level
found with passive viewing of a blank screen (w80%), this
indicated bias in favor of the previously suppressed pattern.
Experiment 5 used a different design; the viewed or imagined
pattern was randomly selected on each trial, and its impact on
subsequent rivalry perception was measured. Perceptual faci-
litation was indicated if the seen or imagined pattern appeared
dominant on the next rivalry presentation more often than 50%
of the time.

Weak Visual Stimulation Resembles the Effects of Imagery
In experiment 2, we investigated the consequences of pas-
sively viewing a single physical pattern between intermittent
rivalry presentations. Shortly after each rivalry presentation,
observers were shown the pattern they reported as sup-
pressed for a 4 s period (Figure 2A), and this pattern’s inﬂuence
on subsequent rivalry perception was measured. We hypothe-
sized that imagery might be mimicking the effects of weak
visual stimulation and therefore parametrically varied the

Figure 1. Effects of Mental Imagery on Subsequent
Perceptual Dominance in Rivalry
(A) Visual stimuli and timing of events. A rivalry
display was presented every 10.75 s, and ob-
servers reported which of the two rival patterns
appeared dominant. During the 10 s blank inter-
val following each presentation, observers were
instructed either to maintain ﬁxation passively
or to imagine the pattern that was dominant or
suppressed on the previous rivalry presentation.
(B) Results showing perceptual stability across
successive rivalry presentations (N = 7). Ob-
servers tended to perceive the same pattern
across successive presentations during passive
viewing (perceptual stability w 80%, chance level
50%). Imagery led to signiﬁcant changes in per-
ceptual stability (F = 21.3, p < 0.0005). Whereas
imagery of the previously dominant pattern led to somewhat higher levels of perceptual stability than passive viewing (t = 1.9; p = 0.10), imagery of the
previous suppressed pattern led to signiﬁcantly lower levels of perceptual stability (t = 4.5; p < 0.005). Error bars represent 61 SEM.

intensity of this intervening stimulus. Perceptual stability was
severely disrupted when the intervening pattern was shown
at fairly low luminance levels, corresponding to w40% of the
intensity of the rivalry stimuli (Figure 2B). Further decreases
in stimulus luminance led to weaker disruptive effects that
eventually reached the level found for passively viewing a blank
screen (i.e., 0% luminance). Similar results were obtained
for manipulations of stimulus contrast (Figures 2C and 2D),
indicating that prior viewing of either a low-luminance or low-
contrast pattern can facilitate subsequent perception of that
pattern during rivalry.

The facilitatory effects of weak visual stimulation cannot be
explained in terms of immediate sensory interactions [17],
given the 3 s gap between presentations of the intervening
pattern and the subsequent rivalry display. Moreover, these
facilitatory effects cannot be explained in terms of neural
adaptation or fatigue because prior adaptation to a strong
visual pattern is known to weaken both neural responses [18]
and subsequent dominance in binocular rivalry [17, 19, 20]. In-
stead, it seems that passive viewing of a weak physical pattern
leads to the formation of a speciﬁc perceptual trace, which can
facilitate perception of that same pattern at a later time during

rivalry. After strong visual stimulation, however, the beneﬁts of
this perceptual trace may be masked by counteracting effects
of neural adaptation. In the following experiments, we directly
compared imagery with passive viewing of faint visual patterns
(shown at 40% of the intensity of the rivalry pattern).

Facilitatory Effects of Imagery and Weak Stimulation
Accumulate over Time
To what extent does imagery resemble weak visual stimula-
tion, and might both lead to the formation of a short-term per-
ceptual trace? We reasoned that if these short-term facilitation
effects resulted from the formation of a physiological trace,
then the strength of that trace should increase with prolonged
durations of imagery or direct stimulation. Also, if the short-
term trace is truly sensory and not dependent on active main-
tenance [21], then once formed, this trace should persist for
brief periods even when the observer must attend to another
visual task.

Experiment 3 had the following design: After each rivalry
presentation, observers viewed or imagined the previously
suppressed pattern for a variable duration of 1–15 s (Figure 3A).
Next
they performed a challenging discrimination task,

Figure 2. Effects of Weak Visual Stimuli on Subsequent
Dominance in Rivalry
(A) Rivalry displays were presented every 10.75 s. An intervening
stimulus was presented for a 4 s period between rivalry presen-
tations, consisting of the oriented pattern that was suppressed
on the previous rivalry presentation. Luminance of the interven-
ing stimulus was varied across blocks of trials.

plotted as a function of the luminance of the intervening stimulus
(N = 5). The intervening stimulus was most effective at disrupting
perceptual stability at modest luminance levels, corresponding
to w40% of the mean luminance of the rivalry patterns. Note
that lower levels of perceptual stability indicate that rivalry
dominance is biased in favor of the intervening pattern.

Longer periods of viewing the physical pattern led to lower
levels of perceptual stability (Figure 3B, perception condition),
indicating enhanced facilitation and a build-up in the strength

(Control experiments
revealed no change in perceptual stability when observers
passively viewed a blank screen for variable durations.) Longer
periods of imagery also led to stronger facilitatory effects
(Figure 3B, dotted line), and remarkably, these effects were
comparable in strength to those obtained by viewing the phys-
ical pattern. The results imply that prolonged mental imagery
leads to the gradual accumulation of a perceptual trace,
much like the effect of weak perception. After this trace is
formed, it can persist for short periods while the observer is
actively engaged in another visual task.

Figure 3. Effects of Task Duration for Perception, Imagery, and
Attention
(A) Experimental design. After each rivalry presentation,
observers viewed,
imagined, or attended to the previously
suppressed rivalry pattern for a variable duration (1–15 s), then
performed a challenging letter-discrimination task.
(B) Perceptual stability across successive rivalry presentations,
plotted as a function of task duration (N = 5). Disruptive effects
of perception and imagery signiﬁcantly increased over time, as in-
dicated by repeated-measures ANOVA (F = 9.8, p < 0.001), with no
reliable difference found between these two conditions (main ef-
fect, F = 3.4, p = 0.138; task 3 duration interaction, F = 1.4, p =
0.30). By contrast, feature-based attention strongly disrupted
perceptual stability after just 1 s of viewing the plaid stimulus
and did not change in strength as a function of task duration
(F = 0.03, p = 0.99). Effects of feature-based attention over time dif-
fered from those of imagery and perception, as indicated by a sig-
niﬁcant interaction effect (F = 2.77, p < 0.05). In the blank passive
condition (gray circles), each rivalry presentation was followed by
passive viewing of a blank screen for 1 or 15 s and then the
letter-discrimination task. Perceptual stability was unaffected
by varying the duration of passive viewing of a blank screen. Plots
show linear ﬁts to the data. Errors bars represent 61 SEM.

We also explored whether manipulations of background
luminance might reveal differences between the top-down
effects of imagery and attention. In early pilot studies, some
observers reported difﬁculty with forming a vivid mental image
while viewing a lit background, so we switched to a dark back-
ground instead. In experiment 4, however, we purposely ma-
nipulated the luminance of the background while subjects
performed the imagery or feature-based attention task. Back-
ground luminance was set to 0, 25, 50, or 100% of the mean
luminance of the rivalry patterns on separate blocks of trials.
Feature-based attention could strongly disrupt perceptual
stability at all luminance levels, with no reliable difference be-
tween conditions (Figure 4). By contrast, imagery became less
effective at disrupting rivalry at higher luminance levels, such
that perceptual stability in the 100% luminance condition
was no different from control conditions of passive viewing
(t = 0.34; p = 0.76). Given that subjects attempted to perform
the same imagery task across variations in background

Differential Effects of Imagery and Feature-Based Attention
In experiment 3, we also tested for facilitatory effects of
feature-based attention, which has been found to modulate
rivalry perception to some extent [22–25]. By feature-based
attention, we refer to the ability to attend selectively to one
of multiple overlapping features occupying a common region
of space. Between rivalry presentations, the physical sum of
both rivalry patterns was presented to both eyes as a stable
composite plaid (see Figure 3A, bottom), and observers were
instructed to attend to one of the patterns. An initial experi-
ment revealed facilitatory effects of attention (Figure S3)
similar to the imagery effects found in experiment 1.

For experiment 3, the plaid stimulus was presented for
1–15 s, and the letter-discrimination task and the subsequent
rivalry display followed. Facilitatory effects of feature-based
attention emerged in full strength after just 1 s of performing
this task (Figure 3B), unlike the gradual build-up found for im-
agery and weak visual stimulation. This difference in the time
needed for attention to bias rivalry indicates that the effects
of imagery can be distinguished from those of feature-based
attention.

Figure 4. Inﬂuence of Background Luminance on Disruptive Effects
of Imagery and Feature-Based Attention
Observers either imagined or attended to the pattern that was suppressed
on the previous rivalry presentation (N = 4), and the luminance of the back-
ground varied across different blocks of trials. Bias effects of imagery were
disrupted at higher luminance levels (F = 5.2, p < 0.05) and thereby signiﬁ-
cantly differed from bias effects of feature-based attention (ANOVA interac-
tion effect, F = 5.55, p < 0.05; effect of condition F = 16.8, p < 0.05). In com-
parison, perceptual stability of rivalry remained high when observers
passively viewed a blank screen (ﬁlled circles) or a plaid stimulus (ﬁlled
triangles) between rivalry presentations, independent of background lumi-
nance level. Thus, variations in luminance level alone do not affect the
stability of rivalry perception. Error bars represent 6SEM.

Figure 5. Orientation-Speciﬁc Bias of Rivalry Perception
(A) Experimental design and stimuli. In the imagery condition, ob-
servers were randomly cued to imagine either a vertical green or
a horizontal red grating, and then two orthogonal rivaling patterns
were presented 7 s later. On each trial, the rivalry display was rotated
by 245, 222.5, 0, +22.5, or +45. Both patterns were always ro-
tated the same amount, thereby maintaining orthogonality. In the
perception condition, either a vertical green grating or a horizontal
red grating was shown for 4 s, a 3 s delay followed, and then the
rivalry display was shown at one of the 5 possible angles.
(B) Rivalry dominance was most strongly biased in favor of the
previously seen or imagined pattern for rivalry displays sharing
the same orientation (N = 5, data sorted by angular difference
between cued grating and rivalry test pattern). Analysis of
variance revealed reliable effects of orientation bias for imagery
(F = 4.4, p < 0.05) and perception (F = 6.2, p < 0.005), with no
statistical difference between these conditions (p = 0.66). Error
bars represent 61 SEM.

luminance, such interference by a uniformly lit background im-
plies that these bias effects are attributable to imagery per se,
rather than other aspects of the task instructions.

Orientation Speciﬁcity of Imagery
Finally, we investigated the visual speciﬁcity of imagery by
probing the effects of orientation, a property that is strongly
represented in early visual areas [26, 27]. We hypothesized
that if mental imagery can activate orientation-selective neu-
rons and lead to the formation of an orientation-selective
trace, then subsequent perception should be facilitated only
when the imagined orientation closely matches the physical
orientation of one of the rivaling patterns.

Experiment 5 introduced a randomized-trial design. On each
trial, the grating to be seen or imagined was randomly deter-
mined and its inﬂuence on subsequent rivalry dominance
was measured (Figure 5A). For the imagery task, a randomized
cue indicated whether to imagine the green vertical grating or
red horizontal grating for 4 s. In the perception condition, an
actual grating was presented in place of the imagery task.
Next, orthogonal rivalry patterns were presented, both rotated
by 245, 222.5, 0, +22.5, or +45 on any given trial. If rivalry
perception was biased in favor of the previously seen or imag-
ined pattern on more than 50% of the trials, this indicated
a perceptual facilitation effect.

Analysis of individual trials revealed orientation-dependent
effects of mental imagery (Figure 5B), with the strongest per-
ceptual facilitation found for matching orientations (average
bias 74%, chance level 50%) and progressively weaker effects
found for differing orientations. Perception of an intervening
physical pattern led to the same orientation-dependent
pattern of results.

A further experiment conﬁrmed that facilitatory effects of im-
agery were speciﬁc to retinotopic location. Observers showed
strong facilitation when imagery was performed at the same
location as the subsequent rivalry patterns but no facilitation
when locations differed (Figure S4). (Similar location-speciﬁc
effects were observed for feature-based attention, indicating
local rather than global facilitation of the attended feature
[28].) Taken together, the results suggest that imagery leads
to the formation of a precise sensory trace that is speciﬁc to
both orientation and retinotopic location.

Discussion

This study demonstrates that single episodes of mental
imagery can have a powerful functional impact on the outcome
of conscious perception. Both imagery and perception led to
the formation of a visually speciﬁc short-term trace that could
bias subsequent perception of ambiguous stimuli in a precise
manner. These ﬁndings are important because they suggest
a potential mechanism by which top-down expectations or
recollections of previous experiences might shape perception
itself.

Our ﬁndings provide strong support for perceptually based
theories of imagery [1]. Evidence is mixed regarding whether
mental images can provide a veridical representation of stimuli
after their removal [29–31]. Studies in favor of the perceptual
nature of imagery have found that the active maintenance
of mental
images can sometimes interfere with perception
[32–34] or facilitate perception in a stimulus-speciﬁc manner
[35, 36]. Because imagery and perception tasks were per-
formed concurrently in previous studies, a potential concern
is that the imagery task might alter how subjects attend to
the test stimulus. If so, then perceptual effects observed dur-
ing mental imagery might reﬂect the byproduct of interactions
between attention and incoming sensory signals [6, 35–38].
Our study addressed these concerns by separating imagery
and perception tasks in time, thereby allowing subjects to per-
form imagery in the absence of any incoming sensory signals.
In addition, we found novel evidence suggesting that the
effects of feature-based attention can be distinguished from
those of imagery.

This study also reveals how different forms of top-down in-
ﬂuence can alter the balance of perceptual competition during
rivalry [11, 12]. Binocular rivalry is strongly inﬂuenced by the
low-level stimulus manipulations [39] but can also be biased
by feature-based attention [22–25]. Here, we found novel evi-
dence that top-down effects of mental imagery can bias per-
ceptual competition in rivalry, suggesting that endogenously
generated activity may also have a role in resolving perceptual
ambiguity.

What type of memory might support these perceptual facil-
itation effects? Longer periods of imagery or perception led to
stronger facilitation effects, which could survive for several

Current Biology Vol 18 No 13

seconds while subjects performed another visual task. Thus,
the duration of this perceptual trace extends well beyond
that of iconic memory, which lasts only a few hundred millisec-
onds [40]. The graded and automatic nature of this memory
also differs from traditional descriptions of working memory,
which involves all-or-none encoding of discrete items and their
active maintenance to prevent memory decay [21]. Instead,
this short-term perceptual facilitation resembles the effects
of perceptual priming [41], which can be quite speciﬁc to
the features and location of a previously seen stimulus
[17, 42–44]. It is striking to consider that ‘‘perceptual priming’’
might be elicited without perception, by simply imagining
a previous perceptual experience.
