Base Rate Fallacy

A cab was involved in a hit and run accident at night. Two
cab companies, the Green and the Blue, operate in the city.
You are given the following data:

(cid:73) 85% of the cabs in the city are Green and 15% are Blue
(cid:73) a witness identiﬁed the cab as Blue.

The court tested the reliability of the witness under the same
circumstances that existed on the night of the accident and
concluded that the witness correctly identiﬁed each one of the
two colors 80% of the time and failed 20% of the time. What
is the probability that the cab involved in the accident was
Blue rather than Green?

Kinds of Problems

(cid:73) Well-deﬁned1

(cid:73) What is 57 times 176?
(cid:73) How do I get to room 31/449a?
(cid:73) How do I beat my classmate at tic-tac-toe?

(cid:73) Ill-deﬁned2

(cid:73) How do I lead a happy life?
(cid:73) How do I ﬁnd the perfect mate?
(cid:73) How do I become rich and famous?

Cryptarithmetic

D O N A L D D=5

+ G E R A L D
R O B E R T

[Newell and Simon, 1972, chapter 6]

Verbal Protocol

[Newell and Simon, 1972, chapter 6]

Verbal Protocol

D O N A L D D=5

+ G E R A L D
R O B E R T

(cid:73) B1: Each letter has one and only one numerical value...
(cid:73) B5: Therefore, I can, looking at the two D’s...
(cid:73) B6: Each D is 5;
(cid:73) B7: therefore, T is zero.
(cid:73) B10: Now, do I have any other T’s?
(cid:73) B11: No.
(cid:73) B12: But I have another D.
(cid:73) ...

[Newell and Simon, 1972, chapter 6]

Problem Behavior Graph

(cid:73) Each box represents a state of knowledge, e.g. at box 3 S

has ﬁnished processing column 1 (D+D=T) and knows
that T=0 (B7) and states B8

(cid:73) The labeled lines between the boxes are operations that

change states, e.g. after processing column 1 S now
knows that T=0

(cid:73) S sometimes goes back to a previous state

Results of Verbal Protocol Analysis

(cid:73) Thinking cannot be observed directly
(cid:73) But we can ask Ss to think aloud while they solve a

problem

(cid:73) Analyzing verbal protocols is hard work
(cid:73) In 20 minutes protocol S only used a small number of

operations, e.g. generate possible values for each letter,
hypothetically assign a number and see whether it leads
to a contradiction, etc.

(cid:73) There is backtracking (going back to a previous state of

knowledge)

(cid:73) There is forgetting and rechecking
(cid:73) How does S choose which operation to try next?

Tower of Hanoi

[Mayer, 1992, p. 72]

Problem Space

[Mayer, 1992, p. 182]

Problem Space

(cid:73) The problem space is a

complete enumeration of all
states and the ways you can
move between states

(cid:73) Start in initial state (1)
(cid:73) Get to goal state (8)
(cid:73) You need to choose a
sequence of operations

(cid:73) Problem solving as search in

problem space

[Mayer, 1992, p. 182]

Random Search

(cid:73) How do you ﬁnd the goal state?
(cid:73) Idea: Trial-and-error
(cid:73) You randomly try operators and see where they get you
(cid:73) Bad idea! Problem spaces can be really big and you’ll

never ﬁnd the right solution by chance...

(cid:73) ... although people may resort to trial and error when

they fail to do something smarter

Greedy Search

(cid:73) Idea: For each state get an evaluation for how far away it

is from the goal and only make moves that bring you
closer to the goal

(cid:73) Example: Count disks on peg 3
(cid:73) Problem 1: Sometimes you need to make moves that take

you away from the goal in order to get there

(cid:73) Problem 2: Where does the evaluation function come

from?

Means-Ends Analysis

(cid:73) Idea: Work backwards
(cid:73) What do I need to do to achieve my goal? Is there a
barrier? Create a subgoal to remove that barrier ﬁrst.
Recurse.

(cid:73) Goal: Get large disk (3) to right peg (C)
(cid:73) Barrier: Medium disk (2) is on top of large disk (3)
(cid:73) Subgoal: Get medium disk (2) to middle peg (3)
(cid:73) Barrier: Small disk (1) is on top of medium disk (2)

(cid:73) Subsubgoal: Get small (1) disk to right peg (3)
(cid:73) Easy, I can do that

(cid:73) Now I can also move the medium disk

[Mayer, 1992, p. 195]

Production System for Tower of Hanoi

[Mayer, 1992, p. 195ﬀ]

Production System for Tower of Hanoi

[Mayer, 1992, p. 197f]

Production Systems

(cid:73) Represent goals and other information in working memory
(cid:73) Productions are rules for action that “ﬁre” depending on
the state of working memory and the state of the world

(cid:73) They take the form: IF precondition THEN action
(cid:73) Productions may compete with each other if several

productions could ﬁre

(cid:73) Productions are possible actions and not instructions
(cid:73) Productions and their relative importance are learned
(cid:73) Productions can be seen as cognitivist elaborations of

classical stimulus-response relationships

Problem Solving as Search

(cid:73) A well-deﬁned problem has

(cid:73) a problem space with states
(cid:73) operations that move you from one state to another
(cid:73) an initial state
(cid:73) a goal state

(cid:73) States include states of the world (I want all disks on peg
3) and states of knowledge (I want to know the values for
all letters)

(cid:73) The task is to ﬁnd a path from the initial state to the

goal state

(cid:73) Hence, trying to solve a problem is searching in problem

space

(cid:73) Examples for search strategies are: Random, greedy,

means-ends

Insight Problems

(cid:73) Some problems seem well-deﬁned and you think you have

an idea about what the problem space is and what the
operators are

(cid:73) But you’re still stuck—you encounter an impasse
(cid:73) The insight is what happens at the “aha” moment
(cid:73) If we view problem solving as search we can often think
about insight as rerepresenting the problem, i.e. using a
diﬀerent problem space or diﬀerent operators

Four Chains

A man had four chains, each three links long. He wanted to
join the four chains into a single, closed chain. Having a link
opened cost 2 cents and having a link closed cost 3 cents. The
man had his chains joined into a closed chain for 15 cents.
How did he do it?

[Bransford and Stein, 1984, p. 17]

Mutilated Checkerboard

[Kaplan and Simon, 1990]

Representation Matters

(cid:73) “A graduate student in Chemical Engineering spent 18
hours and ﬁlled 61 pages of a lab notebook with notes,
yet still did not solve the problem!“

(cid:73) “In other pilot research with the MC problem, none of our

subjects was able to solve the problem within an hour
without being given one or more hints. Again, subjects
switched from searching in the initial covering problem
space to a meta-level space of potential new
representations.”

(cid:73) “Most of their time was spent either fruitlessly trying

various coverings or searching for new approaches to the
problem. When subjects ﬁnally paid attention to the
parity of the squares, many experienced a sudden insight
leading to the problem’s solution.”

[Kaplan and Simon, 1990]

Some Problem Spaces Used by Subjects

(cid:73) Covering spaces

(cid:73) Try placing all dominos horizontally.
(cid:73) Try placing all dominos vertically.
(cid:73) Try placing dominos in a spiral pattern.
(cid:73) Try placing dominos in a zig-zag pattern.
(cid:73) Try decomposing board into smaller areas, and cover

each area.

(cid:73) Mathematical spaces

(cid:73) Consider whether a path between the mutilated squares

contains an even or odd number of squares.

(cid:73) Create mathematical expressions describing the

quantities of dominos or squares.

(cid:73) ...
(cid:73) Parity space (the right one)

(cid:73) Consider how color might help solve the problem.

[Kaplan and Simon, 1990]

Search Times By Problem Spaces

Time spent after ﬁrst mention of parity, before rough proof

Time spent in:
Experimenter hints/comments
Covering spaces
Other nonparity spaces
Parity space
Total

Mean % time spent
1.96
5.92
7.24
4.88
20.00

(cid:73) Diﬃculty stems from fruitless search in the wrong
problem spaces (even after ﬁrst mention of parity)

[Kaplan and Simon, 1990]

Radiation Problem

A more ill-deﬁned (i.e, realistic) problem:
“Suppose you are a doctor faced with a patient who has a
malignant tumor in his stomach. It is impossible to operate on
the patient, but unless the tumor is destroyed the patient will
die. There is a kind of ray that can be used to destroy the
tumor. If the rays reach the tumor all at once at a suﬃciently
high intensity, the tumor will be destroyed. Unfortunately, at
this intensity the healthy tissue that the rays pass through on
the way to the tumor will also be destroyed. At lower
intensities the rays are harmless to healthy tissue, but they will
not aﬀect the tumor either. What type of procedure might be
used to destroy the tumor with rays, and at the same time
avoid destroying the healthy tissue?”

[Duncker, 1945, Gick and Holyoak, 1980]

Solution Proposals

(cid:73) Solution proposals can be classiﬁed by their functional

value or means-by-which

(cid:73) Functional aspects often precede concrete and speciﬁc

proposals (means-ends analysis)

(cid:73) Each solution class corresponds to a reformulation of the

problem (rerepresentation)

[Duncker, 1945, p. 5]

Candles

“On the door, at the height of the eyes, three small candles are
to be put side by side.”

(cid:73) If the boxes were used to hold the candles, tacks, and

matches, i.e. the boxes were used as containers, Ss found
it harder to imagine another function for the boxes

(cid:73) Not being able to overcome this mental block is called

functional ﬁxedness

(cid:73) A similar pattern was seen for several other problems
where the decisive object was either already used in a
speciﬁc way or not

[Duncker, 1945, p. 88]

Analogies

(cid:73) Where do problem spaces, problem reformulations, ideas

come from?

(cid:73) One idea: Analogical transfer, retrieve a (similar) problem

that has been solved before from memory and map the
solution to the new problem

(cid:73) Clearly, analogies play a big role in science and teaching
(e.g., atom is like solar system, electricity is like water,
etc.)

Analogies

“A small country fell under the iron rule of a dictator. The dictator ruled
the country from a strong fortress. The fortress was situated in the
middle of the country, surrounded by farms and villages. Many roads
radiated outward from the fortress like spokes on a wheel. A great
general arose who raised a large army at the border and vowed to capture
the fortress and free the country of the dictator. The general knew that if
his entire army could attack the fortress at once it could be captured. His
troops were poised at the head of one of the roads leading to the fortress,
ready to attack. However, a spy brought the general a disturbing report.
The ruthless dictator had planted mines on each of the roads. The mines
were set so that small bodies of men could pass over them safely, since
the dictator needed to be able to move troops and workers to and from
the fortress. However, any large force would detonate the mines. Not
only would this blow up the road and render it impassable, but the
dictator would then destroy many villages in retaliation. A full-scale
direct attack on the fortress therefore appeared impossible.”

[Gick and Holyoak, 1980]

Summary

(cid:73) Problem solving can be seen as search in a problem space
(cid:73) Examples for search strategies are: Random, greedy and

means-ends

(cid:73) Production systems are used to model problem solving

(and other cognitive processes)

(cid:73) We do not understand insight very well
(cid:73) Finding the right problem representation is key to solving

a problem

(cid:73) Functional ﬁxedness is an example for a typical block in

problem solving

(cid:73) Analogies are a source for problem solutions
(cid:73) The cognitive science of problem solving is of great

practical importance

Recommended Thinking

(cid:73) Solve the DONALD+ROBERT cryptarithmetic puzzle and think aloud while
you do this. For the aﬁcionados: If you recorded what you said (perhaps even
recorded on video what you scribbled down) you could try to build the complete
problem behavior graph afterwards.

(cid:73) Can you trust verbal protocols as accurate reﬂections of thinking? What are
problems? Can they be overcome? Are there better ways to ﬁnd out what’s
happening in the head?

(cid:73) What is the diﬀerence between thinking aloud and introspection? (Go back to

many of the problems given on the next slides as you like. Not all problems will
be accompanied by an “aha” experience. Sometimes you’ll be able to solve
these problems by routine methods. In either case, think aloud while you try to
solve the problems. For which problems can you say what the problem space,
the initial state, the goal state and the operators are? Pay attention to how you
search (for) the problem space? What’s your search strategy? What do you do
when you get stuck? What is the insight that you needed to solve the problem
and when and how did you get it? If you recorded your thinking aloud, listen to
the recording. How often did you get close to the solution without having an
insight?

(cid:73) Will, one day, AI be able solve insight problems?

More Problems

(cid:73) Two train stations are 50 miles apart. At 1 P.M. on Sunday a train pulls out

from each of the stations and the trains start towards one another. Just as the
trains pull out from the stations a hawk ﬂies into the air in front of the ﬁrst
train and ﬂies ahead to the front of the second train. When the hawk reaches
the second train, it turns around and ﬂies toward the ﬁrst train. The hawk
continues in this way until the trains meet. Assume that both trains travel at
the speed of 25 miles per hour and that the hawk ﬂies at a constant speed of
100 miles per hour. How many miles will the hawk have ﬂown when the trains
meet? [Bransford and Stein, 1984, p. 6]

(cid:73) What day follows the day before yesterday if 2 days from now will be Sunday?

[Bransford and Stein, 1984, p. 18]

(cid:73) One morning, exactly at sunrise, a Buddhist monk began to climb a tall

mountain. The narrow path, no more than a foot or two wide, spiraled around
the mountain to a glittering temple at the summit. The monk ascended the
path at varying rates of speed, stopping many times along the way to rest and
to eat the dried fruit he carried with him. He reached the temple shortly before
sunset. After several days of fasting and meditation, he began his journey back
along the same path, starting at sunrise and again walking at variable speeds
with many pauses along the way. His average speed descending was, of course,
greater than his average climbing speed. Is there a spot along the path that the
monk will occupy on both trips at precisely the same time of day?
[Bransford and Stein, 1984, p. 29]

More Problems

(cid:73) There are 12 cannonballs. All look alike, but one is the “oddball.” The oddball
is either heavier or lighter than the other balls. You are supplied with a balance
scale that can hold as many cannonballs as you would like on each side of the
scale. The problem is, in 4 weighings (4 uses of the scale), ﬁnd the oddball.
[Bransford and Stein, 1984, p. 21]

(cid:73) There are two large jars. One jar is ﬁlled with a large number of blue beads and
the other is ﬁlled with the same number of red beads. Five beads from the red
bead jar are scooped out and dumped in the blue bead jar. Someone then puts
a hand in the blue bead jar and scoops out ﬁve beads without knowing what
color they are and dumps them into the read bead jar. Are there the same
number of red beads in the red bead jar as there are blue beads in the blue
bead jar? [Bransford and Stein, 1984, p. 29]

(cid:73) Assume that a man has 25 cigar butts and that he uses 5 butts to make a new
cigar (he rerolls the butts). How many cigars can he smoke after he has made

pockets so distributed that each pocket contains a diﬀerent number of dollars.
Can he do so? [Polya, 1957, p. 234]

More Problems

(cid:73) A bear, starting from the point P, walked one mile due south. Then he changed

direction and walked one mile due east. Then he turned again to the left and
walked one mile due north, and arrived exactly at the point P he started from.
What was the color of the bear? [Polya, 1957, p. 234]

(cid:73) A man bought a horse for $60 and sold it for $70. Then he bought it back

again for $80 and sold it for $90. How much did he make in the horse business?
[Mayer, 1992, p. 69]

(cid:73) You have three jugs, which we will call A, B and C. Jug A can hold exactly 8
cups of water, B can hold exactly 5 cups, and C can hold exactly 3 cups. A is
ﬁlled to capacity with exactly 8 cups of water. B and C are empty. We want to
ﬁnd a way of dividing the contents of A equally between A and B so that both
have 4 cups. You are allowed to pour water from jug to jug. [Mayer, 1992, p.
55, 186]

(cid:73) A man dies and leaves an estate, including 17 horses, to his three sons.
According to his will, everything is to be divided among his three sons as
follows: 1/2 to the oldest son, 1/3 to the middle son, and 1/9th to the
youngest son. The three sons are puzzled over how to apply these instructions
to divide the 17 horses. A probate lawyer rides by on his horse. He says, “I’ll
donate my horse to you”. Then he proceeds to divide the horses among the
three sons: 1/2 of 18 is 9, 1/3 of 18 is 6, 1/9 of 18 is 2. That’s 17 horses. The
lawyer rides away with his own horse and a nice commission. How did the
probate lawyer solve their problem? [Batchelder and Alexander, 2012]

More Problems

(cid:73) You have ten volumes of an encyclopedia numbered 1,...,10 shelved on a

bookcase. Each volume has 100 pages. To simplify matters, assume that the
front cover of each volume is page 1 and the back cover is page 100. You go to
sleep, and in the middle of the night a bookworm crawls onto the bookcase.
The bookworm eats through the ﬁrst page of the ﬁrst volume and continues
onwards, stopping after eating through the last page of the tenth volume. How
many pieces of paper did the bookworm eat through?
[Batchelder and Alexander, 2012]

(cid:73) You are driving up and then down a mountain that is twenty miles up and

twenty miles down. You average 30 miles per hour for the ﬁrst 20 miles. How
fast would you need to go for the remaining twenty miles to average 60 miles
per hour for the entire trip? [Batchelder and Alexander, 2012]

(cid:73) Three friends traveling together walk into a hotel and ask for a room. The

manager tells them that the available room costs $30. Each pays $10, and then
they go up to the room. Afterwards, the manager realizes he overcharged for
the room and sends $5 back with the Bell Hop. On the way to the room, the
Bell Hop realizes that these people are not expecting to get any money back.
He decides to pocket $2 of the overcharge and gives the people in the room $3
back. If the three travelers initially paid $10 each, and each got $1 back, then
they each paid $9 for the room. $9 x 3 = $27. Adding to that the $2 the Bell
Hop kept for himself brings the total amount paid for the room to $29. What
happened to the 30th dollar? [Batchelder and Alexander, 2012]

Recommended Reading

The IDEAL problem solver [Bransford and Stein, 1984] is a very good “self-help” book
on problem solving that strikes the right balance between making recommendations
and pointing you to the cognitive science behind the recommendations. It also touches
on memory. If you want to see what kind of recommendations you can expect from
cognitive scientists for improving thinking, this will still be as good as it gets. How to
Solve Problems [Wickelgren, 1974] is harder to work through but guides you more
explicitly through concrete (search) strategies that you (or AI programs) can use for
math and science homework questions. A real classic with an emphasis on
mathematical problem solving is How to Solve It [Polya, 1957]. This book is based on
the intuitions of a great mathematician and his experience with teaching. It did,
however, have considerable inﬂuence on cognitive scientists, too. A good textbook for
getting started with actual cognitive science of problem solving is Thinking, Problem
Solving, Cognition [Mayer, 1992]. If you wanted to dive in deeper, I would recommend
looking at Human Problem Solving [Newell and Simon, 1972]. This book has a
reputation of being long and diﬃcult but you can get the gist without working through
all the details they provide. It is certainly one of the most inﬂuential books in all of
cognitive science. The historical appendix is particularly interesting for the beginner, I
think. Search will be a major focus in your AI class and there you will also hear more
about production systems. If you’re curious or skeptical about the role of verbal
reports and introspection check out the debate between [Nisbett and Wilson, 1977]
and [Ericsson and Simon, 1980] that I already mentioned during the second week in
the lecture on folk psychology.
