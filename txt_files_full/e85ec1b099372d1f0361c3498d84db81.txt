Common Mistakes/Remarks

task 1 semantic equivalence means biconditional and truth
table and evaluation of the biconditional in the truthtable
2.2 ”if Barney is old and disgruntled” → 2 sentences in Lprop
let’s also take a look at the whole formula here
”If Barney is old and disgruntled, he is unlikely to play Bingo
unless the magistrate oﬀers a big prize.”
becomes: A ∧ B → (¬D → ¬C )
2.3 ”If Barack is the president and his aide is found guilty of
lying to investigators, then if Barack doesnt distance himself
from his aide, Barack will be in trouble.”
”A ∧ B → (¬C → D)” vs ”A ∧ B ∧ ¬C → D)”
3.2 ”he dances just in case Keith plays” → biconditional
(Have a look at the ’cheat sheet’ for translations! There are
some great rules of thumb )
would you like to go through the old homework in more detail?

Quick Recap

What you should know

equivalence of sentences? → biconditional
validity of arguments? → inference conditional
→ identify if tautology/contradiction/contingent
means to identify a tautology (so far): truth table
but: ineﬃcient method (2n rows for all assignments)

Lecture 3

Important New Stuﬀ

models + countermodels

semantic tree method + reduction rules

interdeﬁnability + transformation rules

expressiveness/completeness of our connectives

Lecture 3

Models + Countermodels

deﬁnition: model of φ = assignment that satisﬁes φ

countermodel of φ = assignment that does not satisfy φ

are these terms clear? what does this mean for
tautologies/contradictions?

Lecture 3

Semantic Tree Method

graphical model to systematically look for models of a formula

apply reduction rules to formulas (”what must be true for φ
to be true?”)

reduce formulas until: (negated) sentence letters

Lecture 3

Reduction Rules

we’ll just derive them ourselves (so you don’t have to learn
them by heart)

(DN) Double Negation

(C) Conjunction

(NC) Negated Conjunction

(D) Disjunction

(ND) Negated Disjunction

Lecture 3

Reduction Rules

(I) Implication

(NI) Negated Implication

(B) Biconditional

(NB) Negated Biconditional

Lecture 3

Semantic Tree Method

every fully reduced branch without a contradiction = a model

but: only bc a formula has models, it’s not a tautology

we kind of only care about tautologies at this point though

solution: take the negation of a formula

if it has NO models, our original formula is a tautology

look for contradictory truth conditions

time for some practice

Lecture 3

Interdeﬁnability

completely diﬀerent stuﬀ but still pretty important
Lprop connectives are interdeﬁnable
→ we can specify the meaning of any sentential connective in
terms of combinations of other sentential connectives
the full set of Lprop connectives is expressively complete
and certain subsets are expressively complete as well!
namely [¬,∧] and [¬,∨]
13 transformation rules in total (let’s take a look)

we can convert any formula into a semantically equivalent
formula that only contains [¬,∧] or only [¬,∨] (eliminating
double negation is optional)

Remarks
This week

Lecture 3

Expressiveness

using Lprop connectives we can express all possible monadic
and dyadic truth functions

of course this means the subsets can do this as well!

you’ll see that they can actually express all truth functions
which is pretty nice for a simple language like Lprop
