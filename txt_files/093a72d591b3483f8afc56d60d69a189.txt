1. Introduction 

During the seminar “Testing For Language Teachers” every group had to design vari-
ous  tests  for  different  competences  (e.g.  speaking,  listening,  lexico-grammar,  lan-
guage  awareness,  testing  for  young  learners  and  reading)  and  school  levels.  Our 
tests intend to measure the reading ability for students of secondary schools level II. 
 
The following paper is subdivided into the chapters: General information, Mul-
tiple-Choice, Test design and the Conclusion. In the beginning we sum up the infor-
mation about reading ability and the requirements for the test takers. Later on, the 
method of a multiple choice test is described, followed by the advantages and disad-
vantages of this testing method. After that the test design is explained, focusing on 
individual questions, distractors and specific demands. Closing up with problems, we 
explain what occurred to be the most difficult part of the test construction.
