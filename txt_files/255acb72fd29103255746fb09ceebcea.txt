Introduction to EPR, Part 2 

  The Electron Spin 

  The Electron Spin in a Magnetic Field: The Concept of Magnetic Resonance 

  The Resonance Condition 

 The g-Factor    

 Interaction of the Electron Spin with Nuclear Spins: Hyperfine Interaction 

  Interaction between two Electron Spins 

  Some more aspects... 

  EPR @ Different Microwave Frequencies 

An Introduction to EPR Spectroscopy 

We can explain our first EPR spectrum ! 

  The Resonance Condition 

n  9.5 GHz (X band) 

hn = g b B  
hn = g b B  

In  most  EPR  machines  the  1st 
derivative  of 
absorption 
spectrum is recorded !

the 

DPPH (Diphenylpikrylhydrazyl) 
A common standard for field calibration in EPR →  g = 2.0036+/-0.0002
