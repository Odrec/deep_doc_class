Summary

OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that as a minority with lower socio-economic status, Turkish residents in
Germany might experience a higher mortality than Germans.
METHODS All-cause mortality rates by age group and sex of Turkish and German adults for the time period
1980–94 were calculated from death registry data and mid-year population estimates.
RESULTS The age-adjusted mortality rate (per 100000) of Turkish males aged 25–65 years resident in
Germany was 299 in 1980 and 247 in 1990, consistently half that of German males. The mortality of Turkish
females in Germany was 140 in 1990, half that of German females. Mortality of Turkish males/females in
Ankara was 835 and 426 in 1990.
CONCLUSION In view of the socio-economic status of Turkish residents in Germany the large mortality
difference compared to Germans is unexpected. It cannot be fully explained by a selection at the time of
hiring (healthy migrant effect) because it lasts over decades and extends into the second generation. A
healthy worker effect is unlikely because Turkish residents have a lower employment rate than Germans.
There is little evidence for movement of gravely ill persons back to Turkey. An ‘unhealthy re-migration effect’
in which socially successful migrants with a lower mortality risk stay in the host country while less successful
ones return home even before becoming manifestly ill would partly explain our ﬁndings.

Introduction

Migration within Europe is an on-going social phenomenon
of large scale. It affects the health of individual migrants as
well as that of populations (Bollini & Siem 1995; Elkeles &
Seifert 1996). Since the 1950s, millions of people have
temporarily migrated to Germany looking for work. About
900 000 people came from Turkey between 1963 and 1973.
Many of these Gastarbeiter (guestworkers) settled and
brought their families. They were joined by asylum seekers
from Turkey. Turkish nationals now form the largest foreign

nationality group in Germany. Their number increased from
1.5 to 2 million between 1980 and 1994 (Statistisches
Bundesamt 1996), with a brief decrease in 1985 after ﬁnancial
incentives for re-migration were offered by the German
Government.

People who migrate, whether their move is temporary or

permanent, are on average healthier than the population they
originate from, and often also healthier than the population
of their host country (Swerdlow 1991; Williams 1993; Parkin
1993). This ‘healthy migrant effect’ is due to a self-selection
process: the chronically ill and disabled are less likely to
migrate. Among migrants there are also particularly
courageous, innovative and socially skilled individuals
(Schiffauer 1991).

O. Razum et al. Mortality of  Turkish residents in Germany

Once they have moved to their host country, however,

migrant workers are often a minority with lower social status
than the host population. Numerous studies show that low
socio-economic position and minority status are associated
with chronic stress (Collatz 1994), higher morbidity (Marmot
et al. 1991; Bollini & Siem 1995; Elkeles & Seifert 1996) and
mortality (Davey Smith et al. 1990; Geronimus et al. 1996).
Foreign nationals employed in Germany were found to have
particularly high health risks (Oppen 1985; Elkeles & Seifert
1996) and higher occupational accident rates (Weber et al.
1990) than Germans; chronic diseases are more frequent and
emerge at a younger age (Collatz 1994). Turkish residents in
Germany are believed to suffer from more severe forms of
coronary heart disease than Germans at a younger age (Bilgin
et al. 1994). They also have higher unemployment rates (Sen
1996) and less access to appropriate medical care (Collatz
1994). Many second-generation Turkish nationals born in
Germany are not fully integrated into either the German or
the Turkish culture (Collatz 1996).

So far, one study (Weber et al. 1990) compared mortality

rates of foreigners in Germany (not differentiated by
nationality) to mortality rates of the German population for
the period 1984–86. In the age group 35 to 65 years, age-
standardized all-cause mortality of foreigners was roughly
half that of Germans. The authors assumed that this was due
to a healthy migrant effect and re-migration of severely ill
individuals.

Little is known about time trends in mortality of migrants.

Cancer mortality rates in immigrants tend to be lower
initially and converge upon the rates of the host population
with increasing length of stay (Thomas & Karagas 1987).
Regarding all-cause mortality, there are indications that
initial advantages in comparison with the host population
may be maintained over years (Swerdlow 1991; Balzi et al.
1993) before wearing off (Williams 1993; Chaturvedi &
McKeigue 1994), but data are scarce.

Thus the hypothesis emerges that the mortality rate of

migrants from Turkey to Germany would initially have been
lower than that of Turks residing in Turkey and possibly that
of Germans. Over time and in the second generation, the
healthy migrant effect would wear off. To test this hypothesis
we compared all-cause mortality of Turkish residents in
Germany, Germans, and Turks living in Turkey in the period
1980–94.

Materials and methods

We extracted all-cause mortality of Turkish nationals
residing in (former West) Germany in the time period
1980–94 from annual registry data and calculated age and
sex-speciﬁc as well as age-standardized mortality rates. For
comparison, we present mortality rates of adult Germans

and of the adult population of Ankara in Turkey. Rates for
the age group 25 to under 65 years were obtained by direct
standardization using deaths in 5-year age bands (Ankara: 10-
year bands) and the German ‘standard’ population of 1987
(Statistisches Bundesamt 1991).

Denominator populations and death registration in
Germany

Population ﬁgures 1980 to 1994 by sex and age group of
Germans and of Turkish nationals residing in Germany were
obtained from the Federal Statistical Ofﬁce. German
population ﬁgures are projected forward anually, based on the
1970 and 1987 census results. Population ﬁgures of foreigners
are continuously updated by the central registry of foreigners.
From age 65 years upwards, the number of Turkish residents
is small and a breakdown by age is not available. As some
retirees remain registered in Germany but spend considerable
time in Turkey, their deaths may not be registered in
Germany. Therefore we excluded the age group 65 years and
above from the analysis. Data on migration, unemployment
and naturalization were compiled from ofﬁcial sources
(Statistisches Bundesamt 1980–1994; Cornelsen 1990;
Statistisches Bundesamt 1996).

Death ﬁgures of Germans based on death certiﬁcates were

supplied by the Federal Statistical Ofﬁce. Deaths of foreign
residents are registered by nationality only at the statistical
ofﬁces of the federal states; the place of birth is not speciﬁed.
Mortality data for Turkish residents are not routinely
available. For this study, data from all federal states of former
West Germany were compiled at the statistical ofﬁce of the
state of Baden-Württemberg. Figures exclude Turkish visitors
to Germany and former Turkish nationals who obtained a
German passport (double citizenship is not legally possible).

To calculate death rates, we estimated mid-year

populations (MYP) as the mean of the population on 31
December of the actual and of the preceding year. For
1980–84, population ﬁgures for Turkish residents are
available only for 30 September. We used these directly as the
best available estimate of MYP.

Denominator population and death registration in
Turkey

In Turkey, national censuses are carried out ﬁve-yearly with
enumeration on a present-in-area basis (State Institute of
Statistics 1980–1990a). Substantial internal migration affects
the precision of estimates for between-census years. Deaths
(but not mortality rates) are reported from province and
district centres (State Institute of Statistics 1980–1990b). It is
assumed that in spite of legal notiﬁcation requirements there
is underreporting of deaths, particularly in rural areas. For

this reason we present mortality data for Ankara only. To
obtain denominators for death rates we used estimates of the
total mid-year population for Ankara’s provincial and district
centres 1980, 1985 and 1990 and broke them down by age and
sex according to the census results (State Institute of Statistics
1980–1990a).

Results

Turkish population in Germany

Figure 1 shows the population development of Turkish men
in 10-year age groups. A generation gap is clearly visible: the
number of individuals aged 35–45 years is decreasing due to
ageing and re-migration; their number is not yet replenished
as the second generation is still mostly under 35 years of age.
For females, this effect is less pronounced (not shown). Re-
migration rates in 1981 were around 5% for males aged 25–50
and 10% in males aged 50–65 years; they decreased to below
4% in both groups from 1990 onwards. In females aged 25–50
re-migration decreased from 3% in 1981 to 2% from 1990
onwards, and in those aged 50–65 from 6% to about 3%. In
1994, 64% of Turkish residents had been in Germany for
10 years or longer (not controlled for age). Immigration is
2–3% per year. In 1987, 34% of immigrants were children
under 18 and 17% were asylum seekers (0.8% of the migrant
population). The majority were persons who had stayed in
Germany before.

Deaths

In the period 1980–94, the total number of deaths among
Turkish nationals residing in Germany was 29148. Of these,
12210 (42%) were people below 25 years of age and 1652
(6%) were people 65 years and older. The remaining 15286
deaths, 11451 (75%) of which were men, occurred in the age
group 25–64 years.

Figure 2 shows all-cause mortality rates per 100000

population in 10-year age groups for the years 1980–94.
Turkish residents in Germany consistently have the lowest
rates, 35–70% lower than that of Germans of the same sex
and age group. Death rates in Ankara are higher. German
mortality rates decrease over time, mainly as a consequence
of decreasing cardiovascular mortality. For Turkish residents
in Germany, a decrease is less distinct. Low case numbers
among females in the early 1980s lead to unstable estimates.
However, there is no indication of increasing mortality, not
even in the 1990s when the second, partly German-born
generation reaches the ages of 25–34. Figure 3 summarizes
the ﬁndings by showing truncated age-standardized rates for
males and females aged 25–64 years.

Discussion

We found no evidence to support our hypothesis of
increasing mortality among Turkish nationals resident in
Germany. On the contrary, they appear to have strikingly and
persistently lower all-cause mortality rates than the German
population and an urban population in Turkey. These are
unexpected ﬁndings. Studies from the UK and the US show
two to four-fold increased mortality in minorities and socio-
economically disadvantaged groups compared to the general
population (Davey Smith et al. 1990; Geronimus et al. 1996).
Migrant studies have demonstrated a decreasing mortality
differential over time (Williams 1993; Parkin 1993). A
decreased mortality similar in size to the one we found has
been reported in Vietnamese refugees to the UK; it persisted
for 5–10 years after arrival (Swerdlow 1991). Thus, our
ﬁndings may reﬂect research artefacts, environmental or 
biological differences between populations, or selection
processes.

Research artefacts

It is highly unlikely that the mortality differential could be
explained by errors in death registration or population
statistics in Germany. The observed difference is large and
stable over time, except for females in the early 1980s when the
number of deaths was small. Communication problems or
cultural differences that might bias cause-of-death assignment
do not affect all-cause death rates. Illegal immigration would

not have an effect as only registered individuals are counted
among both denominator populations and deaths. Deaths in
Turkey of Turkish nationals resident in Germany are not
included in German death statistics. As Germans dying while
outside Germany are also excluded, the resulting bias is
balanced out. Mortality rates in Ankara, however, could be an
underestimate due to under-reporting of deaths or an
overestimate due to referred patients from rural areas dying
there.

Environment and genetics

In many studies, socio-economic status was found to be a
strong predictor of morbidity and mortality. Turkish

residents in Germany have lower job ratings and lower
income which would explain a higher rather than the
observed lower mortality. In recent years, numerous Turkish
residents have started businesses of their own but this has not
yet led to a major change in social composition (Sen 1996).

Regarding cardiovascular risk factor levels, Turkish

residents might eat a healthier (Mediterranean) diet than
Germans, which, by reducing cardiovascular mortality, would
result in a reduction of overall mortality. Available ﬁgures,
however, suggest that risk factors such as smoking are at least
as prevalent among Turkish males as among Germans (Bilgin
et al. 1994).

Selection processes

The size of the mortality differential suggests that a selection
process may be at work. Our data are based on population
registers, not on the follow-up of individuals. While this
approach is commonly used in migrant studies (Parkin 1993),
it cannot satisfactorily account for individuals entering or
leaving the population under study. Some conclusions,
however, can be drawn regarding selection by healthy migrant
effect, healthy worker effect, change of nationality and re-
migration in case of grave illness.

Migrants constitute a self-selected population with better-
than-average health status (Weber et al. 1990; Swerdlow 1991;
Balzi et al. 1993). However, this effect is likely to wear off
over time (Williams 1993; Chaturvedi & McKeigue 1994).
Before 1973, Turkish ‘Gastarbeiter’ underwent a health exam
before being hired, but this was said to be rather superﬁcial
and is unlikely to explain the low mortality decades later.
Also, family members who followed were not examined,
further diluting a healthy migrant effect over the years.

Another obvious explanation for the differential in

mortality would be a ‘healthy worker effect’. Workers usually
have lower overall death rates than the general population
because chronically ill and disabled people are excluded from
the workforce (McMichael 1976). Fifteen years after
recruitment, this effect would not account for more than a
10% differential (Fox & Collier 1976); it can even reverse in
workers living under adverse conditions (Juel 1994).
Substantially larger reductions in mortality have only been
observed immediately after recruitment (SMR 5 0.37) (Fox
& Collier 1976), among airline pilots (SMR 5 0.63) who
undergo regular health check-ups (Band et al. 1996) and
among steel workers in Brazil (SMR , 0.5) where there is a
huge socio-economic gap between employed and unemployed
(Barreto et al. 1996). Neither would apply to Turkish
residents in Germany.

The healthy worker effect is an unlikely explanation for the

observed differential for additional reasons. First, the effect
would attenuate with ageing of the workers (McMichael

1976; Fox & Collier 1976) which we did not observe. Second,
the Turkish population in Germany consists not only of
employed persons but also of their family members, of
unemployed, chronically ill and jobless individuals. Since
1973, the employment rates of Turkish residents and of
Germans have converged. In 1988, the employment rate of
male Turkish residents (58.9%) was slightly lower than that
of German males (60.5%); that of Turkish females (27.5%)
was considerably lower than that of German females (37%).
Furthermore, 76% of employed Turkish residents but only
44% of employed Germans had a manual job (Cornelsen
1990) which, in other countries, is associated with a higher
mortality (Davey Smith et al. 1990). Immigration, at 1% per
year in the age group of interest (Statistisches Bundesamt
1980–1994), cannot explain a persisting healthy worker effect.
Naturalization is a relatively small and recent phenomenon
among Turkish residents in Germany; double citizenship is
currently not a legal option. In 1994, 4067 Turkish nationals
above 25 years of age (0.4% of the denominator population)
attained German citizenship (Statistisches Bundesamt 1996).
Considering the availability of equal medical treatment
options for Turkish residents in Germany, it is unlikely that
naturalization would be differential with regard to health
status.

In 1994, the re-migration rate to Turkey was 2.9% in the

age group 25 years and older (Statistisches Bundesamt
1980–1994). To fully explain the mortality differential, 4% of
all returnees would have to re-migrate because of grave illness
subsequently leading to death. Ensuing mortality rates of
returnees would be 10–20 times those of the Turkish
population in Germany, which should have raised attention.
Re-migration to die at home has been observed in moribund
cancer patients. It is unlikely in conditions such as
cardiovascular disease for which medical treatment in
Germany is readily available and almost free.

While Turkish residents are socio-economically

disadvantaged compared to Germans, they are nonetheless an
active and productive group (Sen 1996; Collatz 1996). Relative
socio-economic differences within the Turkish population in
Germany could be more important and smaller than those in
comparison with Germans, leading to lower mortality
(Wilkinson 1997). In addition, ﬁrst-generation Turkish
migrants may draw positive experiences from migration
(Schiffauer 1991), e.g. achieving economic and social success.
Integration into familial and religious networks offers
potentially effective ways to deal with stress (Antonovsky
1996; Collatz 1996). Thus, Turkish residents in Germany,
perhaps more so than Germans, may perceive a sense of
cohesion in their lives that is ‘salutogenic’ (Antonovsky 1996),
i.e. a protective resource. Success also inﬂuences re-migration
plans: elderly Turkish residents planning to stay in Germany
are signiﬁcantly better socially integrated and satisﬁed with

their life than those intending to re-migrate (Fabian & Straka
1993).

We thus propose an additional hypothesis to help explain

the mortality differential. Unlike emigration to another
continent, ‘Gastarbeiter’ type migration within Europe is
temporary by intention (if not necessarily so in practice) and
the migrants are comparatively mobile. In such migrant
populations a continuous selection process might be taking
place. Individuals and families who cope well socially and
economically stay in the host country; those who fail (and
thus might in future experience a higher mortality) re-migrate
even before becoming manifestly ill. As a consequence of this
(so far hypothetical) ‘unhealthy re-migration effect’, the
population remaining in the host country is constantly
selected according to low mortality risk. This effect should be
discernible in other European countries with similarly
dynamic migrant populations. It would have public health
repercussions: effects of preventive activities for migrants
would be difﬁcult to evaluate in terms of morbidity and
mortality, as those at highest risk return before disease
becomes manifest.

To learn more about what distinguishes returnees from
persons remaining in the host country, research needs to
follow up individuals. Reaching a decision to re-migrate is
likely to be a complex process. Thus it will be necessary to
carry out qualitative studies in order to obtain information
on the range of motives for re-migration.

From our data it should not be concluded that there is no
need for activities to improve the health of Turkish residents
in Germany. Overall mortality ﬁgures may fail to reveal excess
mortality from speciﬁc causes warranting public health
action. For many chronic diseases, morbidity and disability
are disproportionately higher than mortality. Common health
problems such as psychosomatic, psychiatric and musculo-
skeletal disorders are not reﬂected by mortality statistics.
Thus, when populations are compared, lower mortality rates
do not necessarily indicate better health.
