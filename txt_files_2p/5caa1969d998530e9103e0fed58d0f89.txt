Abstract
Purpose – The correlation between transformational and contingent reward leadership behaviors
and desired organizational outcomes is well established. The degree to which these behaviors can be
taught and deployed for organizational benefit is considerably less well documented. Explored even
less is the extent to which transformational leadership training impacts desired organizational
outcomes. The purpose of this paper is to examine the extent to which the positive correlational
relationship among transformational
leadership, organizational outcomes, and productivity,
extensively reported in the leadership literature, can be affirmed.
Design/methodology/approach – A large manufacturing organization, which had failed to achieve
expected productivity improvements following major capital expenditures, undertook a
comprehensive program to increase first-line supervisors’ contingent reward and transformational
leadership behaviors.
Findings – Consistent with prior studies, a significant positive relationship between the leadership
behaviors of interest, affective measures, and an objective productivity metric were observed prior to
the beginning of the training program. Following a year-long training program, contingent reward and
transformational
leadership behaviors increased significantly, as did objectively measured
productivity and job satisfaction.
Research limitations/implications – Results and conclusions may be limited by the fact that the
study is from a single industry. Additional studies from a variety of industries with large numbers of
participants will be helpful in more fully understanding the ways in which contingent reward and
transformational leadership behaviors can best be developed and deployed in organizational settings.
Practical implications – The elements of the training program are discussed, along with
implications and advice for the use of leadership training to increase productivity.
Originality/value – An objective dependent variable and a large sample, pre- and post-test design
provide strong support for the impact of a transformational leadership development intervention on
productivity.

Introduction
A recurring theme in contemporary management literature is that fundamental shifts
in the nature of competition will require new and more effective leadership responses
(Bennis, 2001; Hitt, 2000; Zahara, 1998; Hitt et al., 1998; Bettis and Hitt, 1995; D’Aveni,
1994; Kanter and Stonham, 1994). This call for leadership transformation has been
heard before. During the 1970s and early 1980s, the ascendancy of the Japanese and
German export-based economies, along with vexing macroeconomic conditions,
