The voter says no, but nobody listens:
causes and consequences of the
Eurosceptic vote in the 2014
European elections
Oliver Treib

ABSTRACT The 2014 European Parliament elections saw an unprecedented
surge of support for Eurosceptic parties. This article provides an overview of the
ideologically highly diverse Eurosceptic camp in the European Parliament and
addresses the causes and consequences of the Eurosceptic vote. Based on an analysis
of aggregate election results and opinion-poll data, it argues that the electoral success
of Eurosceptic parties cannot be dismissed as a mere protest vote against unpopular
governments. Instead, fundamental worries about the effects of European Union
(EU) policies and dissatisfaction with mainstream politics lie at the heart of the Euro-
sceptic success. The selection of Jean-Claude Juncker as President of the Commis-
sion, backed by overwhelming majorities in the European Council and the
European Parliament, suggests that Eurosceptics, despite their considerable electoral
support, will continue to be excluded from the EU’s corridors of power. This strategy
of exclusion provides the ideal breeding ground for an even stronger Eurosceptic
backlash in ﬁve years’ time.

KEY WORDS Anti-establishment politics; EU issue voting; European Parliament
elections; Euroscepticism; populism; second-order elections.

When the polling stations closed in the evening of 25 May 2014, a European
Parliament (EP) election that was in many ways unprecedented had come to
an end. It was the largest election for the European Parliament that has ever
been held in Europe. More than 12,000 candidates from almost 450 parties
and lists competed for the 751 seats in the European Parliament, and about
400 million voters from 28 member states were called upon to choose their
respective national delegates to the European Parliament.1

For the ﬁrst time since 1979, when direct elections for the European Parlia-
ment were introduced, the major European party federations made an effort to
tie the election to the decision on who should be the next President of the
European Commission. They drew up lead candidates who were considered
contenders for the position of Commission President. The idea underlying
