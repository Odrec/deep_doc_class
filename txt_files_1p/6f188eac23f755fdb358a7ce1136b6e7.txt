Abstract
Colicins are protein toxins produced by Escherichia coli to kill related
bacteria. They must cross the target cell outer membrane (OM), and
some must also cross the inner membrane (IM). To accomplish cel-
lular import, colicins have parasitized E. coli nutrient transporters as
well as IM and periplasmic proteins normally used to maintain cell wall
integrity or provide energy for nutrient uptake through transporters.
Colicins have evolved to use both transporters and other membrane
proteins through mechanisms different from those employed in phys-
iological substrate uptake. Extended receptor-binding domains allow
some colicins to search by lateral diffusion for binding sites on their
OM translocators while bound to their primary OM receptor. Trans-
port across the OM is initiated by entry of the unstructured N-terminal
translocation domain into the translocator. Periplasmic and IM net-
works subsequently accomplish insertion of the colicin cytotoxic do-
main into or across the IM.
