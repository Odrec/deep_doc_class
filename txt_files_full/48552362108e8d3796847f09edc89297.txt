Group work tasks

Topic 1: Theoretical background & Experimental designs

Explain the three Bottleneck models and their predictions!

Article 1

Which experimental factors were varied in Exp 1 to 4 to differentiate between these models?

What are the respective hypotheses?

Topic 2: Statistics and Results

Explain how to understand ANOVA results (graphically)?

List and describe R2 slowing, underadditive, additive (and overadditive) results of the Exp. 1 to 4!

Compare the R1 results of Exp 1 to 4!

Topic 3: Conclusions & Limitations

How can these results be interpreted? Which results are in favor and which are contradicting 
individual/or the bottleneck idea in general?

What are the R1 results indicating?

Next week:
Topic 1: Theoretical background & Experimental designs

Where makes the capacity sharing model different assumptions than the bottleneck model?

Describe the experimental design of Exp 5 and the different predictions it make with regard to the

two models!

Topic 2: Statistics and Results

Describe the results!

Topic 3: Conclusions & Limitations

Compare the evidence for capacity sharing and bottleneck, respectively? Can one be ruled out? Is 
a different model more likely?

Which conclusions do you draw with regard to multitasking?
