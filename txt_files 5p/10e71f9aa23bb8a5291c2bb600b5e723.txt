The Eye

(cid:73) Lens focuses image
(cid:73) Retina has

photoreceptors

(cid:73) Fovea has highest

density

(cid:73) Retina does additional

image processing

(cid:73) Output through optic

nerve (blind spot)

[Wikimedia]

From Retina to Cortex

(cid:73) Left and right visual

ﬁeld are kept separate
and cross at the optic
chiasm

(cid:73) Major “relay” in the

thalamus is the lateral
geniculate nucleus
(LGN)

(cid:73) There are also other

pathways (not shown)

[Hubel and Wiesel, 1979]

Primary Visual Cortex (V1)

(cid:73) V1 is Brodmann’s area
17 which is located at
the very back in the
occipital lobe

(cid:73) V1 is also called striate

cortex, named after
white matter in layer IV
that is visible to the
naked eye (Stria of
Gennari)

[Wikimedia]

Retinotopic Organization of V1

(cid:73) Areas that are close by

on the retina are also
close by in V1

(cid:73) Inject monkey with 2DG

(uptake in cells is
correlated with activity)

(cid:73) Show ﬂicker stimulus

(top)

(cid:73) Check which cells in V1

accumulated 2DG
(bottom)

[Tootell et al., 1982]

Receptive Fields in V1

[Hubel and Wiesel, 1959]

Response Properties

(cid:73) Cells in LGN have a

center-surround
structure

(cid:73) Cells in V1 respond best

to bar-like oriented
stimuli

(cid:73) V1 cells seem to be

edge and line detectors

[Hubel and Wiesel, 1962]

Simple Cells

(cid:73) A combination of LGN cells could explain the response
properties of simple cells (there are also complex cells)

[Hubel and Wiesel, 1962]

Beyond V1

(cid:73) The visual system is

organized hierarchically

(cid:73) There are areas with

neurons that respond to
motion, color, objects,
faces, etc.

(cid:73) Other areas control or

are inﬂuenced by
eye-movements, etc.

[Felleman and Van Essen, 1991]

About Visual Perception

(cid:73) It is not enough to study brains and behavior when you

want to study visual perception (although there are many
exciting aspects of vision that can be studied in this way)

(cid:73) Visual perception is also about how things look
(cid:73) The only way to ﬁnd out how things look is by looking

(behaviorists have little to say about perception)

(cid:73) Vision would be easier to study if the world was like we

see it (i.e., naive realism was true)

(cid:73) What is the relation between what we see and what is out

there?

(cid:73) How is our perception mediated by our senses?

Constancies

(cid:73) As a ﬁrst approximation we often see the world as it is

despite the highly variable sensor data

(cid:73) E.g. size constancy: We perceive the constant size of an
object, the distal stimulus, and not the size on the retina,
the proximal stimulus, that varies with viewing distance

[Hochberg, 1964, p. 52]

Illusions

(cid:73) Illusions: The world is not always like we see it
(cid:73) Many illusions are traces of the tricks and assumptions

that the visual system uses (e.g. Ames’ room: C, D)

[Hochberg, 1964, p. 53]

Ambiguity

(cid:73) What we see is not solely dependent on the sensory input
(cid:73) The same stimulus can lead to diﬀerent perceptions

(other examples are Rubin’s vase or the Necker cube)

[Jastrow, 1899]

Top-down Eﬀects

(cid:73) Knowledge plays a role in perception as this image by R.

Theories of Perception

(cid:73) What is the relation between what we see and what is out

there?

(cid:73) What can we know about the distal stimulus?
(cid:73) How is perception mediated by our senses?
(cid:73) How is perception determined by the proximal stimulus?
(cid:73) What role does perception play in guiding actions?

Structuralism

(cid:73) “The central structuralist assumption was this: that, with
careful analytic introspection, the same ’pure’ sensations
could be observed whenever the same stimulus energy
falls on the same part of the same sensory organ.”

[Hochberg, 1964, p. 11-12]

Gestalt Perception

(cid:73) The whole is not the sum of the parts
(cid:73) Example: A dot on the rim of a rolling wheel follows a

cycloid but when the hub is also seen you see something
else

[Duncker, 1929, Proﬃtt et al., 1979]

Perception as Unconscious Inference

(cid:73) The visual system tries to infer the state of the world from the

sensory inputs

(cid:73) The conclusion is what is perceived and we neither have direct

access to the sensor data nor the inferences

(cid:73) Technical term Unbewußter Schluß was coined by [Helmholtz, 1910,

p. 5f]

(cid:73) Example: Size constancy (use retinal size and perceived distance to

unconsciously compute actual size)

[Hochberg, 1964, p. 52ﬀ]

Depth from X

(cid:73) How can the visual system infer the distance and 3d

shape of an object from the 2d retinal images?

(cid:73) Strategy: Identify diﬀerent cues that could be used for
solving this problem and check whether the necessary
information is available and actually used

Retinal Disparity

(cid:73) The left and the right eye see slightly diﬀerent images

from which depth can be calculated

(cid:73) Retinal disparity is the diﬀerence in position of the same

point on the left and right retina

[Rock, 1984, p. 55ﬀ]

Random Dot Stereograms

(cid:73) In random dot stereograms only disparity information can

be used and leads to a vivid 3d impression

[Julesz, 2006, Rock, 1984, p. 62ﬀ]

Correspondence Problem

(cid:73) Which point in the left eye corresponds to which point in

the right eye? Without this information we cannot
calculate disparity

(cid:73) The correspondence problem can be solved by assuming

uniqueness (just one disparity value per point) and
continuity (nearby points have similar disparity values)

[Marr and Poggio, 1976, Julesz, 2006, p. 119ﬀ]

Vergence

(cid:73) The angle between the two eyes can be used as a cue for

distance

(cid:73) Note that there is no retinal disparity

[Rock, 1984, p. 55f, 64ﬀ]

Accommodation

(cid:73) The accommodation of the lens determines the distance to

the plane that is in focus and the depth of ﬁeld

(cid:73) Two potential cues: Accommodation of the lens and blur

relative to the focus plane

(cid:73) Blur plays a prominent role in tilt-shift miniaturization

[Held et al., 2010]

Motion Parallax

(cid:73) Observer moves: Direction of far objects changes less

than direction of near objects

[Rock, 1984, p. 57, 66ﬀ]

Kinetic Depth Eﬀect (aka Structure from Motion)

(cid:73) Flat moving patterns can lead to vivid 3d impression if

the pattern is consistent with 3d movement

[Rock, 1984, p. 69, 66ﬀ]

Occlusion

(cid:73) An object that occludes another object is in front

[Rock, 1984, p. 71ﬀ]

Shading

(cid:73) Shading is used in visual arts to give 3d impression
(cid:73) Assumption: Light from above

[Rock, 1984, p. 75f]

Perspective

(cid:73) Perspective is used in visual arts to give 3d impression
(cid:73) Linear and orthographic projection works

[Rock, 1984, p. 75f]

Texture Gradients

(cid:73) Information for shape

and slant is directly
given by texture

(cid:73) As opposed to

correction of perceived
shape through slant
that is inferred from
other cues

[Gibson, 1965]

Specular Reﬂections

(cid:73) Object on the left is a

perfect mirror

(cid:73) No stereo, shading, or

regular texture
information

(cid:73) Still vivid impression of
3d through local image
compressions

[Fleming et al., 2004]

Depth from Several X

(cid:73) In the real world several cues interact to give rise to the

perception of depth, distance, and size

(cid:73) How are the cues combined?
(cid:73) What is the relative importance of these cues?
(cid:73) What happens when the cues are in conﬂict with each

other?

(cid:73) Can one cue veto another cue?
(cid:73) How do artists make use of these cues in drawings and

paintings?

(cid:73) How can we make convincing 3d graphics and movies?

Summary

(cid:73) The early visual system is organized retinotopically
(cid:73) Receptive ﬁelds in LGN have a center-surround structure,

in V1 they look like edge and line detectors

(cid:73) We perceive objects (distal stimuli) and not sensory

inputs (proximal stimuli)

(cid:73) Perception displays constancies, illusions, ambiguities and

top-down eﬀects

(cid:73) As a ﬁrst approximation it is useful to treat the visual

system as performing an unconscious inference (infer the
state of the world from sensor data)

(cid:73) Depth perception relies on many cues that the visual

system can use to compute the distance and shape of an
object from retinal images

Colloquium Announcement

Dr. Vera Demberg Head of the Independent Research Group „Cognitive Models of Human Language Processing and their Application to Dialogue Systems“ Cluster of Excellence  „Multimodal Computing and Interaction“ at Saarland University The Index of Cognitive Activity (ICA) as a measure for linguistically induced processing difficulty in dual tasking and visual world experiments Abstract:  Psycholinguistic research has developed a range of cognitive models of human language processing, which have been shown (mostly in single-task settings) to account for processing difficulty effects. However, most of these measures are not suitable for usage in a realistic dual task setting (for example, language comprehension during driving), due to problems with movement artifacts or requirements of the non-linguistic task. In this talk, I will present a pupillometric measure of processing difficulty, the "Index of Cognitive Activity", which we have found useful in the dual task condition as well as for assessing linguistic processing difficulty in the visual world paradigm. During the presentation, I will discuss results from subject vs. object relative clause processing, semantic anomalies, grammatical gender mismatch and the processing of discourse connectors.

(cid:73) Find your blind spot: Draw a small cross on a white piece of paper. Draw

another cross roughly 5-7cm right of it. Close your right eye and focus on the
right cross with your left eye. Now move the paper back and forth in front of
your face. At some distance the left cross should disappear. Namely, when it
falls on your blind spot where the optic nerve leaves the eye. Notice that you
don’t see nothing in your blind spot. You see white (this phenomenon is called
ﬁlling-in). Repeat the experiment with diﬀerently colored papers. What
happens? Draw a long straight line through the two crosses and repeat the
experiment. Do you see the line in your blind spot? What will happen if the line
is dashed or dotted or the background doesn’t have one homogeneous color but
has an interesting texture (like a stone wall, or wood grain, or cloth)?

(cid:73) Michael Bach has an excellent webpage that collects a great number of classic
visual illusions [Link]. A highlight of the annual meeting of the Vision Sciences
Society (VSS) is the Best Illusion of the Year Contest [Link].

(cid:73) Movies in 3d using stereo glasses have recently become very common. Which

depth cues play a role in creating the 3d impression? Which cues create
conﬂicts for the visual system? Think about how cinematography has to change
to take cue conﬂicts into account? Next time you watch a 3d movie pay
attention to which shots look odd and what works. Do they always use stereo?
(cid:73) You’ve probably seen the Magic Eye books a.k.a. random dot autostereograms.
If you don’t know what they are ﬁnd out about them. How do they work? Can
you write a computer program that generates a square ﬂoating in front of the
picture plane?

Recommended Thinking

(cid:73) Try out the Mach-Eden illusion [Miller, 1962, p. 135]. Which depth cues are
involved? Can you do it with both eyes open? Can you push the paper strip
around without losing the impression? Describe very carefully what you see.
Play with the viewing conditions. Are there other interesting things to observe
besides the depth illusion?

(cid:73) Do you know how to use Photoshop or Gimp? Create a miniature fake by
(cid:73) Check out [Link] — this video uses Ames’ window. Can you explain what is

selective blur.

going on?

Recommended Reading

The central visual pathways are described very well and in a lot more detail in
[Kandel et al., 2000, chapter 27]. The rest of the lecture covers standard topics in
introductory perception books. There are many excellent books that you can use
[Goldstein, 2010, Hochberg, 1964, Rock, 1984]. If you can read German a more
advanced book on visual perception in the Gestalt tradition is Gesetze des Sehens
[Metzger, 1975]. Another more advanced book that I can recommend for its cognitive
view of perception is The Logic of Perception [Rock, 1983].
