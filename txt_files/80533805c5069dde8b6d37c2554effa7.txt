The yiaQRS genes of Escherichia coli K-12 are involved
in carbohydrate metabolism. Clustering of homologous
genes was found throughout several unrelated bacteria.
Strikingly, all four bacterial transport protein classes
were found, conserving transport function but not mech-
anism. It appears that during evolution the ability to
transport, phosphorylate and metabolize substrates of
unknown identity have been conserved. However, the
transporter classes have been swapped. This probably
demonstrates the subtlety of transport-protein evolution.

The gene cluster designated yiaJKLMNOPQRS (GenBank
accession number g1789999 – 1790008) in the Escherichia
coli K-12 genome (Figure 1a) has been suggested to be
involved in the uptake and metabolism of carbohydrates
[1–5]. Recently, we have demonstrated that the bind-
ing protein-dependent secondary transporter (Figure 2a)
encoded by the yiaMNO genes transports the rare pentose
L-xylulose, providing the ﬁrst evidence that these systems
are able to transport carbohydrates [6]. During character-
ization of this transporter we became interested in the
function of the remaining genes in the cluster. An increase
in the availability of genome databases has permitted a
search for similar gene clusters among other organisms.
Homologs of the individual yiaQ, yiaR and yiaS genes
were discovered in several bacterial and archaeal genomes
(T.H. Plantinga et al., unpublished). Remarkably, cluster-
ing of these genes in putative operons occurs in a limited

Figure 1. The structural organization of highly similar gene clusters that contain
yiaQRS homologs (blue). These cluster with members from any of the four classes
of bacterial transport proteins (purple). This is demonstrated in four model organ-
isms. Conventional nomenclature is used, with proposed alternatives provided
below each gene. Shades of blue identify genes that encode homologous
enzymes: yiaQ and yjfV, 3-keto-L-gulonate 6-phosphate decarboxylases; yiaR and
yjfW, (putative) L-xylulose 5-phosphate 3-epimerases; yiaS and yjfX, ribulose-5-
phosphate 4-epimerases. The (putative) kinases are shown in yellow. (a) The
yiaJ– S gene cluster of Escherichia coli K-12 contains a binding protein-dependent
secondary transporter {yiaM, small [4 transmembrane domains (TMDs)] mem-
brane protein; yiaN,
large [12 TMDs] membrane protein; yiaO, periplasmic
substrate-binding protein}. (b) The yiaJ– S gene cluster of Klebsiella oxytoca con-
tains a secondary transporter (yiaX2) and a chemotaxis-like protein (yiaX1). (c) The
yjfQ–X gene cluster of E. coli K-12 contains a phosphotransferase system (PTS)
(yjfS, permease IIC component; yjfT and yjfU, cytosolic phosphotransferase com-
ponents IIB and IIA, respectively). (d) The YPO3328-3332 genes of Yersinia pestis
encode a binding protein-dependent primary ATP-binding cassette (ABC) trans-
porter [YPO3328, periplasmic substrate-binding protein; YPO3330, ABC (ATPase)
domain; YPO3331 and YPO3332, permease domains]. The gene order is not con-
served, but yiaR, yiaS and yiaP homologs are present. Red (yiaJ and yjfQ), putative
regulators; tnp, transposase. [1– 4,7,9,17].

Figure 2. Domain structure of the four major classes of bacterial uptake systems.
(a) Binding protein-dependent secondary transporters [11 –14]. The substrate-
binding protein delivers the substrate to the membrane-localized transporter, and
unidirectional transport is driven by the proton-motive force (pmf) and/or sodium-
motive force (smf). The carrier domains are dissimilar: the small domain contains
four putative transmembrane domains (TMDs) and shows no homology with
known membrane proteins, whereas the large domain resembles classical second-
ary transporters; it contains 12 putative TMDs and a large central cytosolic loop.
(b) Secondary transporters facilitate solute uptake in a pmf- and/or smf-dependent
manner [15]. A single integral membrane protein mediates reversible transport.
(c) Phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase systems (PTS) use
multiple cytosolic components, such as the IIA and IIB proteins, to transfer the
phosphoryl group from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to the carbohydrate substrate
that is taken up via the IIC membrane domain [10]. (d) Binding protein-dependent
primary transporters are members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter
superfamily [16]. The binding protein donates the solute to two identical or homo-
logous membrane-localized transport domains. Subsequently, transport is driven
by hydrolysis of ATP, which is mediated by two identical or homologous ATPases
that are associated with the carrier at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane.

number of bacterial genomes. The conserved genomic organ-
ization suggests that these genes specify similar functions.

Clustering of putative carbohydrate-metabolizing
enzymes
An extensive search of accessible genome databases has
revealed 30 gene clusters containing putative enzymes
that are highly similar to those encoded by the yiaQRS
genes, and in most cases the gene order is well conserved
(Figure 1). Interestingly, representatives are found in
several unrelated Gram-positive and -negative bacterial
species, most of which are known human pathogens
(Table 1). Clustering of these three enzymes is found in
26 completely sequenced bacterial genomes that are
available at this time, and also in the relatively small
genomes of three Mycoplasma species (Table 1). Although
homologs of the individual genes are found in the Archaea,
the cluster does not appear to be conserved in members of
this kingdom.

To date, only the E. coli K-12 enzymes have been
biochemically characterized in detail. YiaQ has been
suggested to function as a 3-keto-L-gulonate 6-phosphate
decarboxylase based on a comparison with its homolog
Yjf V [7]. Because of amino acid sequence homology,
YiaQ has also been suggested to function as a hexulose
6-phosphate synthase [5], but this activity has not been
demonstrated experimentally [8]. The YiaR amino acid
sequence shows a high similarity to 3-epimerases, and
