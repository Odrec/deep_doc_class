The Na+ gradient produced across the cardiac sarcolemma by the ATP-dependent Na+-pump is a constant
source of energy for Na+-dependent transporters. The plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) is one
such secondary active transporter, regulating intracellular pH, Na+ concentration, and cell volume. NHE1,
the major isoform found in the heart, is activated in response to a variety of stimuli such as hormones and
mechanical stress. This important characteristic of NHE1 is intimately linked to heart diseases, including mal-
adaptive cardiac hypertrophy and subsequent heart failure, as well as acute ischemic-reperfusion injury.
NHE1 activation results in elevation of pH and intracellular Na+ concentration, which potentially enhance
downstream signaling cascades in the myocardium. Therefore, in addition to determining the mechanism un-
derlying regulation of NHE1 activity, it is important to understand how the ionic signal produced by NHE1 is
transmitted to the downstream targets. Extensive studies have identiﬁed many accessory factors that interact
with NHE1. Here, we have summarized the recent progress on understanding the molecular mechanism un-
derlying NHE1 regulation and have shown a possible signaling pathway leading to cardiac remodeling, which
is initiated from NHE1. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled “Na+ Regulation in Cardiac Myocytes”.

provided by Na+–K+-ATPase. The housekeeping isoform NHE1 is a
key regulator of intracellular pH (pHi), Na+ concentration, and cell vol-
ume in virtually all tissues [1]. In cardiac muscles, intracellular acidosis
results in Na+-overload via NHE1, followed by a sustained increase in
the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration via cardiac Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. In
addition, acidosis itself seriously reduces myoﬁbrilar Ca2+ sensitivity,
resulting in contractile dysfunction. Therefore, it is important for cardiac
muscles to rapidly remove acid load during contraction, particularly
under pathological conditions such as ischemia.

NHE1 has also been implicated in cardiac hypertrophy and chronic
heart disease. In various diseased animal models, the NHE1 inhibitor
had a highly beneﬁcial effect [2]. The involvement of NHE1 in chronic
disease is strongly linked to the ﬁnding that NHE1 is activated in

response to hormones such as endothelin-1 and norepinephrine, as
well as mechanical stress like stretching; these factors are all inducers
of cardiac remodeling. In studies on NHE1, 2 fundamental questions
arise: 1) How is NHE1 regulated? and 2) What does NHE1 regulate?
Many upstream and downstream targets of NHE1 have been identiﬁed.
In this review, we will brieﬂy summarize the basic knowledge on the
NHE1 molecule and then report the recent progress on several accesso-
ry factors of NHE1, which play critical roles in the regulation of NHE1 ac-
tivity. Finally, we will discuss the ampliﬁcation of downstream signaling
pathways by NHE1 activation, leading to cardiac remodeling. The
structure–function relationship and pathological aspects of this trans-
port system have been extensively reviewed earlier [2–9]. Interested
readers should also refer to these reviews.

2. Na+/H+ exchanger molecule

In 1989, Sardet et al. ﬁrst cloned the human Na+/H+ exchanger
cDNA by genetic complementation of exchanger-deﬁcient cells [10].
This protein is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues and is now known
as NHE1. Since the initial identiﬁcation of NHE1, 9 isoforms have been
discovered, referred to as NHE1–NHE9. NHE1–NHE5 are expressed in
the plasma membrane, while NHE6–NHE9 localize to the intracellular
membranes such as the Golgi apparatus and endosomes [11]. In contrast
to the ubiquitous expression of NHE1, NHE2–NHE5 show a restricted ex-
pression pattern: for example, NHE2–NHE4 is predominantly expressed
in the epithelial cells of the kidney, small intestine and stomach, and
NHE5 is mainly expressed in the brain. In addition to NHE1–NHE9, at
least 3 different exchangers or exchanger-like proteins (NHA1–2 and
sperm-NHE) are known [12,13]. Interestingly, human NHA2, which
shares homology with the bacterial Na+/H+ antiporter NhaA, is an
amiloride-insensitive and phloretin-inhibitable cation-H+ exchanger
that may be involved in essential hypertension [14,15]. Sperm-NHE is
critical for male fertility and sperm motility [16]. It contains a potential
voltage sensor and a consensus cyclic nucleotide-binding motif [16] and
has been shown to be important for bicarbonate regulation of adenylate
cyclase [17].

NHE1 is the major isoform found in cardiac muscle. NHE1 can be sep-
arated into the amino (N)-terminal transmembrane domain (~500 resi-
dues) catalyzing ion transport and the carboxy (C)-terminal hydrophilic
cytoplasmic domain (~300 residues) mediating the regulation of ex-
change activity. Derivatives of the NHE1 inhibitor amiloride are known
to interact with the N-terminal domain of NHE1 [18–20]. Initial cysteine
accessibility analysis allowed us to construct a topology model of NHE1
consisting of 12 transmembrane spanning segments with some
membrane-protruding regions (Fig. 1A) [21]. The 3-dimensional structur-
al model [22,23], based on the structure of NhaA [24], predicts the cation-
and inhibitor-binding sites provided by several transmembrane helices
(TMs 4 and 9). The predicted topology model [23] is slightly different
from the previously described model of NHE1 [21]. At least in part of
the NHE1 overexpressed in ﬁbroblasts, the N-terminal tail just prior to
the ﬁrst hydrophobic segment (or the ﬁrst putative transmembrane do-
main, TM1) was detected as a part of the mature molecule [21],
suggesting that the N-terminus is not cleaved. However, in vitro topology
analysis later showed the presence of a signal sequence, suggesting the
possible cleavage of the N-terminus [25]. Recent amino acid sequencing
analysis of NHE1 puriﬁed from ﬁbroblasts or SF9 insect cells revealed
that cleavage indeed occurs between Gly-36 and Leu-37 just behind
TM1 (cleavage site in Fig. 1A) (Wakabayashi, S., unpublished observa-
tion). Therefore, the initial experiment [21] might instead detect a
minor fraction of NHE1 in which the N-tail remained under forced
expression.

NHE1 exists as a homodimer in the plasma membrane [26–28],
with a compact globular domain assigned to the transmembrane do-
main [29]. Although dimerization essentially occurs between the
N-terminal transmembrane domains of 2 subunits [28], there is evi-
dence that the cytoplasmic domains also contribute to dimer formation

[27]. While dimerization with a catalytically inactive NHE1 mutant
markedly reduced the exchange activity of the wild-type NHE1 through
an acidic shift of the pHi dependence [30], such dominant negative effect
was not observed when the cytoplasmic H+ concentration was sufﬁ-
ciently high [28,30]. These observations support the view that dimeriza-
tion of 2 active subunits is required for NHE1 to possess exchange
activity in the neutral pHi range, although each subunit is capable of cat-
alyzing transport in the acidic pHi range. This notion is supported by the
kinetic data obtained using oscillating pH electrodes combined with
whole cell patch clamp and can be explained by the “coupled dimer
model,” in which 2 Na+ and 2 H+ ions are transported per cycle [31].

NHE1 catalyzes an electroneutral exchange of Na+ and H+ across the
membrane. In contrast to external pH dependence, the concentration
dependence of cytosolic H+ on Na+/H+ exchange is much steeper,
with a Hill coefﬁcient of >2. Such pHi dependence suggests the existence
of more than 1 H+ binding site. Activation of the exchange activity by cy-
tosolic H+ is explained by the presence of additional H+-binding site(s)
(H+-modiﬁer site or H+-sensor) [32,33]. However, a recent study
reported that H+ activation of NHE1 is best explained by an allosteric
model for a dimer transporter without considering an additional H+ sen-
sor site [34]. Such a model is well ﬁtted to the activation of NHE1 in re-
sponse to mitogens and osmotic stress [34,35]. Although a deﬁnitive
conclusion for the mechanism underlying H+ activation awaits detailed
mapping of H+-binding sites on the NHE1 molecule, several critical
amino acid residues such as Glu-131, Arg-327, and Arg-440 have been
identiﬁed as important determinants of the pHi dependence of NHE1
[34,36,37]. It is generally accepted that acute activation of NHE1 occurs
via an increase in the afﬁnity of cytoplasmic H+ for NHE1, rather than
an increase in the maximal exchange activity (Vmax).

3. Regulation of NHE1

NHE1 is activated in response to various extracellular stimuli. This is
thought to occur via the interaction of accessory proteins or bioactive sub-
stances with the cytoplasmic domain by a phosphorylation-dependent or
phosphorylation-independent mechanism. The cytoplasmic domain of
NHE1 has been reported to interact with various proteins, including
Ca2+-binding proteins, protein kinases, phosphatases, and cytoskeletal
proteins [38–48]. In addition, NHE1 is known to be phosphorylated at
Ser-703 by p90 ribosomal S6 kinase [49] and at Ser-648 by protein kinase
B/Akt [50,51]. Furthermore, the distal cytoplasmic region of NHE1 is phos-
phorylated at multiple sites [52–54]. Identiﬁcation of many accessory fac-
tors and multiple phosphorylation sites has suggested that regulation of
NHE1 occurs through a complex process. However, the precise binding
sites of accessory factors on NHE1 have been determined in only a few ex-
amples. In addition, a previous serial deletion mutant study [55] showed
that the pHi sensitivity of NHE1 was largely affected only by the deletion
of 2 cytoplasmic subdomains, the juxtamembrane cytoplasmic domain
with ~100 residues (amino acid [aa] 500–600) and the autoinhibitory
middle region (aa 636–659). Therefore, accessory factors linked to these
2 subdomains may have a larger impact on the acute regulation of ex-
change activity. Here, we have summarized research progress on the 3 ac-
cessory factors that have been studied most extensively: Calcineurin B
homologous protein (CHP), calmodulin (CaM), and phospholipids
interacting with these subdomains.

3.1. Calcineurin B homologous protein

Of the accessory proteins that interact with the exchangers, the
greatest attention has been focused on calcineurin B homologous
proteins (CHPs) [56]. CHPs were identiﬁed at nearly the same time
by 4 separate groups by using different strategies: phage library
screening [39]; yeast 2-hybrid screening [57] (personal communica-
tion from Dr. Hiroshi. Kanazawa, 1996); immunoprecipitation with
NHE1 [58], as an NHE1-interacting protein; and biochemical meth-
odology, as a protein (p22) involved in vesicular transport [59].

Fig. 1. (A) Topology model of NHE1 and 3-dimensional structure of accessory proteins in complex with NHE1-derived peptides. NHE1 is separated into 2 large domains, the
N-terminal transmembrane domain (~500 residues) containing membrane-spanning helices and the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (~300 residues) interacting with various cy-
tosolic factors. Binding sites of calcineurin B homologous protein (CHP), calmodulin (CaM), and calcineurin A (CaN-A) in the NHE1 cytoplasmic domain have been indicated. Struc-
tural models for the CHP2–NHE1 peptide (B) and CaM–NHE1 peptide (C) were created from protein data (pdb ID: 2BEC[65] and 2YGG[79], respectively). The green spheres indicate
Ca2+ ions. (D) The structure of the CaN–NHE1-peptide complex was modeled using PD-FAMS Ligand & Complex [141] by replacing PHPVIVITGPHEE with the NHE1-derived se-
quence DLPVITIDPASPQ based on the reference structure (pdb ID: 2P6B) [137]. Only part of the overall structure (2CaN-A/2CaN-B/NHE1-peptide complex) is represented in this
ﬁgure. NHE1-derived peptide forming β-strand (ball-stick representation) is sandwiched by β-sheets of 2 CaN-A molecules. LID, lipid-interacting domain; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol
4,5-bisphosphate; M1 and M2, PIP2-binding sites.

Three isoforms are known, which share homology with the B subunit of
calcineurin. CHP1 is expressed in virtually all tissues, including the
heart, while the expression of CHP2 is limited to intestinal epithelia
[60] and malignant tumor cells [61]. The third isoform, CHP3 (also
called as tescalcin), was initially identiﬁed in the mouse testis [62,63],
and its expression is reported to be limited to restricted tissues such
as the heart, brain, and stomach, in addition to the testis [64].

CHP is a Ca2+-binding protein with EF-hand motifs and is
myristoylated at the N-terminus (Gly2). CHP1 and CHP2 (and probably
CHP3 too) interact with the juxtamembrane domain of the plasma
membrane Na+/H+ exchangers (see Fig. 1A). Three-dimensional struc-
ture determination showed that the cytoplasmic α-helix (Arg-516 to
His-540) of NHE1 is inserted into the hydrophobic cleft formed by the
N- and C-lobes of CHP1 or CHP2 in the C- to N-terminus orientation of
the α-helix (Fig. 1B) [65,66]. Formation of multiple hydrogen bonds pre-
cisely determines the orientation for insertion of the α-helix [65,66].
Since the Ca2+ afﬁnity of CHP1 and CHP2 is extremely high (nanomolar
order) upon interaction with NHE1, EF-hands together with bound Ca2+
ions may be more important structurally than as a Ca2+ sensor [65,67].
NHE1 lacking the CHP-binding domain can be expressed in the plasma
membrane, but it exhibits very low exchange activity [68,69] and
shows greatly shifted pHi dependence of the exchange to the acidic
side [67]. Furthermore, such NHE1 mutants show shorter half-lives in
the plasma membrane [69]. Importantly, deﬁciency of CHP1 drastically
impairs plasma membrane expression of NHE1 [70], suggesting that
CHP1 is required for optimal surface expression of NHE1. Similar to
CHP1, CHP3 also increases the retention of NHE1 in the plasma

membrane [71,72]. Thus, the primary function of CHP1 (and probably
of other CHP isoforms too), as an essential subunit, appears to be stabi-
lization of the NHE1 structure in the physiologically relevant conforma-
tion for optimal surface expression and exchange activity. Indeed, the
expression of endogenous CHP1 increases with increasing amount of
NHE1 [67,73] and CHP1 is copuriﬁed with NHE1 from ﬁbroblasts at
nearly 1:1 stoichiometry [48]. Taken together, these results suggest
that NHE1 primarily forms a complex with CHP1 in the plasma mem-
brane. CHP1 is phosphorylated in cells [39]; however, the role of this
phosphorylation awaits further investigation. Although EF-hands and
the ﬂexible loop connecting the N- and C-lobes of CHP (see Fig. 1B) at
least partly contribute to the pHi sensitivity of basal exchange activity
[65,67], it is not clear whether or how CHP is involved in the external
stimulus-induced activation of NHE1. In cardiac muscles, both CHP1
and CHP3 are expressed; however, it is not yet known how cardiac
NHE1 is differentially regulated via interaction with these distinct CHP
isoforms.

3.2. Calmodulin

Stimulation of Gq-coupled receptors induces hydrolysis of phos-
phatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) by phospholipase C, which
in turn produces 2 second messengers: diacylglycerol (DAG), which
is a protein kinase C activator, and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3),
which leads to the release of calcium from the endoplasmic or sarco-
plasmic reticulum through the IP3 receptor [74]. Ca2+ mobilization is
known to activate NHE1. This Ca2+-induced activation of NHE1 is

S. Wakabayashi et al. / Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology 61 (2013) 68–76

71

attributable to direct interaction of Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM) with
NHE1 [75]. Abundantly expressed CaM is known to directly bind to
the 2 neighboring regions in the middle of the cytoplasmic domain
of NHE1 (Fig. 1A), i.e., aa 637–656 (site A) with high afﬁnity (Kd =
~20 nM) and aa 657–700 (site B) with intermediate afﬁnity (Kd =
~350 nM) in the presence of Ca2+[38]. Mutations that prevent
CaM binding to the high-afﬁnity site A render NHE1 constitutively
active and Ca2+ activation-defective [75]; it was proposed that in
the resting state, when NHE1 is not bound to CaM, NHE1 activity is
suppressed by reduction of cytoplasmic H+ afﬁnity and that Ca2+-
induced activation of NHE1 occurs via displacement of this autoin-
hibitory domain from the putative H+-sensor site due to direct bind-
ing of Ca2+/CaM [76,77]. The importance of both site A and site B in the
regulation of NHE1 was supported by a recent study using mutants of
these regions [78]. The crystal structure of the NHE1 cytoplasmic region
in complex with Ca2+/CaM was recently solved [79]. Surprisingly,
according to the crystal structure, the C- and N-lobes of just 1 CaM mol-
ecule, but not 2 CaM molecules, bind site A and site B, respectively
(Fig. 1C). The NHE1 helices and the Ca2+-bound CaM are in an elongat-
ed form, resembling the unliganded conformation of CaM. This repre-
sents a new mode of CaM interaction with the target molecule. The
second N-lobe binding site B may play a role in facilitating the release
of the autoinhibitory C-lobe binding site A, which would not be easily
accessible in the resting state.

A serine residue (Ser-648) within the ﬁrst CaM-binding site was iden-
tiﬁed as a substrate for phosphorylation by protein kinase B/Akt [51].
Phosphorylation of Ser-648 resulted in the abrogation of CaM binding
and reduction of NHE1 activity following intracellular acidosis in
cardiomyocytes [51]. In cardiac cells, intracellular acidosis increases
[Ca2+]i and would thus facilitate Ca2+/CaM binding to NHE1, leading to
activation of exchange activity. Therefore, the inhibition of NHE1 activity
by protein kinase B would become more remarkable under such acidic
conditions [51]. This may provide a possible mechanism for the protec-
tive effect of protein kinase B during myocardial ischemia-reperfusion.
In ﬁbroblasts, however, the impact of phosphorylation of Ser-648
on NHE1 activity appears to be different [50]. Tyrosine phosphoryla-
tion of CaM by Janus kinase 2 was proposed to activate NHE1 under
hyperosmotic stress via increased CaM binding to NHE1 [80]. Such links
among CaM, Janus kinase 2, and NHE1 were also suggested in the activa-
tion of NHE1 via bradykinin B2 [81] or 5-hydroxytrptamine-1A receptors
[82]. However, the mechanism by which tyrosine phosphorylation of
CaM by Janus kinase 2 enhances its interaction with NHE1 at the molec-
ular level remains unclear.

3.3. Lipids

Since the discovery of the essential role of Phosphatidylinositol
4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) in the regulation of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger and
K+ channel by Hilgemann et al. [83], the regulation of transporters and
ion channels by PIP2 has been an exciting ﬁeld in the physiological sci-
ences. Aharonovitz et al. [84] ﬁrst demonstrated that NHE1 contains the
regions interacting with PIP2 in its juxtamembrane cytoplasmic domain.
Two cationic regions (M1 and M2) harboring a CHP-binding domain
were identiﬁed as potential PIP2-binding sites (Fig. 1A) [84]. Interaction
of NHE1 with PIP2 was found to be required for basal exchange activity,
and dephosphorylation of PIP2 was hypothesized to be a mechanism for
NHE1 inhibition induced by ATP-depletion [84,85]. Measurement of the
extracellular H+ gradient during a whole-cell patch clamp experiment
with perfusion of the cell interior suggested that PIP2 is indeed a direct ac-
tivator of NHE1 [86]. A subsequent experiment showed that these cationic
regions of NHE1 have a signiﬁcant afﬁnity for other phosphoinositides
such as phosphotidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate [PIP3] [87]. Such cat-
ionic regions also exist in NHE3, which has a signiﬁcant homology with
NHE1, and have been shown to interact with PIP2 and PIP3[88]. Neutrali-
zation of basic residues by mutagenesis or perturbation interfering with
charge interaction inhibited the NHE3 exchange activity, suggesting that

electrostatic interaction between the basic residues and the membrane
surface charge is required for the activity [89].
In addition to
polyphosphoinositides, cationic regions from NHE1 [90] or NHE3 [89]
appear to widely interact with acidic phospholipids such as
phosphatidylserine. This broad lipid speciﬁcity of exchangers becomes
important when we consider the abundance of these acidic phospho-
lipids in the inner leaﬂet of the plasma membrane [91].

The region from the C-terminus to the second cationic region (M2)
in NHE1 is followed by a region enriched with hydrophobic residues
(e.g., 573LIAFY577) that are predicted to bind lipids. Similar to the cationic
regions, deletion or mutation of these residues resulted in a marked re-
duction in NHE1 activity concomitant with the acidic shift of pHi depen-
dence. The relatively long segment (aa 542–598) containing 57 residues
(designated as the lipid-interacting domain [LID]), including the second
PIP2-binding site, was suggested to directly interact with phorbol esters,
which are strong PKC activators [90]. Interestingly, GFP-labeled LID
within the cells translocated to the plasma membrane in response to
phorbol esters, a membrane-permeable diacylglycerol (DAG) analog,
and a G-protein-coupled receptor agonist, likely via increasing the afﬁn-
ity of LID to the membrane, and these stimuli all induced the activation
of NHE1 [90]. However, mutation of hydrophobic residues inhibited
such LID translocation and abolished activation of NHE1 [90]. This
suggested a new mechanism for hormonal activation of NHE1 via di-
rect interaction of DAG, followed by a more stable association with
acidic membrane lipids [90].

4. Involvement of NHE1 in cardiac disease

There is ample evidence suggesting that NHE1 mediates cardiac
injuries induced by ischemia-reperfusion [92]. This is based on stud-
ies indicating that NHE1 inhibitors such as cariporide [93], eniporide
[94] and zoniporide [95] afford signiﬁcant protection against these in-
juries in many animal models and in patients undergoing coronary
interventions [96,97]. Evidence that mice lacking the Nhe1 gene are
resistant to ischemia-reperfusion injury further supports the poten-
tial involvement of NHE1 in these injuries [98]. However, in a recent
report, paradoxical resistance to myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury
was observed in transgenic mice overexpressing NHE1, likely due to the
ER stress response rather than NHE1 activation [99].

NHE1 is also implicated in the cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure
that often result from post-infarction remodeling. In addition to causing
dysregulation of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis, enhanced activities
and/or expression levels of NHE1 mRNA and protein are thought to
be responsible for the cardiac remodeling observed in various animal
models. In addition, treatment with NHE1 inhibitors reduced the path-
ological phenotypes of these animals. For example, enhanced activity of
the Na+/H+ exchanger was detected in the spontaneously hyperten-
sive rat (SHR) [100], in the Goto-Kakizaki rat model of type 2 diabetes
[101], and in the guanylyl cyclase A knockout (GC-A KO) mouse [102],
all of which exhibited pathological hypertrophy. The inhibition of Na+/
H+ exchange prevented hypertrophy, ﬁbrosis, and heart failure in
β1-adrenergic receptor transgenic mice in which cardiac NHE1 was
upregulated at both the mRNA (140%) and protein (42%) levels [103].
A similar protective effect of cariporide was reported in pacing-induced
heart failure in rabbits [104] and in the SHRs [105]. Furthermore, in
both animal and human hearts, sarcolemmal NHE activity was demon-
strated to be signiﬁcantly elevated during chronic end-stage heart
failure [106].

Because many signal transduction pathways are activated in
these models, it is not clear whether activation of NHE1 alone is suf-
ﬁcient to induce hypertrophy. This question was directly addressed
by characterizing transgenic mice overexpressing an activated form of
human NHE1 in a cardiac-speciﬁc manner [73,107]. This form of NHE1
lacks the CaM-binding autoinhibitory domain (aa 637–656) [75], which
results in an alkaline shift of pHi-dependence and hence mimics the
pathological states where hormonal stimulation occurs. It has been

72

S. Wakabayashi et al. / Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology 61 (2013) 68–76

demonstrated that activation of NHE1 is sufﬁcient to initiate cardiac hy-
pertrophy and heart failure via activation of Ca2+-dependent
prohypertrophic signaling pathways (see Fig. 2), and possibly via
acceleration of Ca2+-induced cell death. Such detrimental effects
of NHE1 overexpression are largely prevented by administration
of cariporide [73].

5. Downstream signaling leading to cardiac hypertrophy and heart
failure

NHE1 is activated in response to various hormones such as
endothelin-1 [108], angiotensin II [109], and α1-adrenergic agonists
[110], as well as mechanical stimuli like stretching [111–113], all of
which contribute to cardiac remodeling [2,108,114]. Stretch-induced
NHE1 activation may occur via hormone receptor activation caused by
an autocrine–paracrine mechanism [115]. NHE1 couples H+ efﬂux to
Na+ inﬂux under the driving force of a Na+ gradient formed by the
Na+-pump. Therefore, activation of NHE1 is thought to increase [Na+]i,
if we assume constant Na+-pump activity. In addition, NHE1 activation
primarily occurs through the alkaline shift of pHi dependence of the ex-
change activity, i.e., decrease in the pHi threshold (or increase in the pH
setpoint). Thus, NHE1 activation results in long-lasting intracellular alka-
linization, most prominent in the absence of bicarbonate. Therefore, we
need to consider 2 cytosolic ionic changes caused by NHE1 activation:
1) increase in [Na+]i and 2) increase in pHi, both of which serve as im-
portant initial events for the downstream signaling leading to cardiac
remodeling.

In the myocardium, Na+ homeostasis is closely linked to intracellular
Ca2+ handling via the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX), the principal mech-
anism for Ca2+ efﬂux from cardiomyocytes. NCX catalyzes the electro-
genic Na+/Ca2+ exchange at a stoichiometry of 1 Ca2+:3 Na+ across
the sarcolemma and works in the reverse mode (Ca2+ inﬂux mode)
under depolarization [116]. Increased [Na+]i by NHE1 activation induces

a sustained increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration by decreasing the
forward and/or increasing the reversed mode of NCX [117]. In fact, the
relative importance of increased [Na+]i has been reported in the failing
myocardium [118–121]. Given the 1:3 stoichiometry of NCX, an increase
of only 25% in [Na+]i is expected to result in a 2-fold increase in
[Ca2+]i. Such NHE-induced increase in Ca2+ entry through the NCX
has been suggested in several experimental models, such as stretched
ventricular muscles [111,112], heart failure with volume and pressure
overload [122], and endothelin-1-induced hypertrophy [121]. Fluores-
cence measurement with the null-point method has shown that [Na+]i
is almost 1.5-fold higher in NHE1 transgenic mice than in wild-type
mice [73]. Furthermore, both diastolic and systolic Ca2+ levels have
been found to increase (Fig. 2B) as a consequence of Na+-induced Ca2+
overload followed by enhanced sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-pumping
via Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)-dependent phos-
phorylation of phospholamban [73].

An increase in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration activates 2 im-
portant Ca2+-dependent prohypertrophic signaling molecules, CaMKII
and calcineurin (CaN) [123]. CaMKII is known to induce nuclear export
of histone deacetylase (HDAC) by its phosphorylation, thereby pro-
moting cardiomyocyte hypertrophy by blocking HDAC-dependent
inhibition of target gene transcription [124]. On the other hand,
CaN induces nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor of activated
T cells (NFAT) by its dephosphorylation and consequently activates
hypertrophic gene expression [123]. Both signaling pathways are
highly activated in NHE1 transgenic mice [73]. Activation of CaMKII
has also been reported to be a major NHE1-dependent hypertrophic
molecule in guanylyl cyclase A knockout mice [102]. NHE1 inhibitor
induces regression of cardiac hypertrophy with concomitant reduc-
tion of CaN/NFAT signaling in SHRs with cardiac hypertrophy [125],
and more recently, ginseng, a medicinal plant, has been reported to
inhibit hormone-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and heart failure
via NHE1 inhibition and attenuation of the CaN pathway [126].

Fig. 3. Relationship of NHE1 with upstream and downstream target proteins leading to cardiac hypertrophy. Stimulation of Gq-coupled receptors (GPCR) with hormones such as
norepinephrine (NE) or endothelin-1 (ET1) induces hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) by phospholipase C (PLC), which in turn produces 2 second mes-
sengers: diacylglycerol (DAG), which is a protein kinase C (PKC) activator, and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, which releases Ca2+ from Ca2+ stores via IP3 receptors. Ca2+/calmod-
ulin (CaM) activates NHE1 via direct interaction. DAG is also suggested to directly activate NHE1 via interaction with its lipid-interacting domain. The role of PKC is unknown
because it does not directly phosphorylate NHE1. NHE1 activation results in elevation of [Na+]i and pHi. [Na+]i increase leads to sustained increase in [Ca2+]i by the inhibition
of Ca2+ efﬂux or acceleration of Ca2+ inﬂux via the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX). Elevated [Ca2+]i activates at least 2 Ca2+-dependent prohypertrophic signaling molecules,
Ca2+/CaM-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) and calcineurin (CaN). Activation of CaMKII phosphorylates histone deacetylase (HDAC) and induces derepression of myocyte enhancer
factor 2 (MEF2), while CaN dephosphorylates nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and enhances hypertrophic gene transcription upon binding to the transcription factor
GATA. Activated CaMKII also causes the phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLB) and the ryanodine receptor (RyR). These changes lead to acceleration of sarcoplasmic reticulum
Ca2+ uptake via the Ca2+ pump (SERCA) and Ca2+ release via RYR, and thereby enhance the Ca2+-handling process. On the other hand, NHE1 activation results in pHi increase in
the vicinity of NHE1 and thereby sensitizes CaN bound to NHE1 by increasing its catalytic activity and Ca2+ sensitivity to CaM. In this ﬁgure, it should be noted that signaling from
only the Gq-coupled receptor is illustrated, although regulation of NHE1 would be more complex.

Furthermore, the [Na+]i rise was recently postulated to activate
salt-inducible kinase 1, which potentiates hypertrophic gene expres-
sion [127]. Thus, [Na+]i and subsequent [Ca2+]i increase by NHE1 acti-
vation appears to play a role in cardiac remodeling by promoting ionic
change.

In addition to [Na+]i elevation, increase in pHi is another impor-
tant ionic event caused by NHE1 activation and may also contribute
to cardiac remodeling. Elevated pHi activates various enzymes, in-
cluding protein kinases and phosphatases, and is therefore generally
expected to promote hypertrophic responses such as protein syn-
thesis. The pHi in cardiomyocytes is ﬁnely regulated by various pH-

regulating transporters, including acid extruders and acid loaders
[128]. Therefore, in the presence of bicarbonates, H+ extrusion ac-
celerated by NHE1 is rapidly compensated by acid loading through
other anion transporters; NHE1-induced cytoplasmic alkalinization
may thus be negligible. Indeed, bulk pHi elevation was hardly detected
in cardiomyocytes isolated from NHE1 transgenic mice with physiolog-
ical buffer containing bicarbonate [73], further supporting that pHi
increase does not appear to contribute largely to NHE1-dependent
hypertrophy. However, rapid H+ extrusion by activated NHE1 may
produce a high-pH microenvironment in the vicinity of NHE1, dis-
tinct from the bulk pHi. Several studies have reported that NHE1

74

S. Wakabayashi et al. / Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology 61 (2013) 68–76

exists at least in part as a cluster in lipid rafts in the plasma membrane
[48,129–133] and produces a high pH microdomain in oligodendrites
[134]. Further, NHE1 has been proposed to function as a plasma mem-
brane scaffold in the assembly of signaling complexes [135]. In fact,
NHE1 can produce a local pHi gradient of up to 0.2 pH units in
cardiomyocytes [128]. This gradient would be more prevalent at par-
ticular sites such as lipid rafts expressing clustered NHE1 [48,129–133]
or at the intercalated disc regions of the cardiomyocytes showing the
high-density expression of NHE1 [136]. Therefore, pH-sensitive en-
zymes that directly bind to NHE1 or exist in close contact with NHE1,
such as Ca2+-sensitive adenylyl cyclase [131], may be efﬁciently con-
trolled through local pH elevation produced by NHE1, as compared to
enzymes in the bulk space.

Recently, the Ca2+-dependent signaling molecule CaN was identi-
ﬁed as a direct binding partner for NHE1 [48]. The CaN-A subunit inter-
acts with the 6-residue motif 715PVITID720 within the distal cytoplasmic
domain of NHE1, which shares homology with the CaN-A binding site of
NFATs (CaN-A binding consensus motif, PxIxIT) (Figs. 1A and 2D). This
6-residue motif, which forms the β-strand, interacts with the edge of
the β-sheet of 2 CaN-A molecules based on the structural model
constructed from the previously solved structure [137] (Fig. 1D). This
relatively loose interaction would allow CaN to easily separate from
NHE1 and to move to other targets such as NFATs. The importance of
the moderate afﬁnity of CaN against targets has recently been reported
in the case of the scaffold protein AKAP150/79, which ampliﬁes NFAT
signaling via direct interaction with CaN [138]. Surprisingly, CaN has re-
markable pH sensitivity; upon pH increase from 7 to 8, CaN activity was
found to be enhanced 8-fold in the presence of sufﬁcient Ca2+/CaM,
while Ca2+-sensitivity to CaN increased 5-fold [48]. Overexpression of
NHE1 enhanced the NFAT promoter activity, facilitated nuclear translo-
cation of NFAT (Fig. 2C), and promoted cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, but
deletion of the CaN-binding site signiﬁcantly reduced these responses
[48], suggesting that the direct signal relay between NHE1 and CaN at
least partly contributes to NHE1-dependent NFAT signaling. Thus,
NHE1 appears to have a dual effect on CaN activation: 1) activation of
bulk CaN via [Na+]i increase, followed by [Ca2+]i increase; and 2) acti-
vation of NHE1-bound CaN by a local increase in pH, which increases
the sensitivity of CaN to Ca2+ (Fig. 3).

6. Conclusion

A large body of evidence has indicated the contribution of NHE1 in
cardiac remodeling and heart failure. In Fig. 3, we have summarized
the relationship between NHE1 and its upstream and downstream
target proteins leading to cardiac hypertrophy. Activation of NHE1
can modulate Ca2+-dependent prohypertrophic signaling via changes
in [Na+]i and pHi. The cytoplasmic domain of NHE1 appears to play 2
important roles in this regulation: 1) regulation of NHE1 activity by re-
ceiving upstream input signals and 2) downstream transmission of the
ionic signal. This second role as a signal platform appears to be at-
tributable to the distal cytoplasmic domain. Indeed, in contrast to
the membrane-proximal cytoplasmic region, the distal region of
NHE1 with ~130 residues (aa 686–815) is nonconservative among
NHE isoforms, is intrinsically disordered [139], and does not have a
great impact on the exchange activity [140]. Speciﬁc intervention
between NHE1 and target molecules may be useful as a new thera-
peutic strategy against heart failure because this intervention does
not inhibit the basal exchange activity, which would be needed for
physiological maintenance of ionic homeostasis.
