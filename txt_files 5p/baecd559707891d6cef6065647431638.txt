Social-Cognitive Neuroscience: An fMRI 
Study on the Neural Mechanisms of Self-
Other Differentiation 

Study Project 

First Meeting 

October 15, 2014 

 

PD Dr. Markus Quirin (mquirin@uos.de) 

Elise Radtke, M.Sc. (eradtke@uos.de) 

Intro to the Topic 

Social-Cognitive Neuroscience: An fMRI Study on the 
Neural Mechanisms of Self-Other Differentiation 

Prerequisites 

At least one: 

 Most important: Matlab knowledge 

 

(SPM toolbox will be used) 

 Secondly important: Statistics Knowledge 

 

(preferably SPSS, but R is possible) 

 Nice-to-have: (Cognitive/Personality) Psychology Knowledge 

 min. 2 German speaking people (Experiment will be done 

with German-Speaking people etc.) 

 

But in any case: 

 Interest in the topic! 

 Willingness to acquire the knowledge 

      (by self-and-group-study)!

Neural Mechanisms of Self-Other Differentiation 

Regulations 

 Decided to participate? → Register in the stud.ip group                                              

“Social-Cognitive Neuroscience: An fMRI Study on the Neural Mechanisms of Self-Other Differentiation” 

 



 

12 ECTS per semester 

=~ min. 6h work per week per person 

 

 Group meetings at least once a week 

To discuss what has been done, 

•
 
• Send a protocol of the meeting to Markus or Elise 

and what will be done next 

 

 we (Markus or Elise) will join once in a while and when you need help 

 





you can work in Room 301 (Matlab, SPSS & SPM, Office etc. installed) 
data, scripts etc. are stored on our Lab server; after you confirm to take part in the 
study project, you will get access to the server; which you can also access from any 
other computer 

 

 Grade: 

•
•
•

writing the protocol should be everybody’s turn after one another (25%) 
giving one group presentation per semester in the Neurolab Labmeeting (25%) 
writing a Report as a group at the end of each semester (50%)

What was done in the last study project? 

 The Self-Infiltration task was changed, so that it can be done in the 

scanner, e.g.: 

• more verb-noun compounds (tasks) were created, because a high 

number of trials is needed inside the scanner 

• Screen-paradigm-adaption: we don’t give paper-pencil-lists to the 

participants in the scanner 

• > Implementation in Eprime 

 9 participants were measured in the Marburger MRT 

 Verification, that the paradigm is usable in the MRT 

• successful: visual activity, when signal is averaged over all item 

categories 

 first Analysis of the Data 

• some contrasts 

• one (out of some possible) ANOVAs (and ANCOVAs)

Goal of this study project 

First Semester (Oktober-March) 
 
1.

fMRT-Analysis: 

        redo the GLM modellation of the preprocessed data 

•  
 

the last study project did not model the “remaining items” 
cateogory; but this definetely needs to be done! 

        another ANOVA/ANCOVA: using the preprocessed 9 participants:  

•

•
•

•

•

also modelling inconsistent items, because we did not do 
that until now 

At least two additional ANOVAs 
Maybe contrasts again? > find out: Contrast versus 
ANOVA? 

Include covariate “Emotion Regulation” 

Maybe: include other factors into the analysis (number of 
infiltrated items as covariate, …) 

        Goal: 

•

•
•

•

•

understand the experiment and data as such 

get used to Matlab & SPM, and fMRI Analysis as such 
get used to SPSS 

see pitfalls, and get other ideas about how to further 
improve the experiment 

last BUT not least: find new interesting effects 
 

2.

Improve paradigm, e.g.: 

•
•

Xxx 
Xxx 
 

3. Re-Implement in EPrime 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

Second Semester (April-September) 

 

4.

5.

6.

 

Measuring ca. 10 more 
participants in Marburg 
 

 

 

 

Analysing the data, starting from 
the raw data 

Reporting results 

Any additional things are possible: 

 

Additional analyses (e.g. including other 
covariates, or the task ratings, …)
