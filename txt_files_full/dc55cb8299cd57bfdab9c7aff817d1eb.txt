Abstract Species that colonise habitats on an annual basis are important for studying and
understanding evolutionary changes and adaptations in the course of environmental shifts,
caused, for instance, by global change phenomena. These species are characterised by a
weedy ecology enabling them to react fast to environmental changes. As a model species,
we selected Capsella bursa-pastoris (Brassicaceae, Shepherd’s Purse), which is annual to
biennial, predominantly selﬁng and closely related to the genetic model plant Arabidopsis
thaliana. Differentiation and adaptation in C. bursa-pastoris are shortly reviewed. Based
on this knowledge, two Botanical Gardens are currently arranging long-term sites char-
acterised by annual ploughing for the genetic monitoring of C. bursa-pastoris. Demo-
graphic parameters will be monitored as well, i.e. different life-cycle phases such as
ﬂowering, fruiting, and the soil seed bank. Furthermore, seeds of at least 20 individuals
will be sampled per year. Isozyme analyses, ﬂow cytometry, AFLPs, SNPs as well as
microsatellites will be utilised to characterise changes in genetic diversity patterns over
time. In general, the objective of our genetic monitoring of C. bursa-pastoris is to address
the following questions: In the light of future research, our objectives are to study whether
the genetic structure and diversity of C. bursa-pastoris alter over time, whether a possible
invasion of ecotypes/genotypes of Sheperd’s purse is traceable using genetic markers, and
whether it is possible to relate variation in reproductive patterns to respective candidate
genes, which may be useful for monitoring.

Introduction

Colonising species play an important role in evolutionary studies because they provide
convenient experimental material and often exhibit rapid evolutionary change (see for
instance Baker 1974; McNeill 1976; Brown and Marshall 1981; Silvertown and Charles-
worth 2007). In particular, ruderal plants and agricultural weeds are characterised by high
phenotypic plasticity and genetic adaptability, optimally adapted to open disturbed habitats
(Adahl et al. 2006). As such, these plants are good target and model species for analysing
adaptations to changing environmental conditions (cf. Hurka and Neuffer 1991; Pigliucci
and Noah 1998).

Consequences of recent climatic changes on plant distributions and on natural systems
in general, are already recognisable worldwide (Parmesan and Yohe 2003; Root et al.
2003; Walther 2008). Many plants of predominantly Mediterranean to sub-Mediterranean
origin, most notably agricultural weeds (cf. Essl and Rabitsch 2002), have expanded in
like Crambe hispanica
distribution range and are immigrating into Central Europe,
(Bernhardt and Laubhann 2006), Diplotaxis erucoides and Capsella rubella (Bernhardt
et al. 2008) into Austria. Also, Central European winter annuals have already been
observed forming a second generation within one year, and summer annuals persist
throughout the winter until the next vegetation season, or the differentiation between
summer and winter annuals has disappeared completely, at
locally/regionally
(Bernhardt, personal observation).

least

To analyze both, (i) the spreading of plant species and/or their ecotypes/genotypes in
relation to ongoing environmental change, and (ii) the impact of this colonisation process
on the gene pool and population structure, long-term biomonitoring experiments are highly
desirable. Here, we propose species of the genus Capsella (Brassicaceae) as appropriate
model plants, and outline adequate experiments. Capsella bursa-pastoris is listed as one of
the most common plants on earth (Coquillat 1951; Zhou et al. 2001), and biosystematic
aspects of Capsella species are well studied, as will be shown below.

Our study questions include the following:

(1) How do the genetic structure and diversity of C. bursa-pastoris alter over time and to

(2)

what extent is such a change related to ecological factors?
Is a possible invasion of ecotypes/genotypes of C. bursa-pastoris preferring warmer
climate conditions, and/or of its close relative C. rubella traceable using genetic
markers?

123

(3) Can we relate variation in reproductive patterns to respective candidate genes which

may then be used for monitoring?

Capsella as a model for long-term monitoring experiments

The genus Capsella

Capsella Medikus is a small genus within the mustard family (Brassicaceae) closely
related to the genetic model plant Arabidopsis (DC.) Heynh. (Franzke et al. 2009; German
et al. 2009). Capsella comprises a few species but no clear cut species concept exists. For
our present purposes we have adopted a rather conservative view and recognize three
species which differ in ploidy level, breeding system, and distribution range. Capsella
grandiﬂora (Fauche´ and Chaub.) Boiss. and C. rubella Reut. are both diploids with
2n = 2x = 16 (Fig. 1, photos upper part). C. grandiﬂora is an obligate outbreeder; its
genetically based self-incompatibility system (SI) has been recently characterized at the
molecular level (Paetsch et al. 2006). The distribution range of C. grandiﬂora is restricted
to Albania and western Greece, and additionally the species has been locally introduced to
northern Italy. The other diploid species, Capsella rubella, is self-compatible (SC) and a
phylogenetically young derivative of C. grandiﬂora in which the SI system broke down
(Foxe et al. 2009; Guo et al. 2009). Coinciding with the transition from SI to SC, C. rubella
widened its range from the European Mediterranean to nearly all Mediterranean climatic
regions worldwide (Fig. 1 upper part).

The tetraploid Capsella bursa-pastoris (L.) Medik. (2n = 4x = 32) is predominantly
inbreeding and characterized by greatest colonising ability (Hurka and Neuffer 1997;
Hurka et al. 2003). It is one of the most wide-spread ﬂowering plants on earth (Coquillat
1951) and is regarded as the second most common weed worldwide (Zhou et al. 2001). It
originated in Eurasia and spread to the New World and Australasia/New Zealand only in
historic times with European colonists (Fig. 1, lower part, greatly supported by mucilag-
inous seeds––dispersal via myxospermy, photos lower part).

The occurrence and habitat range of the three species overlap within the respective
species speciﬁc distribution areas, and they may even occur together in one and the same
population. Natural hybrids have been observed between C. grandiﬂora and C. rubella, and
between C. rubella and C. bursa-pastoris. The latter hybrid, described as C. gracilis Green
in the literature, is triploid and sterile but backcrosses and introgression of characters from
one species into the other are possible (Slotte et al. 2006, 2008).

Recently, range expansion of C. rubella towards the north has been observed (Jalas
et al. 1996; Bernhardt et al. 2008). In Germany records of this species are consistently
increasing in number (e.g., Bomble, personel communication; Hurka unpublished).
However, the determination of C. rubella is critical and has to be veriﬁed by ploidy levels
or isozyme analyses because all morphological characters of C. rubella are within the
phenotypic variability of C. bursa-pastoris. Nevertheless, given this recent range expan-
sion, C. rubella may act as a biological key indicator for climate change.

Differentiation and adaptation in Capsella bursa-pastoris

It has been shown that the life history traits of C. bursa-pastoris exhibit a complex variation
pattern characterised by a multitude of interacting factors, and therefore, patterns of

123

Fig. 1 Distribution ranges of the three Capsella species. Inset upper part: C. grandiﬂora is characterised
by large petals, C. rubella by small petals. Inset lower part: C. bursa-pastoris is characterised by the ability
of long-distance dispersal by myxospermy as an adaptation to epizoochory and has successfully colonised
nearly all regions of the world in historical times

variation in the wild may often be patchy and random. The overall phenotypic variation
revealed macro geographic patterns (Fig. 2, Table 1) superimposed by patchiness
depending partly on microhabitat conditions (e.g., ﬁeld versus trampled habitats, Neuffer
and Meyer-Walf 1996). These micro geographic patterns were often reﬂected in sharp
differentiation among some local populations within a particular geographic region (Fig. 3).
However, climatic, edaphic, biotic, and historical factors strongly interplay with each other
and variation can be inﬂuenced randomly by genetic drift, which plays an important role in
small local populations. Population variability of C. bursa-pastoris may also be inﬂuenced
by the soil seed bank and may depend on the disturbance of the habitat (Bosbach et al. 1982;
Hurka and Haase 1982; Hurka and Neuffer 1991). Nevertheless, C. bursa-pastoris displays
ecotypic variation as reviewed by Hurka and Neuffer (1997) and Table 1.

For short-lived colonising plants, germination and the start of ﬂowering are important
ﬁtness traits. In cases of bad timing of germination and ﬂowering the individual plant risks
death or at least reproduction failure.

The germination strategy of C. bursa-pastoris has been intensively studied (Neuffer and
Hurka 1988; Baskin and Baskin 1989; Baskin et al. 2004). Some populations revealed
pronounced temperature optima for germination capacity; others germinated equally well
over the entire temperature range. This indicates genetic heterogeneity between and also
within populations. However, no correlation between germinability and any environmental
pattern has been established so far (Neuffer and Hurka 1988; Neuffer and Bartelheim 1989;
Hurka and Neuffer 1991). Our data suggest that germination of C. bursa-pastoris in the
ﬁeld is mainly regulated by factors contributing to the inception and breaking of dormancy,
which depend on preharvest (maternal effects, Neuffer and Koch 1996) and postharvest
conditions. Since dormancy inception and release is highly inﬂuenced by environmental
factors, this appears to be a satisfactory way to regulate seedling emergence, in time and
space, for Capsella, which occupies a wide range of soil types and climatic conditions and

123

which has to cope with the unpredictability of its habitats. Such a strategy comes close to a
‘‘general–purpose genotype’’. However, it would appear that endogenous yearly activity
rhythms are also involved (Neuffer and Schultes 1990). In Fig. 4 the germination strategy
over a period of one year is shown. Samples were sown every second week at 5°C (night)/
25°C (day) and 9 h photoperiod in a growth chamber. Even under controlled conditions
germination capacity showed obvious differences over the year which might point to an
endogenous rhythm in connection with seed dormancy effects (see also Baskin and Baskin
1989; Baskin et al. 2004). This may be one reason for the ‘‘intermittent germination’’
strategy detected by Salisbury (1963) for Capsella.

It appears from open-ﬁeld and growth chamber experiments that Capsella bursa-pas-
toris displays intraspeciﬁc genetic variation in the time required before ﬂowering. Genetic

adaptations of certain traits to local ecological conditions were evident. Populations also
varied in the amount and pattern of plasticity, and it appeared that phenotypic plasticity
may also be controlled by selection. There is pronounced ecotypic variation in time to
ﬂowering between ‘‘early’’ and ‘‘late’’ genotypes (summarized in Table 1).

Flowering of C. bursa-pastoris is basically inﬂuenced by temperature conditions
(Steinmeyer et al. 1985; Neuffer and Hurka 1986) and by day length (Hurka et al. 1976). It
might be assumed that vernalisation sensitive ﬂowering time genes (e.g. FLC or FRI,
Lempe et al. 2005; Shindo et al. 2006) are responsible for ecotypic differentiation in
Capsella. The results of Slotte et al. (2007), however, showed that FLC is not as important
for their Capsella data set as compared to A. thaliana (Lempe et al. 2005; Shindo et al.
2006). Therefore, these authors concluded, ‘‘that genes involved in regulation of the cir-
cadian clock, such as CCA1 and TOC1, are strong candidates for the evolution of adaptive
ﬂowering time variation in C. bursa-pastoris’’.

In Capsella, Linde et al. (2001) mapped a population created by crosses between an early
and a late ﬂowering ecotype. 13 phenotypic characters were explained by 48 QTLs; three of
them explaining the variability for the character ‘‘onset of ﬂowering’’. Ceplitis et al. (2007)
repeated this experiment with AFLP markers instead of RAPDs and they were able to establish
ﬂowering time genes known from the model plant A. thaliana (Fig. 5). All these mapped genes
(GA1, LD6, FCA, FRI) are located on chromosome number IV in A. thaliana. However, in

Capsella these genes were located on various linkage groups indicating chromosomal
re-arrangements which are generally known in comparison of Arabidopsis lyrata and
C. rubella (Koch and Kiefer 2005). Epigenetic effects may also be involved in ﬂowering time
variation in Capsella as has been detected, for instance, in Arabidopsis (Shindo et al. 2006).

Ongoing reciprocal transplantation experiments

Recently, a reciprocal transplantation experiment with about 200 lines representing more
than 20 provenances originated from across Europe has been established (Fig. 6). Utilised
Capsella lines are characterised by a known isozyme multilocus genotype. Based on
harvested seeds of sister material ripened under these different environmental conditions,
conclusions on epigenetic or maternal effects inﬂuencing the ﬂowering behaviour will
become possible.

To get deeper insights into the adaptation strategy of a successful colonising taxon in a
changing world, a long-term ﬁeld experiment at various sites is highly desirable. In two of
the above-mentioned ﬁeld sites (see Fig. 6, Vienna and Osnabrueck) such experiments
already started and scientists responsible for two more ﬁeld stations expressed their interest
in this cooperation (Kuopio, Finland; Barnaul, Russia). Furthermore, our experiment will
offer the opportunity to observe within-species shifts of ecotypes under speciﬁc regional
conditions, which are so far largely neglected.

Outline of monitoring experiments on permanent plots: phenotypic studies

In Vienna and Osnabrueck we established a 10 9 10 m2 experimental ﬁeld inoculated with
the 200 Capsella lines mentioned above. In Vienna, demographic parameters will be
monitored, i.e. different life-cycle phases. Therefore, dates of ﬁrst ﬂowering and harvesting
will be reported as well as later in the respective vegetation season, how many plants are still
ﬂowering and/or fruiting. We will also include soil seed bank samples from the permanent
plots in our analysis, as the seeds stored in the soil likely act as a source for (selected)
speciﬁc above-ground genotypes (e.g., Cabin 1996; Manda´k et al. 2006). Seeds of 20
individual plants will be harvested and subsequently the plots will be ploughed once a year
to create open soils. The seed material will be stored at minus 20°C (equipment is available
in Osnabrueck and Vienna). For subsequent genetic analyses plants will be grown from the
seeds harvested under standardised conditions (in greenhouses) and speed of germination
and times of the ﬁrst ﬂowering will be reported. As the species under study are characterised
by a high selﬁng rate (between 80 and 99%), seed material therefore mirrors on one hand the
respective origin of genotypes and on the other hand the degree of outcrossing.

Outline of monitoring experiments on permanent plots: genetic studies

For the genetic characterisation during the long-term monitoring studies we would like to
perform at least three different studies:

At ﬁrst, detection and discrimination of diploid C. rubella individuals from tetraploid
C. bursa-pastoris individuals will be done using ﬂow cytometry (Dolezel et al. 2007)
utilising Petroselinum crispum (Apiaceae) characterised by a DNA content of 4.46 pg
(cf. Yokoya et al. 2000) as an internal standard (Fig. 7).

provenances. Two of these ﬁelds will already form part of the ten years genetic monitoring experiment. Above

Russia, below left BOKU Vienna, Austria, below right Nagens near Flims 2200 m a.s.l., Switzerland

Secondly, we would like to use isozyme analysis as a taxonomic tool (Fig. 8). The
analyses should be carried out for one offspring of each of the 20 sampled individuals per
year and experimental plot by polyacrylamid gel electrophoresis following the protocols of
Hurka et al. (1989) for AAT, Hurka and Neuffer (1997) for LAP, and Hurka and Du¨ring
(1994) for GDH. The enzyme AAT (aspartate amino transferase; EC 2.6.1.1) is a dimeric
enzyme encoded by three nucleic loci but expressed in different cell compartments. The
LAP (leucine aminopeptidase; EC 3.4.11.1) is a monomeric enzyme and is encoded by
three loci in diploid Capsella species (Hurka and Neuffer 1997). The GDH (glutamate
dehydrogenase; EC 1.4.1.4) is homohexameric, and two loci could be analyzed for diploid
Capsella species (Hurka and Du¨ring 1994). All loci are duplicated in the tetraploid

123

Biodivers Conserv

Fig. 7 Based on ﬂow cytometry different genome sizes of Capsella species are detectable. G1 and G2 show
the genome sizes during different stages of the cell cycle during mitosis of C. rubella and C. bursa-pastoris,
respectively. As a standard (G3) we used Petroselinum crispum. For this analysis fresh leaf material was
used. The experiment was performed by Carina Titel, Osnabrueck, Germany

C. bursa-pastoris (Hurka and Neuffer 1997). Isozyme multilocus genotypes display geo-
graphic distribution patterns, and may trace colonisation history (Hurka and Neuffer 1997;
Neuffer and Hurka 1999; Neuffer et al. 1999). Some of the isozyme loci are linked to
‘‘onset of ﬂowering’’ QTL (Linde et al. 2001) and, therefore, isozymes appear as promising
tools for recording changes in genotype frequencies.

Thirdly, we would like to establish AFLPs, SNPs closely related to ﬂowering time
genes, and microsatellites. As C. rubella is presently included in a genome sequencing
project (www.jgi.doe.gov/sequencing/why/3066.html) we may have the opportunity to
develop suitable markers close to the adaptive trait ‘‘start of ﬂowering’’ which is of high
importance for the successful colonisation of new habitats and for changing ecotypic
compositions in times of global change.

the ten years genetic monitoring experiment. As an example one picture of a LAP gel with C. grandiﬂora,
C. rubella, C. bursa-pastoris, and C. gracilis, the hybrid between C. rubella and C. bursa-pastoris, is shown

In general, within-species differentiation will be characterised and with new molecular
methods (e.g., respective SNPs) we should be able to differentiate between individual
genotypes during the coming years.

The differences between the molecular genotypic compositions at each experimental
station over at least ten years of monitoring could be an excellent possibility to observe
ongoing intraspeciﬁc biodiversity changes in a climatically changing world.

Conclusions

Several studies (see for instance, Thomas et al. 2004) elucidated possible consequences of
global change on biological diversity. These include range expansion (e.g., Walther et al.
2007, Trachycarpus fortunei within the lower forest zone of the European Alps),

123

Biodivers Conserv

hybridisation between invasive and native species (e.g., Bleeker and Matthies 2005,
Rorippa species in Germany), and shifts in ﬂowering times (e.g. Parmesan and Yohe
2003). Although each of these investigations is needed for a better understanding of the
various inﬂuences of global change on biodiversity, the predictability of future develop-
ments of life on earth still seems to be limited. In particular, little is known about the
intraspeciﬁc (genetic) changes caused by climatic shifts (cf. Root et al. 2003). Sheperd’s
purse is particular useful for climatic change studies as this species is one of the most
common ﬂowering plants in the world, has a short life cycle, and its adaptation to various
climatic environments is well studied. Beyond that the species is closely related to the
genetic model plant A thaliana and therefore an enormous number of molecular genetic
tools are available. In our experimental setting we are planning to study these intraspeciﬁc
details, i.e. the shifting of within-species variability based on a long-term study. The
importance of random effects and sampling errors may therefore decrease compared to
snap-shot studies describing genetic patterns within a single year, and the predictability for
the future processes and the generalisation for advanced questions may be strengthened.
Therefore, we will build up a network of Botanical Gardens interested in joining the
present experimental approach. For further details on joining the present experimental
approach, contact Karl-Georg Bernhardt.
