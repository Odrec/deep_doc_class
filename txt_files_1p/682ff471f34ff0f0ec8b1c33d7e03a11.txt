pates the Holocaust; Wallace Stevens’s short
poem of 1942, “The man on the dump,”

Miller has inﬂuenced several generations
of critics. He describes his vocation as the
responsibility to account for literary works
by teaching them or by writing essays about
them that are attentive to their linguistic
complexities, to what might be called their
“rhetoric.”

copied or represented. This is not to say
