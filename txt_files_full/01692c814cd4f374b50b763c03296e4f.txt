Outline

● Introduction
● Typical stages in lexical development
● Individual differences in lexical development
● Aspects of word learning
● Summary

 

 

Introduction

● Average amount of words (English speakers)

● in a first grader's mental lexicon: 14 000 words
● In a college student: 150 000 words

● Contents of a mental lexicon:
● Sound of the word (phonetics)
● Grammatical category
● Word meaning (semantics)

 

 

Introduction

● Development of a mental lexicon:

● Speech segmentation
● Word-referent mapping 
● Remembering the phonetical form of a word
● Semantic organization of the mental lexicon

● Word learning is a phonological, cognitive and 

linguistic process

 

 

Typical stages in lexical 

development

Comprehension vocabulary
● ca. 5 months: recognition of own name
● ca. 8 months: understand few simple sentences
● 8-10 months: understand individual words
● ca. 16 months: 92-321 words

 

 

Typical stages in lexical 

development

Production vocabulary
● Protowords

● Apparently consistenst meaning for the child
● Not derived in any obvious way from the target 

language 
● First words

● Approximations of words in the target language
● Usually context-bound (prelexical)
● Sometimes referential
● More nouns than verbs

 

 

Typical stages in lexical 

development

● 10-15 months: production of first words
● Average of 8-11 new words per month, which 
are not necessarily permanently added to the 
mental lexicon

● 18 months: 50 words mile stone
● Word spurt

● Its existence is controversely discussed

● 22-37 new words per month, often learned after 

single exposure

● 18 months – 6 years: avg. 9 new words per day

 

 

Typical stages in lexical 

development

Higher percentage of verbs in comprehension 
vocabulary compared to production vocabulary
Comprehension vocabularies grow faster than 
production vocabularies
Comprehension precedes production, however 
some words can be produced before they are 
(fully) comprehended
Processing of speech speeds up at 15-25 months 
(→ looking-while-listening)

 

 

Individual differences in lexical 

development

● Ratio of referential words to context-bound 

words
● Contextual learning as opposed to learning by 
explicit defintions causes acquisition of context-
bound words

● Analytic approach favours referential words over 

context-bound words (in contrast to holistic 
approach)

● Cautious children produce fewer referential words 

while very social children may be prone to use 
words of which they have an incomplete 
understanding 

 

 

Individual differences in lexical 

development

● Ratio of nominals to personal/social words

● Referential children are more likely than average to 

be the firstborn of college-educated parents 
– Children are taught labels explicitly, because their 

parents are inclined to do so and also have the time for it

● Some children use language to refer to objects, 

others for social interaction

 

 

Individual differences in lexical 

development

● Speed

● Factors which favor faster lexical development:

– Higher socioeconomic status: richer vocabulary and more 

exposure to speech

– Birth order: firstborns experience more one-to-one 

interaction with an adult

– Informativeness of context
– Responsiveness of social environment (<18 months)

● Related to child's personality

– Faster language processing and better phonological 

memory

– Sex differences

 

 

Aspects of word learning

● Speech segmentation

● By recognizing recurrent sound sequences
● Using stress and rhythm cues (language specific)
● Using phonotactic cues (language specific)
● Special characteristics of child-directed speech 

(short sentences + small variety of words)

● Word-referent mapping

● Word meaning is indeterminate
– Evidence for initial fast mapping
– Method of elimination 

 

 

Aspects of word learning
– Lexical constraints (whole-object assumption + 

assumption of mutual exclusivity)

– Pragmatic principles

● Principle of conventionality
● Principle of contrast

– Intentionality assumption
– General processes of attention and learning
– Parent's help (finding the referents + corrections)
– Cross-situational information
– Syntax (Syntactic bootstrapping hypothesis) 

● Problem of word extension

kind)

 

– Taxonomic assumption (words refer to things of the same 

– Function/purpose & appearance of objects

 

Aspects of word learning

● Remembering the phonetical form of a word

● Learning a sound sequence and learning its 

meaning does not necessarily happen at the same 
time

● Prior exposure to a sound sequence facilitates 

learning its meaning 

● Semantic organization of the mental lexicon

● Problem: Words do not always map exactly onto 

concepts
– Children may have concepts for which there is no word in 

their language and thus make up their own words

 

– There is not a word for each conceptually available 

 

distinction

Aspects of word learning

● Aquiring a language 

specific lexicon
– In Spanish, motion verbs 
tend to encode direction 
(salir - exit) rather than 
manner, as is commonly 
done in English (run out)
– In Korean, as opposed to 

English, there are 
different verbs for 
spontaneous and caused 
motion, and the direction 
of motion is part of the 
meaning of the verb

 

 

Summary

● Lexical development is the process of learning 
the words in the target language and organizing 
them in the mental lexicon

● There is evidence for a word spurt after the first 

50 words at around 18 months

● The content of early vocabularies depends on 

the properties of the language and its 
sociocultural uses

● The task of word-learning includes speech 

segmentation, word-referent mapping, 
remembering the phonetical form of a word, 
and semantic organization of the mental lexicon
