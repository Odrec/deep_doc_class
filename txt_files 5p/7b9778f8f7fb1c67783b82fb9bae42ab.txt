Main experimental evidences and theoretical models, currently used
to describe the modiﬁcation of dielectric materials by swift-heavy ion
(SHI) beams, operating in the electronic stopping regime, are
reviewed. The emphasis is on the interplay and synergy between
point defects and amorphous tracks. This implies a change of focus
from purely thermal approaches to those based on the generation
and accumulation of irradiation-induced defects followed by some
type of lattice collapse and structural change. To that end special
attention has been paid to experiments performed at electronic
stopping powers around the threshold value for track formation. In
particular, approaches based on the non-radiative decay of self-
trapped excitons (STEs) have been more extensively discussed. The
discussion is illustrated by dealing in some detail a few speciﬁc
materials such as alkali halides (NaCl), SiO2 and LiNbO3 where STEs
are, or very likely, ascertained. The review stresses the connection
between the SHI-induced effects and those caused by femtosecond
laser pulse irradiations. Moreover, electronic effects on SiO2 materials
are discussed due to their technological relevance and because they
offer an example of the interplay between thermal and excitonic
effects. Finally,
irradiation for various
technologies, with particular emphasis on photonics, is discussed.

1. General introduction

Light ions (mostly H and He) with energies in the MeV range are now a standard tool for the
analysis and characterization of materials, components and devices [1,2],
including objects of
archaeological or artistic relevance [3,4], as well as biological [5], and environmental [6] samples.
On the other hand, ion bombardment, together with ion implantation, offers a universal procedure

F. Agulló-López et al. / Progress in Materials Science 76 (2016) 1–58

to modify materials and tailor their properties according to speciﬁc functional demands. Until
recently, most studies have used light ions (H, He), and occasionally C, O and N, in a low energy region
near the end of the trajectory, where the dominant mechanism for structural modiﬁcations are the
elastic nuclear collisions with the atoms of the target material. As a consequence of that research
effort, relevant applications in microelectronics and photonics have been developed that rely on the
compositional and structural modiﬁcations induced by, either, the irradiation or the implantation of
the projectile ions [7–13]. For microelectronics the most popular application is impurity doping of
semiconductors by ion implantation, routinely used in industrial processes. More recently, a novel
fabrication technique for the production of functional ﬁlms has been developed using ion implantation
(e.g. He) on crystalline bulk substrates. After later treatment the technique allows for the slicing of the
thin ﬁlms (smart cut method) [14]. Last but not least, energetic ions constitute a natural environment
in present and future nuclear technologies, including massive energy production by ﬁssion and fusion
reactors. In these technologies, structural and functional materials are subjected to enormous con-
straints associated to the deleterious effects of neutron, ions and gamma ray bombardment. For the
ﬁssion reactors technology, already operative since many years, one key problem is to minimize the
deleterious effects associated to the storage of the nuclear radioactive waste generated in the nuclear
plants. In fact, there is an intensive search for materials (ceramics and glasses) that may be safely used
to store and immobilize the nuclear waste [15,16]. The problem of irradiation damage to functional
materials is particularly demanding for the future fusion reactors using magnetic conﬁnement tech-
nology, given the high neutron ﬂuxes and temperatures reached during operation of the conﬁned
plasma [17]. Different, but also very demanding, material degradation problems, are foreseen for
the operation of the fusion chamber in the inertial fusion technology [18].

More recently, the research focus on the effects of ion bombardment has shifted and been extended
to cover heavy mass and high energy ions, referred to as swift heavy ions (SHI), corresponding to ener-
gies above some hundreds of keV per atomic mass unit [19–22] and mass numbers above A  15. This
deﬁnition is rather arbitrary and can be, only, taken as indicative for those ions whose electronic stop-
ping power Se is above 1 keV/nm and clearly dominant over the nuclear stopping power Sn. Fig. 1
illustrates the growth of the ﬁeld: the number of papers published on SHI effects during the last
ten years has increased by roughly a factor 10. The main impetus has been provided by specialized
laboratories such as the Grand Accélérateur National d’Ions Lourds (GANIL) in France or the GSI
Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research, in Germany, within Europe. More research laboratories,
using last generation electrostatic accelerators, are now involved in such type of studies, as
exempliﬁed by the Center for Micro-Analysis of Materials (CMAM), installed at Universidad Autónoma
de Madrid. Then, a rich variety of new scientiﬁc problems and technological possibilities has come up.

In fact, SHI pose new theoretical challenges to the understanding of the structural effects and damage
caused by ion beams. Unfortunately, as far as we know, a uniﬁed description of the phenomena trig-
gered by SHI is not available. For these ions, the largest fraction of the ion energy is deposited as elec-
tronic excitation and gives rise to a localized high density e–h plasma, whose role in the ﬁnal fate of
damage has not been, so far, sufﬁciently discussed. Actually, it has become increasingly clear that the
collision damage, at least in the case of dielectric materials, represents only a part of the whole story.
The fundamental physical problem for the swift ion damage is to understand the processes and mech-
anisms that convert that electronic excitation into structural modiﬁcations (disorder) of the irradiated
material. This electronic relaxation relies on the electron–lattice (phonon) coupling and constitutes a
fundamental problem in condensed matter physics [23,24]. These effects have been known since long
time for molecules and some speciﬁc materials, such as alkali halides, that are known to be sensitive to
purely ionizing radiation (radiolysis). It is now clear, that structural damage is, indeed, produced by
electronic excitation in many dielectric materials, such as a variety of oxides and semiconductors
(even metals), if one uses the right irradiation conditions, ion, energy, ﬂux and ﬂuence. This electronic
contribution to ion-beam damage has a number of peculiar features that are relevant for applications
and cannot be realized with ions in the nuclear regime. One main feature of SHI irradiation is that the
electronic damage region is often well separated from the region of nuclear damage and ion implan-
tation, allowing for a better control and spatial deﬁnition of the irradiated region. Moreover, the dam-
age region associated to every single projectile ion is very well localized in the transversal plane in the
form of a cylindrical track of nanometric diameter (referred to as damage or latent track) [19–22]. This
opens a number of possibilities for the nano-patterning of material surfaces, either directly or after
suitable chemical or laser treatments [13,25–28]. By adjusting the electronic stopping proﬁle inside
the material, one may fabricate a unique variety of photonic devices including planar waveguides
for visible and medium infrared light [29,30], channeled and ridged waveguides [13], integrated optics
devices at the microscopic scale [31] and nanometer-size ring resonators [32]. It should be remarked
that the involved electronic processes during SHI irradiation may be not essentially different from
those induced by ionization sources: light, X-rays, and electrons. However, the electronic excitation
rates are usually much higher in comparison with the conventional ionization sources. In fact, the con-
ditions prevailing for electronic ion-beam damage (mainly high excitation ﬂux) are close to those
operating during femtosecond (fs)-pulse laser irradiation [33,34]. The similarities between the two
types of processes are remarkable and may act as a synergic drive to the research in both ﬁelds.

The purpose of this review paper is to summarize the main experimental information about the
structural effects on dielectric materials produced by SHI irradiation, i.e. in the electronic stopping
regime, discuss the physical models proposed to understand them and point out new directions for
experimental and theoretical research. One peculiarity of our paper is to emphasize the interplay
between microscopic damage (point defects) and macroscopic damage (amorphous tracks). Conse-
quently, an important part of the information presented and discussed deals with the energy region
around the stopping power threshold for track formation. The main question to be addressed is,
whether and how, irradiation-induced point defects may contribute to track formation and its mor-
phology. In other words, our emphasis is on electronic mechanisms responsible for the generation
of point defects and their accumulation kinetics up to a ﬁnal stage where the lattice collapses. In par-
ticular, we have primarily focused on models based on non-radiative decay of self-trapped excitons.
Although the physical bases of those models have been reviewed in several classical books [23,24],
quantitative application to the experimental information gathered on several materials has been
recently made. The variety of materials taken in consideration is rather limited since detailed parallel
experimental information on both processes, exciton self-trapping and ion-beam damage, is almost
exclusively available for alkali halides, LiNbO3 and SiO2 (crystalline and amorphous). Nevertheless
we consider that this analysis will encourage researchers to look into other appropriate materials. This
approach is expected to complement previous reviews and monographs about light ion irradiations or
covering partial aspects and/or models dealing with SHI irradiations. Anyhow, we concentrate on basic
experiments, concepts and modeling, avoiding description of experimental techniques. A signiﬁcant
part of the discussed experimental evidence has been obtained in our CMAM laboratory in Madrid
[35]. A topic that would deserve further attention for future work, and that is remarked at several sites
of the review, concerns the parallelisms between the effects of SHI-beams and femtosecond-laser

pulses. Finally, some applied aspects of the subject will be shortly discussed at the end of the paper.
Special attention will be paid to applications in photonics, since they are not often considered and very
promising results have been recently obtained on the design and fabrication of optical waveguides and
waveguide devices. Although, relevant work on semiconductors (e.g. Si, InP, and Cu3N) [36–39], and
metallic materials [40,41] has been also reported and may offer a more complete picture about the
effects of SHI irradiation, these studies will not be covered in our review.

2. Processes triggered by electronic excitation

2.1. Ion–matter interaction: basic concepts and phenomena

Our analysis should start by brieﬂy reviewing the main concepts used to describe the energy trans-
fer from the projectile ion to the material. The topic is crucial for this review as the energy deposited in
the material is directly related to the generation of defects and structural modiﬁcations. It is a special-
ized topic in the border line between nuclear and condensed matter physics that has been extensively
reviewed [42–44]. Here, we will adopt a simplistic approach and the reader should consult the special-
ized literature to gain more insight into the problem. The two main mechanisms for energy loss are
elastic nuclear collisions and electronic excitation, whose relative importance depends on ion (mass,
charge) and energy. These loss mechanisms are described by the so-called stopping powers or more
properly stopping forces (either nuclear or electronic) that are deﬁned as the energy loss per unit length
of the trajectory, i.e. Sn,e = (dE/dz)n,e, E being the ion energy, z referring to the ion penetration and the
subindices n and e to nuclear and electronic processes, respectively. A complicating feature when try-
ing to determine the stopping powers as a function of depth, is that the effective charge associated to
the ion varies with velocity and it is continuously readjusting during its motion through the material.
A ﬁrst suggestion was made by Bohr [45] proposing that electrons whose orbital velocity is lower than
the ion velocity are stripped from the moving ion. Later on, different formulae have been developed to
⁄
estimate the effective charge Z
of the moving ion as a function of its velocity. In many cases the
Northcliffe formula [46], written in simpliﬁed form as,

Z=Z ¼ 1   expð v=Z2=3veÞ

ð1Þ

can be applied. The parameter ve in Eq. (1) stands for the Bohr velocity.

The main regimes included in the overall dependences of S = Sn + Se on ion energy E are schemat-
ically illustrated in Fig. 2 [47], for the case of Br irradiation on LiNbO3. The plot uses E/A (MeV/amu) for
scaling the ion energy. At the low energy end the nuclear stopping dominates, whereas at the higher
energies the stopping is mostly electronic. As a rule of thumb, one may assume that the maximum
nuclear stopping occurs at ion energies around 1 keV/amu, and the maximum values of Sn increases,

comparison the stopping power curves Se(z) and Sn(z) as a function of penetration depth are plotted on top.

roughly, in a linear way with the mass A of the projectile ion, reaching up to around 5 keV/nm for
A  200. On the other side, the maximum electronic stopping power (Bragg peak) appears at around
1 MeV/amu. For SHI, the electronic stopping powers are typically >1 keV/nm and reach up to
around 5 keV/nm for A  200. Much higher values can be obtained for cluster (molecular) ions,
e.g. Se  46 keV/nm for fullerenes at 30 MeV impinging on silicon.

With regard to the electronic stopping power, having speciﬁc relevance for this review, the main
qualitative features are: small energy loss per collision, and small (negligible) angular deﬂection.
Two main cases can be considered depending on whether the input ion velocity v0 is lower or higher
than the electron velocity ve in the atomic orbitals. When the ion velocity is lower than the velocities
of orbital electrons in the target atom (v0 < ve) the Lindhard, Scharff and Schiott (LSS) [48] and Firsov
[49] models, involving the formation of a quasi-molecule, are generally used. In particular the LSS
model leads to expression,

Z1 and Z2 being the charges of the projectile and target nuclei, respectively. It predicts a linear depen-
dence on velocity or, equivalently, a square-root dependence on energy, Se / E1/2 up to the energy
where a maximum stopping value is reached (Bragg peak). In the second (high energy) case i.e.
v0  ve, the Bethe-Bloch models based on a pure Coulomb interaction between a fully stripped ion
and the electrons of the target become adequate and predict a dependence, Se / ln E/E. The formula
for the rate of energy loss can be written,

N being the atomic density of the target. The factor Le depends on the electronic structure of the target
atom (i.e. its atomic charge) through a mean ionization energy I and it also includes a number of
relativistic corrections. The ratio I/Z2 is around 10 eV, essentially independent of Z, except for the
lightest atoms (Z2 < 15) where it may reach up to around 20 eV [50].

The trajectory of the bombarding ions inside the material is strongly dependent on its energy. For
low energies (<100 keV) where elastic collision processes are dominant, the trajectories present a zig-
zag pattern causing large random deviations from the initial straight direction, and so, a remarkable
straggling. On the other hand, for high energies (MeV range) i.e. in the electronic stopping regime
the trajectories keep essentially straight with small directional straggling. The situation is well

F. Agulló-López et al. / Progress in Materials Science 76 (2016) 1–58

appreciated in the SRIM simulations (see later) displayed in Fig. 3, that correspond to impinging Br
ions at 200 MeV on amorphous SiO2 (silica). For comparison, the electronic and nuclear stopping
power curves Se(z) and Sn(z) are shown on top of the ﬁgure to illustrate the different behavior of
the trajectories in the two stopping regimes.

An important parameter for the ion trajectory is the projected range R deﬁned as the distance
travelled by the ion projected along the input direction. Depending on the energy, i.e. on the stopping
regime, one has different range-energy dependences. However, a useful thumb rule is:

R ¼ CEc

ð4Þ
where C and c can be empirically determined [51]. For high non-relativistic energies, c  2 and it lies
between 1 and 2 in most other cases.

To calculate many features of the transport of ions through matter one may conveniently use SRIM,
that is a collection of software packages based on Monte Carlo numerical codes [52]. They use a binary
collision strategy and the material is considered to be amorphous (random atomic locations). More
sophisticated approaches are provided by molecular dynamics calculations [53–55], where many-
body interactions can be taken into account thanks to modern computers.

As a consequence of the elastic collisions of the bombarding ion with the target atoms point defects
can be generated. It is usually accepted that if the transferred energy T overcomes a certain threshold
value ED, or displacement energy, the knocked atom is ejected from its lattice position creating a
vacancy and an interstitial, i.e. a Frenkel pair [51,53,56]. This is the primary damage process in the
nuclear regime. To calculate the overall defect concentration produced by the ion bombardment
one has to take into account the secondary displacements caused by each primary displaced atom.
Taking into account the low range of the secondary displaced atoms within the crystal lattice, all of
them will be quite close to each other, forming a region of high structural disorder (displacement spike
or displacement cascade) [51,53].

The irradiated layer can be considered amorphous when the number of produced displaced atoms
(dpas) is around 1, corresponding to full atomic disorder. For ceramics the problem is of great rele-
vance in relation to the storage and immobilization of nuclear waste and has been dealt in a number
of review papers [15,16]. A variety of physical models, either using homogeneous or heterogeneous
nucleation have been proposed and are described in the quoted literature, although none of them
has universal validity. At the end of the range, where nuclear damage is the highest, ions have com-
pletely lost their energies and become implanted into the material [9–11]. The process of ion implan-
tation provides a universal means to dope the material with foreign atoms that is now routinely used
in the semiconductor industry. The coexistence of ion implantation and ion-beam damage makes this
near-stopping region rather complex, and showing different contributions to the radiation-induced
structural changes.

2.2. Electronic interactions

Let us, hereafter, focus on the role of electronic excitation as a source of structural modiﬁcations in
materials irradiated by SHI. The processes triggered by the initial electronic excitation during the pas-
sage of a fast (swift) ion through a material are summarily described next. The major direct cause of
energy loss for the incoming ion is the Coulomb electrostatic interaction with the electrons of the
material that, as a consequence, become excited into the conduction bands and behave, initially, as
ballistic electrons. These, also called delta electrons, mostly move in a direction perpendicular to
the ion trajectory because of kinematic constraints. The excited electrons interact among themselves
and consequently the electronic system undergoes a rapid thermalization process (within a few fem-
toseconds), whereas the atomic system remains essentially unperturbed. At a later stage, in the time
scale of lattice vibrations (10 14 to 10 13 s), electron–phonon interaction enters into play and energy
starts to be transferred from the electronic to the atomic system (electron–lattice relaxation). This
process raises the atomic temperature until the two subsystems (electrons and atoms) roughly reach
a thermal equilibrium. From here on, the two subsystems cool down, keeping thermal equilibrium,
until a ﬁnal stage is reached at room temperature. During this process electron–hole pairs can couple

8

and give rise to bound states (excitons) that can move coherently through the lattice or become
trapped at certain defects. Moreover, in certain crystal lattices (e.g. many oxides) the electron–phonon
interaction is strong enough to cause exciton self-trapping after signiﬁcant lattice relaxation
[23,24,53]. Finally, those self-trapped excitons (STEs) can recombine and annihilate either by light
emission or non-radiatively, defect production being one of the possible non-radiative channels. In
other words, either the thermal or the electronic excitation energy, may be sufﬁcient to break bonds
and displace atoms from their regular lattice sites. Consequently, defect generation can be one of the
outputs of this electron–lattice relaxation stage, although this is a poorly understood and controversial
part of the overall material damage story.

Each of the above steps in the process gives rise to certain radial energy distributions that will be,
now, brieﬂy discussed. Ignoring the possible damage events, one can focus on the energy transfer pro-
cess between the excited electrons and the lattice, assuming that an effective temperature can be
deﬁned for each subsystem (electrons and atoms). Then, researchers often use two coupled differential
equations that describe the temperature evolution of the two subsystems (see Section 2.4). The source
term in those equations is given by the initial energy distribution corresponding to the ballistic
electrons.

2.3. Radial proﬁle of energy associated to ballistic electrons

Primary (delta) electrons are excited through Coulomb interactions with the projectile ion. Most
authors dealing with this topic either use empirical or Monte Carlo approaches [57–59], which calcu-
late the dose or energy invested by the delta electrons as a function of radial distance r from the tra-
jectory. In particular, the paper by Waligórski et al. [59] reports Monte Carlo calculations for protons
between 0.1 and 1000 MeV in water and ﬁt the results with manageable analytical formulae. The work
uses Rutherford scattering for the ion–electron interaction, electron ejection normal to ion trajectory
and empirical expressions for the range-energy dependence of delta electrons in the medium. The
simulations yield energy (dose) distributions that concentrate within a small radius 1 nm around
the trajectory [57–60], depending on ion velocity (see Fig. 4). Authors proposed an analytical expres-
sion that adequately ﬁts the Monte Carlo results and can be expressed as,

DðrÞ / Z2

ð5Þ

v being the ion velocity and Rmax the maximum range of electrons in the medium. c is a parameter
related to the range–velocity relation for electrons. By using the Barkas effective charge Z* [61] the
resulting expressions are applied to describe the radial energy distribution for heavy ions in the
Bethe–Bloch regime. In terms of the stopping power, the suitable expression for a layer of thickness
dz is

DðrÞ / dE

ð6Þ

It is apparent that the range or width of the energy distribution is determined by the ion velocity,
being smaller the lower the velocity. Other alternative but similar expressions for D(r) in terms of the
stopping power are found in [62,63], illustrating the diversity of proposals made by different authors.
It is, often, useful to characterize the width of the distribution through the so called Waligorski radius
RW that includes 66% of the deposited energy.

The energy distribution for the delta electrons is the starting point (source term) for describing the
energy transfer to the lattice through electron–phonon interaction. In order to discuss this transfer,
the temporal evolution of the deposited energy density is also required. For simplicity, it is often
assumed that the time and radial dependences can be factorized in the form [59]

where b is an energy normalization factor and t0 is the delay time needed for the electrons to reach the
equilibrium distribution (10 15 s). The integration of D(r, t) over time and radial coordinate gives the
electronic stopping Se. More details of the analysis will be offered in Section 4.2 dealing with the ther-
mal spike model for track formation.

2.4. Electron–lattice coupling: the thermal spike

The evolution of the coupled electron–phonon system after the ion impact is, indeed, a formidable
problem and simpliﬁed approaches are required. In the standard thermal-spike approach, one deﬁnes
effective temperatures for both electrons and atoms after the passage of the bombarding ion. Leaving
aside theoretical subtleties, the approach allows to describe the evolution of the two subsystems
through the so-called two temperatures (2T) approach [64]. The ﬁnal objective is to compute the
radial proﬁle of the lattice temperature as a function of depth and time. The method, that is in the
basis of the thermal spike model for track formation (see Section 3.2), is not free of problems.
Aside from the difﬁculties associated to the deﬁnition of temperature in such short time scales, the
mathematical formulation presents some uncertainties, mostly related to the meaning and reliability
of the involved physical parameters. The energy of the projectile ion is transferred to the electron
system through the Waligorski source term (7), and then, the energy transport is described by the
classical heat transport equations (Fick’s law) for both electrons and atoms. Moreover, a coupling term
between the two subsystems is introduced to account for the energy exchange between them
(electron–phonon coupling). Since the energy ﬂux is essentially perpendicular to the projectile ion
trajectory one can use cylindrical coordinates and write the two coupled heat transfer equations in
the form [65–67]:

where T, C, and K denote, respectively, the temperatures, the speciﬁc heats and thermal conductivities
for electrons (sub-index e) and atoms (sub-index a). c is the electron–phonon coupling for the material
and D(r, t) stands for the spatial and temporal deposition proﬁle of the excitation energy generated by
the ion impact. In accordance with Eq. (7) it is described by a Gaussian time distribution and a radial
distribution D(r).

The use of that two-temperatures model heavily relies on the very extensive work performed by
Toulemonde and coworkers along a number of years (see [67] as an example). The parameters and
their temperature dependence for the lattice (phonon system) can be, in principle, obtained from
the literature. However, to propose meaningful expressions and values for the electronic transport
and coupling parameters in Eq. (8) is a hard task. In principle, the approach appears more suitable
for metals having a useful simple model to describe their thermal and transport properties (free elec-
tron model). It is has been argued [67] that a quasi-free electron model for the excited electron gas
(ignoring electron–atom interactions and the role of hole carriers) can be applied, even dealing with
band-gap materials (insulators). Within such free-electron approach the two transport parameters are
functions of temperature and might be expected to change during the evolution of the thermal
spike [68]. However, at high temperatures compared to the Fermi temperature (T  TF), as expected
in the hot spike, one may use the approximation corresponding to a classical gas of free particles,
Ce ¼ 3
2 NkB. This expression leads to Ce  1 J cm 3 K 1 for an electron density N of 5  1022 cm 3,
essentially corresponding to the atomic density.

On the other hand, the expression for the thermal conductivity of the electron gas writes.

De = vFle/3 being the thermal diffusivity, vF the Fermi velocity (EF ¼ ð1=2Þmv 2
F) and le the electron–
electron mean free path. This later parameter has a typical value around tens of nanometers that
follows a universal behavior as a function of the gap energy [69]. By using Eq. (9) one then, readily,
obtains, De  2 cm2 s 1, by taking, vF = 108 cm/s and le = 40 nm.

The electron–phonon coupling c in the free electron model, it is related to the electron–phonon

mean-free path k through

c ¼ Ce=se;ph ¼ CeDe=k2 ¼ Ke=k2

ð10Þ

The parameter k, that plays a key role for the analysis, is generally considered as free and determined
from a ﬁt to experiment. Using a large group of insulators, a reasonable empirical correlation between
the values of k and the band gap energy EG has been found [67] (see Fig. 5). One ﬁnds a decreasing
dependence on EG that, roughly, reaches a steady state at around k = 4 nm.

As an example of the predictions of the two-temperatures approach, we show in Fig. 6 the solutions
obtained by SiO2 (quartz) irradiated with Au at 200 MeV at different radial distances from the ion path
(see Ref. [70]). The graphs on the left and right sides of the ﬁgure, respectively, illustrate the evolution
of the temperatures for electrons and atoms, assuming that the sample was initially at RT. One sees
that the temperature rise for the electrons occurs during the ﬁrst 1–10 fs, whereas the heating of
the lattice occurs within 100 fs after the ion impact. The decay of the common temperature for the
two systems down to RT requires between 1 ps and 100 ps. This means that the cooling rates are
in the range of 1014 s 1, i.e. much higher than can be achieved by thermal cooling in a laboratory. This
fast quenching effect plays a relevant role in the thermal spike models for track formation to be
discussed in a later section. Note that the corresponding times for the evolution of the electronic
temperature are around two orders of magnitude shorter than for the atomic system. A useful code
to perform simulations with the two-temperatures approach is available (thermal spike code for
insulators, jean-paul.stoquert@phase.c-strasbourg.fr and marcel.toulemonde@ganil.fr).

Once the enhanced temperature reached during the spike is over, the standard steady-temperature
regime sets in. The carrier transport parameters should be the same as for the pristine material,
although one should, obviously, take into account the possible structural modiﬁcations and lattice
damage caused during the spike (see Section 4). On one side, electronic carriers may move coherently
(as a Bloch state) with a certain scattering time between successive collisions with phonons or defects.
They can also move by thermally assisted hopping following a random-walk type of motion. On the
other hand, excitons may become bound to some impurities or defects or even self-trap in the atomic
network forming self-trapped excitons (STEs). They are in many oxides the moving agents to transport
the excitation energy to the recombination sites and emit light (ionoluminescence). Finally, the con-
ﬁguration of the defects that may have been formed during the hot spike can reorder and adopt new
structures that are ﬁnally observed and, eventually, characterized.

2.5. Electronic processes during the spike: energy balance between the electron and phonon systems

The above analysis for the thermal spike in insulators ignores the existence of holes and e–h recom-
bination processes (mostly non-radiative) in the electronic sub-system. They should reduce the con-
centration of electrons and holes that determine the macroscopic parameters (C, K and c) of the
electronic system to be used in Eq. (8) and affect to the energy exchange between electrons and atoms.
The recombination processes can be expected to be relevant in the scale of times involved in the

generation and cooling of the spike, e.g. by multi-phonon-assisted recombination. The occurrence of
those processes has been inferred from ionoluminescence experiments [71], performed in connection
with the development and understanding of scintillation detectors. Fig. 7 illustrates how the IL emis-
sion yield on a NaI (Tl) scintillator (per unit ﬂuence) decreases with the mass of the projectile at a
given energy and it becomes largest for the lightest ion. The ﬂuence is not relevant since the recom-
bination centers (Tl+) leading to light emission are not generated by the irradiation. Similar curves
have been obtained for other inorganic and organic scintillator materials. Since that yield is, in prin-
ciple, proportional to the square of the electron (or hole) density generated by the ion impact, the data
have been interpreted in terms of non-radiative e–h recombination at the hot central region of the
thermal spike associated to the ion–material interaction [71]. Similar results have been reported for
the reduction in the pulse height yielded by a NaI (Tl) scintillator as a function of incident ion mass
[72]. In other words, it is proposed that for heavier ions, causing more signiﬁcant excitation and struc-
tural damage per impact, a larger fraction of the e–h pairs decay nonradiatively at or near the track
core and do not contribute to the luminescence emission or pulse height. Unfortunately, the dynamics
of these non-radiative recombination processes is not known and, therefore, it introduces a large
uncertainty in the two-temperature analysis of the spike. Therefore, a more rigorous analysis should
take into account the fate of the generated electrons together with their holes counterparts during the
spike. Anyhow, a number of competing electronic processes can also occur such as changing the
charge state of impurities and/or point defect formation.

In principle, it is generally accepted that the total number of e–h pairs that are generated
by an input ion of energy E on a dielectric material with electronic gap EG is roughly given by
Ne,h  E/I  E/((1 + x)EG), I  (1 + x)EG, with x between 1 and 2, being an effective ionization energy,
that ignores recombination effects [72,73]. This means that the energy stored as Coulomb potential
energy in the generated e–h pairs is, WC = Ne,h. EG  EEG/(1 + xEG), and represents a high percentage
(30–40%) of the total input energy of the bombarding ion. Of course, this energy is progressively
reduced as long as non-radiative recombination processes are considered. From the comparison to
experimental ionoluminescence yields it comes out that for heavy mass ions the number of available
pairs can decrease down to 0.01–0.1 from the above theoretical prediction. The above ﬁgures refer to
the ﬁnal values after cooling of the spike since it is not possible to predict the kinetics of pair
recombination during the spike. Therefore, the inﬂuence of those events on the evolution of the spike
temperatures (electronic and atomic) cannot be reliably assessed.

2.6. Electrostatic and pressure effects: Coulomb explosion and shock waves

In the above thermal spike approach, we have also ignored the electrostatic effects associated to
the initial ballistic displacement of the electrons that break the electrical neutrality along the ion
trajectory. The high positive charge generated at the track core implies a very high electric ﬁeld and
so, a high electrostatic energy. If the ﬁeld is high enough and the charge neutralization process is
sufﬁciently slow, such energy can be suddenly turned into kinetic energy of the atom system that
may explode and disintegrate (Coulomb explosion) [74–77]. The large atom velocities acquired by
the exploding atoms may produce track formation (amorphization), material damage, surface modiﬁ-
cation and particle ejection (sputtering). This electrostatic phenomenon involves additional energy
terms that have not been considered in Eq. (8) for the two-temperatures approach to the thermal
spike. An analysis of the atom and electron energy distributions caused by the Coulomb explosion
has been also discussed by Ryazanov [78]. According to his calculations, the temperature rise by
Coulomb explosion becomes higher that that derived from the thermal spike approach. Although
the subject is still pending of a deeper analysis, the key parameter to assess the validity of such model
is the charge neutralization time. From measurements of the Auger line shifts it has been estimated
that such time can be less than 1 fs [79], raising serious doubts on the relevance of the process.

Another related effect not considered in the coupled equations (8) for the two-temperatures model
is the generation of high static pressures and shock waves at the spike boundary. They appear as a
consequence of the impact of the incoming ion producing an abrupt change in the properties of
the material. MD simulations performed on silica demonstrate that shock waves modify the
medium-range order of that amorphous system, causing signiﬁcant structural changes such as the
ring-size distribution [80,81].

3. Structural effects of electronic excitation

3.1. General features

Let us, ﬁrst, remark that the structural effects associated to the electronic excitation by ion beams
are complex and not yet well understood. The disorder may include, both, atomic-size defects (point
defects), defect clusters and extended damaged (amorphous) regions. A clear example of the
coexistence of those types of damage can be found in the results obtained for some speciﬁc materials
(see Sections 5 and 6). In competition with the creation of such structural damage, closely related
annealing and recrystallization effects occur during SHI irradiation [82,83] and should be considered
for a complete understanding of the SHI effects.

Most studies of electronic damage have been carried out on dielectric, semiconductor and even
metallic materials. Dielectrics or wide band-gap materials will be the object of this review. For semi-
conductors and metals, some features of SHI damage are similar, but they will not be covered here.
In principle, the nature of the defects created by electronic damage may be expected to be similar
to that induced by elastic collision processes, although the available information is scarce and frag-
mentary. However, for some dielectrics the ﬂuences needed to achieve heavy damage and amorphiza-
tion can be substantially lower for electronic than for nuclear damage [84]. From a practical side, a
main problem in the studies of electronic damage is to separate in a reliable way the electronic con-
tribution from that associated to the elastic collision damage. As long as the electronic effects are
related to electronic energy deposition processes, i.e. to Se, whose dependence on the ion penetration
depth is quite different from that of nuclear collision damage, namely Sn, one expects different depth
distributions for the generated defects. Although this topic will be discussed later (Section 3.5) in
detail, the reader can, now, take a look to Fig. 15, illustrating the transversal multilayer structures gen-
erated by irradiation of a LiNbO3 sample. One sees broad dark layers corresponding to the electronic
damage together with a faint line at the end of the ion range and corresponding to the nuclear collision
damage. The clear separation of the two damage regions could be very relevant for irradiation of thin
ﬁlms since it is possible to generate electronic damage in them, whereas nuclear disorder may be
mostly induced in the supporting substrates. One should recall that nuclear damage is heavily

14

F. Agulló-López et al. / Progress in Materials Science 76 (2016) 1–58

intermixed with ion implantation often making difﬁcult to separate the effects of irradiation and
implantation.

In addition to the structural modiﬁcations (defects) in the bulk material, the electronic mechanisms
also induce sputtering from the surface of the target material. Here, also, new differential features are
associated to electronic processes. In particular, much higher sputtering rates than those induced by
nuclear collisions have been found for many dielectric materials [70]. Finally, electronic effects may
also be responsible for a number of physical effects such as enhanced diffusion, healing effects, and
atomic mixing [11,53]. Only marginal description of those effects will be made in this review.

The most clearly observable feature of ion-beam damage in the electronic stopping regime for
is the formation of heavily-
many insulator, semiconductor, metallic and polymeric materials,

trajectory of
ion
[19,22,25,38,41,85–91]. The ﬁrst observation of this type of feature was that of the damage induced
by ﬁssion fragments in mica using transmission electron microscopy [92], leading to the initial
denomination of ‘‘ﬁssion” or ‘‘nuclear” tracks. Since then, the occurrence of tracks by ion-beam irra-
diation has been successfully applied to charge-particles dosimetry and age determination of rocks
and minerals. Moreover, it has triggered a number of technological applications to high resolution
lithography and to fabrication of molecular ﬁlters (see Section 7). Illustrative examples of track images
obtained by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for several crystalline materials are shown in
Fig. 8 [87,88,90]. Most tracks present approximate cylindrical morphology, although they may adopt
deformed shapes for anisotropic crystalline materials, such GeS. The diameters are in the nanometer
range, the cross-section being an increasing function of the electronic stopping power. The track area
is often considered as a damage cross-section since it deﬁnes the damaged area by a single ion impact
and so the rate at which the material becomes damaged as a function of ﬂuence. In principle, tracks
extend in the material over depths related to the projected range of the bombarding ion, and for ener-
gies below the Bragg peak (in the ﬁnal stage of the trajectory) the diameters decrease on increasing
depth. They are more conﬁned and sharper than the displacement spikes caused by impacts in the
elastic collision regime. In addition to TEM, a variety of physical techniques have been also success-
fully used to observe and characterize, directly or indirectly, those tracks, including atomic force
microscopy (AFM), Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy in channeling conﬁguration (RBS/C), Moss-
bauer spectroscopy, optical (refractive index) methods, and small angle scattering of X rays or neu-
trons [25,93–101]. These techniques are based on the structural changes associated to the damaged
track and on the elastic strains associated to the amorphous inclusion inside the un-irradiated
material.

On the other hand, tracks are readily revealed after a chemical attack (etching) of the irradiated
face of dielectric and semiconductor samples [19,92,98,102–104]. Since the etching rate is very much
enhanced in the irradiated surface regions in comparison to the pristine material, tracks are easily
observed as dips or holes whose areas and depths depend on the etching agent and time. In other
words, this treatment excavates a nanopore at every track site that can be easily observed through
AFM, TEM, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The sizes (radius and depth) of the pores depend
on irradiation conditions, etching agent and etching time but generally are one or two orders of mag-
nitude larger than those corresponding to the original track cores. Fig. 9 shows tracks revealed after
irradiation of several materials, silica (a), LiF (b) and LiNbO3 (c), with SHI and observed after suitable
etching treatments. One notices the inﬂuence of the crystalline structure (anisotropy) on the shape of
the etched dips (LiF and LiNbO3). Moreover, for some crystals (LiNbO3) the stopping power Se also
plays a role on the morphology of etched tracks (not shown in Fig. 12). The applications of these
sub-micron scale features in several technological ﬁelds will be discussed in Section 7.

Another interesting consequence associated to the presence of tracks is a swelling of the irradiated
area at the sample surface [104–107], that can be readily measured with a proﬁlometer. The step
height, in the range of hundreds of nanometers, is found to be roughly proportional to the amount
of damage determined by RBS/C. In principle, this effect also occurs at the single track level and con-
sists of a protrusion or hillock, of nanometric height and radius, appearing at the impact point of the

bombarding ions [108,109]. The identiﬁcation and characterization of such hillocks requires AFM
methods, and the use of very low irradiation ﬂuences (<1010 cm 2) to assure that the tracks are well
isolated. Fig. 10 shows AFM images of several hillocks of around 10 nm wide and 5 nm high for LiNbO3
irradiated with Cu at 50 MeV. At moderate or high ﬂuences, an overall swelling of the irradiated
surface is observed. We will come back to the question of hillocks and swelling when discussing
the stress–strain distribution around tracks.

3.3. Thresholding behavior

There is overwhelming evidence that the generation of tracks is not related to nuclear collision
processes and it is only possible for electronic stopping powers above a certain threshold value
(thresholding effect). The threshold depends on material, ion type and even on ion velocity (see later).

Fig. 11. Diagram showing the electronic stopping thresholds measured for a number of dielectric and semiconductor materials
adapted from [21]. The two columns for each material evidence the dispersion of data (including velocity effects).

The determination of the threshold is not an easy task since it depends on a careful extrapolation of
the track area (or diameter) as a function of the stopping power near the threshold itself, where the
damage behavior is less clear. Fig. 11 shows a graphical representation of the measured electronic
stopping thresholds for a number of dielectric and semiconductor materials taken from Ref. [21].
The data cover a large range from around 1 keV/nm to 50 keV/nm and present a high dispersion, very
likely depending on the quality of the material and irradiation conditions (e.g. ion velocity). Above

18

F. Agulló-López et al. / Progress in Materials Science 76 (2016) 1–58

threshold, the radius of the tracks increases monotonically with the incident stopping power
[110–112]. Experimental data for LiNbO3 [110], illustrating the dependence of track radii on electronic
stopping power and the effect of ion velocity, are shown in Fig. 12. They compare irradiations at ener-
gies of 0.1 MeV/u and 10 MeV/u [104,110]. The data for low velocities using cluster molecular ions are
from [101]. They, both, include data corresponding to two different ion velocities. Even for amorphous
materials, like silica, heavily damaged tracks are induced by ion bombardment and have, indeed, been
observed. They are associated to deﬁnite structural changes (such as compaction in silica) that induce
a change in density and allow for their observation. For a number of hard materials like alumina or
some semiconductors (Ge, Si) the generation of track is not possible or very hard with the ion energies
available with present accelerators. However, the use of cluster ions having a much higher electronic
stopping power has made this possible [113–115].

As already mentioned, the radius of the track and consequently the threshold for amorphization by
single ion impacts, not only depends on Se and the speciﬁc material, but, also, on the ion velocity. In
other words, the damage cross-section is larger for low velocity projectile ions even for the same
stopping power. This effect, called velocity effect, that appears clearly illustrated in Fig. 12, is quite
relevant when discussing mechanisms and models. The velocity effect has been observed in many
other materials [116–120] and appears to be, primarily, related to the velocity dependence for the
initial electronic energy distribution caused by the ion impact. As illustrated in Fig. 4, at a lower ion
velocity the primary distribution of delta electrons reaches a smaller radial distance from the
trajectory and this determines a smaller radius of the spike.

3.4. Ion track morphology: core and halo

A relevant topic, not yet fully clariﬁed, is the structure and morphology of the latent tracks gener-
ated by swift ions, particularly, near the stopping power threshold. Several reports indicate that, near
threshold, tracks may be discontinuous [121]. The response to the question may provide some clues
on the mechanisms responsible for defects and track formation and provide support for the models
and views discussed in this review. Above threshold, there are some evidences that the morphology
and structure of tracks is complex and shows a central core region and a surrounding halo constituted
by point defects, clusters and extended defects (possibly dislocations) [25,122,123]. However, it was,
usually, believed that the occurrence of point defects in the track halo is only signiﬁcant for materials
sensitive to radiolysis, such as alkali halide and organics [25,122,123]. In fact, the generation of defects
by purely electronic excitation (ionizing radiation) is, indeed, well-documented for such class of
materials. This evidence was not available for most insulators, particularly oxides and semiconductors.

showing the velocity effect by comparing irradiations at energies of 0.1 MeV/u and 10 MeV/u [104,110]. The data for low
velocities using cluster molecular ions are from [101].

19

However, in recent years, new data suggest that defects in excess of those predicted by nuclear
collisions can be, indeed, formed under swift ion-beam irradiation. Some examples, using different
techniques, on a number of materials can be offered, such as on zircon, by using high-resolution
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) [127], LiNbO3, through refractive index measurements [84,128],
SiO2 (silica) through optical absorption [129] and Cu3N by elastic recoil detection (ERDA) [130]. It is
expected that those point defects would be primarily generated at the track halos.

The direct experimental evidence for the existence, structure and composition of the halo is scarce
due to the difﬁculty for adequate observation and characterization of this region around the core. In
fact, the available methods to track characterization, such as high resolution TEM, small angle X-ray
scattering (SAXS) and RBS/C, are based on the different physical properties (elastic, electrical, optical)
of the amorphous core in comparison to the matrix, and are essentially blind for point defects.
However, in relation to this problem one should note some more recent papers [124,125] using
HRTEM and MD simulations where the dual structure of the track showing core and halo is clearly
conﬁrmed. This behavior is very apparent by the HRTEM picture in Fig. 13 taken from Ref. [124]
corresponding to Gd2TiO5 irradiated with Au at 2.2 GeV. In this example the two regions present
different crystalline structures, orthorhombic at the core and hexagonal disordered at the halo.
Moreover, several interesting papers also show a peculiar morphology of tracks in mica [126], as well
as silica and quartz, using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) [99,100]. This technique is
non-destructive, not limited to the surface or near-surface regions and is sensitive to small density
changes at the nanometer scale. The data show a complex morphology, which suggest the existence
of a defective halo, and is not fully consistent with the standard thermal spike model that predicts
a sharp track boundary.

Finally, although the direct experimental support for the existence of the defective halo is not very
abundant, it is clearly suggested by measurements of the amorphization kinetics that can be reliably
ascertained by RBS/C techniques. In other words, this kinetics, associated to track overlapping, that
will be described in the next section, provides a convenient method to assess the morphology of
the tracks. In fact, it appears very relevant, for future work on the mechanisms of SHI damage, to
understand the connection between the structure and morphology of tracks and the distribution of
the generated point defects around the ion trajectories. Another important question related to the
existence of the halo, is to elucidate whether point defects can be generated below the stopping power

different structures [124]. Note that the halo (region 2) shows a different crystalline structure in comparison to that of the
pristine material (region 1).

threshold for track formation, in non-radiolytic materials such as oxides. As we will see below, the
amorphization kinetics supports this later statement for a number of oxides.

Aside from the existence of a halo constituted by point defects, one should consider the formation
of a surrounding elastically strained region (elastic halo) around the track core. The core induces sig-
niﬁcant stresses and strains in the material because the different elastic parameters of the amorphous
phase and that of the un-irradiated material. The stress distribution has been obtained by treating the
track core as an elastic inclusion [131,132]. Direct experimental evidence of the stresses has been
obtained from HRTEM [25,133,134]. In fact, the hillocks or protrusions appearing around the emer-
gence point of the tracks at the surface are, just, a direct consequence of the strain distributions.
The problem of these protrusions in a semi-inﬁnite continuum medium has been dealt with by Colin
et al. [135] using a Green’s method approach in an isotropic approximation. Useful analytical formulae
for the normal displacements at the surface as a function of the radius and elastic parameters of the
track core were obtained. The effects of crystal anisotropy on the stress–strain distributions have also
been recently described for LiNbO3, having trigonal symmetry [136]. These distributions are expected
to play a critical role on formation and propagation of fracture cracks and so, on the ‘‘surface cracking”
morphology under irradiation [137], as well as on the structure of etching patterns [103]. In the ﬁrst
example, the irradiation experiments on silica using Cl at 35 MeV and F at 19 MeV show that the crack
density increases with ﬂuence up to a certain maximum. At higher ﬂuences, once the the track distri-
bution becomes more uniform, the density declines.

3.5. Cumulative character of damage: track overlapping and amorphization

So far, we have been, mostly, concerned with the damage caused by single ion impacts. It is
expected that the overlapping of successive impacts would give rise to the ﬁnal damage morphology
observed after a given ﬂuence. This morphology will depend on the microscopic processes of track
overlapping i.e. on whether the single impact effects are, or not, fully or partially, additive. For
stopping powers above the threshold value, the random density of the generated tracks (one per
impact) increases with ﬂuence until they are expected to overlap and coalesce into a macroscopically
homogeneous defective (amorphous) layer, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 14. Due to the need to
overcome a threshold electronic stopping power, Sth, to generate tracks and initiate the damage, one
may form the layer either at the surface or buried into the material depending on the shape of the
stopping power curve. The two situations have been obtained in experiments performed on LiNbO3
[128,138–140] but also on other oxides such as KGd(WO4)2 [141], TiO2 [142] and SiO2 (quartz)
[143]. As a general rule, amorphization should start at those regions of the sample where Se reaches
a maximum value if
it lies above the threshold. For input energies below the Bragg peak
amorphization should start at the sample surface. As an example, a relatively uniform amorphous

green (preamorphous) regions correspond to stopping powers below threshold whereas the red color stands for fully
amorphized regions (above threshold). On increasing the irradiation ﬂuence the amorphous layer becomes thicker through
conversion of preamorphous (green) to amorphous (red) regions.

layer has been measured for ﬂuences above 1012 cm 2 at the surface [128,138,139] of LiNbO3, if the
stopping power at the input face of the sample is Se(0) > Sth  5 keV/nm (see Fig. 15a). The critical ﬂu-
ence correlates with the density of ion impacts needed to start overlapping. The amorphous layer has
been shown to be optically isotropic with a refractive index na = 2.10, that lies below the values for the
ordinary n0 and extraordinary ne indices of the crystal. This value, as well as the thickness of the layer,
have been obtained through the dark-propagation modes technique, by identifying the resonant
modes propagating along the amorphous–crystalline multilayer structure [139]. In fact, extrapolation
of that thickness as a function of electronic stopping power allows for an independent optical deter-
mination of the threshold for track formation. The data, corresponding to a velocity of 0.1–0.2 MeV/
amu (Si at 5–7.5 MeV) yield around 5 keV/nm which is within the range of values derived from
RBS/C techniques.

When the Bragg peak corresponding to the Se(z) curve lies inside the crystal, a buried amorphous
layer, starting from the depth corresponding to the position of the Bragg peak develops for LiNbO3 and
KGd(WO4)2 [140,141], as illustrated in Fig. 15b for LiNbO3 [140]. The two limiting faces of the layer
correspond to the depths z at which the stopping power is equal to the threshold value. This buried
low index amorphous layer offers a new route for applications in photonics and it allows for the fab-
rication of step-like optical waveguides [29] having a superior index jump (>0.1) and a sharp refractive
index proﬁle, which allow for light conﬁnement of, both, TE and TM modes and very promising appli-
cations in photonics (see Section 7).

Although the detailed structure of the amorphous layer is not known in most cases, the decrease of
refractive index caused by amorphization of SHI irradiated LiNbO3 has been interpreted as due to
breaking of the crystalline structure and the reorientation of microscopic regions of the sample during
the irradiation [128]. A related effect is the reduction of the measured spontaneous polarization at the
amorphized surface of the sample. On the other hand, Raman spectra taken under normal illumination
show that the surface layer produced by 5 MeV F ions has become amorphous (or near), as revealed by
the strong decrease in the height of the ﬁrst-order peaks [139]. The case of buried layers is, even, more
illustrative. The multilayer structure in Fig. 15, produced by irradiation with F at 22 MeV, was cleanly
characterized by micro-Raman spectroscopy in edge-conﬁguration [140] as illustrated in the two-
dimensional diagrams of Fig. 16. One clearly observes the much attenuated ﬁrst-order Raman peaks
at thicknesses correlated with the location of the amorphous layers in comparison with the sharper
spectra measured in the crystalline zones. The graphs also show how the width of the amorphous
region increases with the irradiation ﬂuence and extends toward the surface and into the inside of

stopping power curves are shown on the top of the photos for comparison. In the case (a) a dark amorphous layer is generated at
the surface, whereas in (b) the amorphous layer is buried into the sample. In the two cases that thick layer corresponds to
electronic damage and it is clearly separated from a faint thin layer corresponding to the nuclear damage at the end of the range
[84].

of around 8 lm (projected range) and corresponding to the region of nuclear (collision) damage.
Similar results, using refractive index and Raman-spectroscopy measurements, have been also found
for SHI irradiated KGW samples [141].

3.6. Kinetics of amorphization

The kinetics for the formation of amorphous layers in a variety of dielectrics has been monitored by
RBS/C [82,83,139,140,142] as well as by optical techniques, like Raman spectroscopy [139–141],
ellipsometry [143], dark mode propagation, [84,144–146], electrical conductivity methods [147] and
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on Pb2P2O7 [148]. In particular, the technique of
Rutherford Backscattering RBS in channeling conﬁguration (RBS/C) is a universal and very sensitive
technique to investigate lattice disorder in crystalline materials [149,150], regardless of their structure
and bonding type. The basic idea is to compare the RBS spectra of the irradiated sample, obtained under
random incidence, with that obtained by using a well collimated light ion beam oriented along a low
index crystallographic channel [139]. One sees that the channeled spectrum shows a very low yield
in comparison to the random one, due to the decrease in the effective cross-section of Rutherford
collisions caused by the steered ion propagation along the crystal channel. Then, one uses a simple
formula to calculate the damaged or disordered fraction S at a given depth, as a function of ﬂuence

S ¼ vi;ch   vch
vR   vch

ð11Þ

vR and vch, being the RBS yields obtained under random and channeled conditions, respectively, and
the subindex i standing for the irradiated sample.

Experiments in different materials have clearly shown that the amorphization kinetics associated

to the electronic damage obeys an Avrami-type law [149–151], i.e.

ð

Þng

Sð/Þ ¼ 1   expf  /=/0

ð12Þ
where S is the normalized amorphous area, at either the surface or a certain depth, after a ﬂuence /.
The exponent n that determines the abruptness of the kinetic proﬁle is dependent on stopping power
Se. For Se sufﬁciently above the threshold stopping power, expression (12) reduces to a Poisson law
(n = 1)

Sð/Þ ¼ 1   expð r/Þ

ð13Þ
where r = 1//0 represents the damage cross-section i.e. the damaged area (track) caused by a single
ion impact. Any of the two parameters, either r or /0, determines the ﬂuence needed to produce a cer-
tain amorphized area. In fact, usual methods to obtain the threshold stopping values use the extrap-
olation of the experimental dependence of the amorphization rate, (dS/d/)0 = r, vs Se, down to S = 0,
implicitly assuming that the statistics of tracks overlapping remains Poisson-like. Experimental curves
[151] for the amorphization of a-quartz irradiated with Br ions at different energies are displayed in
Fig. 17, together with a ﬁt to the Avrami expression. For stopping powers around or below threshold
the exponent n grows inversely with Se, suggesting the occurrence of an incubation region of ﬂuence
with a low damage efﬁciency. In this region, linear extrapolation of S to 0, is inadequate. The existence
of this incubation region conﬁrms the formation of defects in the sub-threshold regime and plays a
relevant role in the understanding of the amorphization kinetics [151].

Several theoretical approaches to deal with the problem of track overlapping have been discussed
in the literature, such as that by Gibbons [152], mostly in connection with the nuclear collision
damage. A recent approach [153] to describe the kinetic behavior of the disorder induced by SHI
irradiation resembles that by Gibbons and relies on the particular track morphology constituted by
a homogeneous amorphous disk (core) of area r and a homogeneous annular defective halo of area
h. In fact, the ﬁt of the model, which is independent of any particular damage mechanism, to the
measured kinetics provides a very convenient way to investigate the morphology of the tracks near
the threshold stopping. Moreover, it is assumed that the overlapping of a ﬁxed number N of halos
is required to amorphize the common area. Simple rate equations having a closed analytical solution
can be formulated to describe the increase in the total amorphized area S as a function of ﬂuence
(impact density) /. For the case N = 2, expression is very much simpliﬁed and writes:

Sð/Þ ¼ 1   expf r/g þ f1   expð h/Þð1 þ h/Þg expð r/Þ

that, for h = 0 (absence of halo), reduces to the Poisson kinetics, S = 1   exp ( r/). The analysis of the
amorphization kinetics with Eq. (14) is exempliﬁed in Fig. 17 for quartz and compared with Avrami’s
law. The predictions very well ﬁt the experimental data and account for the observed Avrami behavior
using different values for the parameters h and r. For energies above 25 MeV, the contribution h of the
halo is negligible. However, it has been clearly ascertained that a defective halo around the central
core is, indeed, necessary for a good ﬁt to the whole set of experimental data.

3.7. Threshold dependence on prior SHI damage

A novel feature that has not been, so far, considered by most workers, is the dependence of the
threshold stopping value on prior irradiation damage. It has been shown that the threshold stopping
power Sth for LiNbO3 crystals that have been pre-irradiated is reduced in comparison to that of the
pristine material, emphasizing the cumulative character of the SHI damage [139]. This fact suggests
that the previous damage (defects) adds to that created by the new irradiation, lowering the stopping
power requirements. This relevant effect has been inferred from experiments on the ﬂuence depen-
dence of the thickness of the amorphous layer generated by SHI irradiation. It has been observed that
such thickness increases when further increasing the ﬂuence. The effect (layer thickening) can be
alternatively described by the irradiation-induced propagation of the crystalline–amorphous bound-
ary. Detailed data have been obtained for LiNbO3 using Si at 7.5 MeV and 5.0 MeV, whose stopping
powers at the surface are clearly above (7.5 MeV) or close to (5.0 MeV) the threshold value. Fig. 18a
shows the layer thickness as a function of ﬂuence. One observes a large increase in layer thickness
from 0.8 lm at 1013 cm 2 to 2.5 lm at 1015 cm 2 for irradiation at 7.5 MeV. On the other hand, the
to 1.6 lm at
thickness grows from zero at
5  1014 cm 2 for the irradiation at 5 MeV. It has been proposed that this boundary propagation
toward the inside of the crystal [139], occurs because deeper regions of the crystal, initially below
threshold, are progressively reaching it as more defects are induced by irradiation. In other words,
the deeper regions of the ion trajectory that, initially, have a stopping power below the threshold, need
a certain prior incubation ﬂuence to induce damage and facilitate amorphization. From those data an
effective threshold was determined as a function of ﬂuence. It is, just, the stopping power at the posi-
tion of the boundary at such a ﬂuence, obtained from the SRIM simulations Se(z). The true material
threshold would be that corresponding to zero ﬂuence (pristine material). Results for the ﬂuence-
dependent threshold are displayed in Fig. 18b. Note that for high ﬂuences the threshold stopping
decreases from around 5.0 keV/nm (threshold for the pristine material) to less than 2 keV/nm, for a
ﬂuence of 1015 cm 2. Similar results showing the propagation of the amorphous–crystalline boundary
under SHI irradiation have been obtained for TiO2 [142].

3.8. Comparison between fs-pulse laser and ion-beam irradiation features

We have already commented in the Introduction about the similarities between SHI

ion
bombardment and femtosecond-pulse laser irradiations. The structural effects of fs-laser irradiation
on dielectric materials constitute a scientiﬁc ﬁeld in itself [33,34,154,155], with very interesting
technological application [156]. Indeed, the use of femtosecond laser pulses to record micro-scale sur-
face patterns in a variety of dielectric and semiconductor materials is well documented [157–162].
Those references illustrate the processing capabilities of such pulses in the ﬁelds of micro- and
nano-technology for optical, electronic and biological applications. Also these irradiation effects are
critical for the design of future fusion reactors using the inertial technology [163].

For the two irradiation cases, SHI and fs-laser pulses, the primary process is the massive electronic
excitation of the material in a time scale of femtoseconds (even less for ions). The responsible
mechanisms are, indeed, quite different. For laser irradiation the main mechanism is the linear and/
or nonlinear absorption of the optical wave energy, the relative importance of these two channels
depending on the laser wavelength and pulse power. For SHI-beams the excitation mechanism is
the Coulomb interaction between the projectile ion and the electrons of the material. Once the
material is electronically excited, the relaxation processes converting electronic excitation into heat
or atomic restructuring should be, in principle, quite similar.

The expected similarities between the relaxation of the electronic excitations induced by laser- and
SHI-beam irradiations, suggest that the discussion of the effects of SHI bombardment should beneﬁt
from the results and theoretical concepts developed to describe laser damage, and vice versa. In the
two cases the main objective is to understand the structure and morphology of the induced structural
damage and the nature of the responsible relaxation processes. A main feature of the fs-laser damage
is the formation of craters at the irradiated surface, schematically illustrated in Fig. 19a. Indeed,
some similarities and clear differences between the nanometric ion tracks and the micrometric surface
craters generated by irradiation with femtosecond laser pulses should be noted. Craters created by

laser ablation have a micrometer diameter in accordance with the spot size of the focused laser beam
that is limited by diffraction. An example is shown in the AFM microphotograph in Fig. 19b, for the
speciﬁc case of LiNbO3 [162] irradiated with a single laser pulse of 130 fs at 800 nm wavelength.
Ion tracks, that essentially involve a change in the structure of the material around the ion trajectory,
have a nanometer radial size related to the range of excited ballistic electrons. On the other direction,
the depth of the tracks is of the order of the ion projected range (micrometers), whereas that of laser
craters is typically of hundred nanometers in accordance with the range of the linear and nonlinear
interactions of laser photons in the material. The topic can be consulted in suitable references [164]
and some detailed comparative experiments with the case of ion beams (O, F, Si and Cl) have been
reported on LiNbO3 [165]. In this later work a number of phenomenological similarities have been
revealed. There is, ﬁrst, a well-deﬁned threshold of deposited energy density for the formation of both
tracks (amorphization) and craters (ablation). From the measured stopping power threshold for amor-
phization (Sth  5–6 keV/nm) by ion beams and for ablation (Jth  2 J/cm2) by laser pulses, one obtains
quite comparable deposited energy thresholds per unit volume of, Uth  7  104 J/cm3 [165]. More-
over, in both cases the extension of the damage, measured by the radius of the corresponding feature
(crater or track) increases with the total energy deposited at the impact site i.e. the number of laser
pulses or the ion stopping power. The evolution is, in the two cases, quite comparable as illustrated
in Fig. 20 for Si ions (a) and fs-laser pulses (b). The continuous and dashed lines in Fig. 20(a) corre-
spond to model ﬁts assuming threshold values Sth = 3 keV/nm and 7 keV/nm, respectively. In Fig. 20
(b) the continuous line corresponds to a theoretical ﬁt assuming a three-photon absorption process,
whereas the dashed line is intended as an aid for the eye [165].

As to the physical mechanisms that have been invoked to account for the electronic relaxation and
defect formation, during and after laser excitation, the situation is still far from clear. Although a dis-
cussion of this topic is out of the scope of our review, one should note that several models similar to
those describing track formation by SHI have been often discussed (e.g. non-radiative exciton relax-
ation, Coulomb explosion, etc.) [158,159,164]. Therefore, the parallel analysis of the laser and ion irra-
diation processes should be beneﬁcial for the two ﬁelds. Curiously, one early proposal to account for
those laser-induced effects is the bond-weakening mechanism discussed in Ref. [166]: a high level of
electronic excitation severely weakens the interatomic bonds so that lattice disordering can take place
even at relatively low temperatures [166–169]. Although this model has not been often considered for
ion beams, it may provide an interesting route to incorporate electronic effects when using MD strate-
gies to describe SHI damage. In summary, it is reasonable to think that the electronic relaxation pro-
cesses in the two cases (ions and laser pulses) have many aspects in common. Moreover, one may
suggest that the synergy between both irradiation techniques should be carefully examined in future
work, due to their complementary capabilities.

3.9. Radiation-induced electronic sputtering

Ion-beam irradiations in the nuclear collision regime cause atom ejection from the material, which
is a relatively well understood process. In the electronic stopping regime the structural damage leads

to largely enhanced [70,170–172] sputtering rates for some dielectric and semiconductor crystals, that
may reach a factor around 100 or more, in comparison to the nuclear case (typically smaller than 1 per
incident ion). The analysis of sputtering data in the electronic regime has revealed that it is intimately
connected with the production of latent tracks and lattice damage to the material. The phenomenon
offers an interesting test bench to check theoretical model for the electronic excitation damage. As a
meaningful example, the detailed data for SiO2 (quartz and silica) show a threshold stopping power for
the sputtering yield, which appears comparable (although apparently larger) to that measured for
track formation, as illustrated in Fig. 21 for quartz irradiated with Si [70]. Note the high sputtering
rates. Some prominent characteristics of electronic sputtering are: (a) the yield depends on the charge

28

state of the projectile ion, (b) total yields are orders of magnitude larger for insulating than for metallic
targets, (c) ionic crystals exhibit the highest sputtering rates, (d) as for nuclear collisions, the yield
increases with increasing incident angle hin of the projectile ion, according to a law that can be
approximately written as ðhinÞ ¼ Yð0Þcosh x
in , with x  1.7. Of special relevance for discussing physical
mechanism is the dependence of the total yield on the deposited energy (stopping power Se). It shows
a strong superlinear dependence

with n > 1 (between 1.5 and 4). This strong nonlinearity is at the origin of the threshold concept. On
the other hand, the angular distribution for the yield of the sputtered atoms Y(hsp) is nearly isotropic
for several oxides, i.e. Y(hsp) / cos hsp. However, for ionic crystals such as alkali halides (LiF), the angu-
lar distribution presents an additional, very signiﬁcant, jet-like component centered on hsp = 0 [173]. In
fact, purely ionizing radiation has been shown to induce sputtering of alkali and halogen ions from
alkali halides [174–176]. Alkali atoms are sputtered according to a Lambertian distribution which is
characteristic of a thermal evaporation process. In contrast, halogen atoms are emitted along some
preferential directions, h110i and h211i, with energies in excess of those for thermal evaporation. This
was considered as a proof of the formation of replacement collision sequences as a consequence of
non-radiative exciton decay [175]. In relation to the SHI-induced sputtering additional experiments
should be performed to determine the role of incident ion charge, as well as the charge distribution
of the sputtered atoms. Moreover, data on their energy distribution and clustering state would be very
valuable.

4. Mechanisms and models

4.1. General introduction

Basically, four types of models have been proposed and explored at different levels of depth to

understand the ion-beam damage in the electronic stopping regime. They are:

 Thermal spike models.
 Coulomb explosion models.
 Thermally-assisted atomic displacements (bond breaking) models.
 Non-radiative exciton recombination models.

The Coulomb explosion was the ﬁrst model, suggested by Fleischer [74], to account for track
generation in minerals. The physics behind it has been brieﬂy commented in Section 2.5. The
connection between the Coulomb explosion model and thermal spike models has been analyzed by
Bringa and Johnson using MD simulations [76]. The very short charge neutralization time required
to re-establish charge neutrality poses some caution on the real validity of the model as discussed
in [64,79]. Related to the Coulomb explosion model are the bond-weakening effects [177] operating
under dense electronic excitation, and associated to the strong interrelation between crystallographic
and electronic structures. They have been mostly used to understand lattice instabilities under short-
pulse laser excitations [166,167]. Anyhow, treatments of the Coulomb explosion model have not been
much elaborated and so we will delete them from a more detailed analysis.

The thermal spike model represents the most investigated and applied approach to describe track
formation in materials. Much of those developments using the 2T approach can be ascribed to the
work of Toulemonde and coworkers (e.g. see [20]), which will be summarily discussed in Section 4.2.
Some alternative formulation of the thermal spike model such as the Szenes analytical approximation
and the MD simulations are also discussed in Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2. Since very detailed treatments
are available we will encourage the reader to consult them.

In this review we will mostly focus on other alternative models that may be also quite relevant for
a complete understanding of the electronic damage, such as the thermally-assisted atomic displace-
ment (Section 4.3) and exciton models (Sections 5 and 6). The thermally-assisted atomic displacement

F. Agulló-López et al. / Progress in Materials Science 76 (2016) 1–58

29

model is an extension of the thermal spike that introduces point defect generation in the scheme and
so it completes its phenomenology. The incorporation of point defects to the model leads to
cumulative approaches for the electronic damage and alternative explanations for track formation.
Finally, exciton models are the only ones fully relying on the capability of electron–hole pairs, by
themselves, to modify the atomic network and generate point defects during their relaxation.
They are also cumulative approaches and constitute a key topic of the review to be discussed in
Sections 5 and 6.

As a general rule, all those models are not completely independent and they may present

overlapping contributions to the full damage process.

4.2. Thermal spike models for track formation

The concept of thermal spike discussed in Section 2.4 has been quite useful to understand a number
of features of track formation by electronic excitation [20–22,178–180] and provides the basis of the
thermal spike model. The primary process is the energy transfer from the excited electron system to
the ionic lattice as described by the two coupled equations (8). They determine the spatial and time
temperature proﬁles as a function of radial distance r from the ion trajectory. The high temperature
reached in the hot region may lead to local melting of
the material and cause partial
re-crystallization or amorphization during the subsequent fast cooling. The critical stopping power
Sth required to initiate melting, is deﬁned as the threshold stopping power. For stopping powers above
such threshold a cylindrical region of radius R overcomes the melting point and an amorphous or
partially crystalline track is generated on cooling. The two coupled equations formalism can predict,
through numerical integration, how the track radius increases with increasing stopping power. In fact,
the numerical simulations performed for a variety of materials (including dielectrics, semiconductors
and even metals) show a reasonable quantitative agreement with the experimentally observed trend.
As an example, the good ﬁts obtained for LiNbO3, using different ions and energies, including molec-
ular clusters, are illustrated in Fig. 12. Moreover, one sees from the two sets of data points and ﬁtting
curves in the ﬁgure that the velocity effect on the damage cross-section is, also, well reproduced. The
key point to understand this effect lies in the width of the initial energy distribution of the ballistic
electrons characterized by the Waligorski radius RW, deﬁned in Section 2.3. For lower velocities this
radius is smaller, so that the density of deposited energy and, consequently, the temperature rise, is
higher, leading to a lower stopping power threshold.

In some cases amorphization is not induced and the differences found in the behavior of various
materials have suggested their classiﬁcation in amorphizable and non-amorphizable, depending on
their possibility for amorphization [70]. Examples of non-amorphizable materials are ionic com-
pounds, like alkali halides or CaF2. For these materials a better criterion for track formation may be
when the deposited energy overcomes the cohesive energy of the material. Moreover, other phase
transformation possibilities are also open as a consequence of the local heating and subsequent fast
quenching. Superheating and supercooling are ignored as well as the limited velocity of the melt–solid
interface [179]. If the maximum temperature reached within the spike is below the melting point, the
material remains crystalline and a track will be not, in principle, generated.

In principle, the thermal spike model predicts Poisson-like kinetics for the dependence of the
degree of amorphization with irradiation ﬂuence. This allows to extrapolate the initial amorphization
rates plotted as a function of stopping power to derive the value of the threshold Sth [20]. However,
this is not always the case, particularly for stopping powers not far from threshold that constitute a
key region for the extrapolation. This has to do with the morphology of the tracks that should take into
account the possible existence of a surrounding defective halo.

In summary, the thermal spike model assumes that the track formation is an abrupt phenomenon,
in principle, different from the
as corresponds to a phase transformation (melting), and is,
amorphization processes operating during collision damage. On the other hand, one should recall
that the dynamics of the e–h recombination and its role on the electron–phonon energy exchange,
has not been considered in Eq. (8). Anyhow, the concept of thermal spike is, indeed, an essential
ingredient for any alternative theoretical approach to describe the electronic damage, as for the
excitonic model.

4.2.1. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the spike

With the availability of high-speed computers, MD simulations have provided a very efﬁcient tool
to monitor the processes triggered by a fast heavy ion in materials. In other words, they appear quite
appropriate to describe in a realistic way the atomic processes occurring during the thermal spike
associated to a swift heavy ion impact [22,180–182]. In fact, one main interest of MD simulations is
to test the validity of empirical and phenomenological models, such as the thermal spike [183,184],
the Coulomb explosion [77] or shock-wave models [185], to describe the formation and morphology
of the tracks. However, the extension of these simulation methods from the nuclear to the electronic
stopping regime, where a very high density of excited electronic carriers is produced, is not trivial. In
fact, the method faces formidable problems due to the difﬁculty in handling the electronic part of the
processes that, in principle, would require a quantum-mechanical approach. Anyhow, MD methods
are expected to give additional insights into the atomistic behavior under the severe thermal and pres-
sure conditions achieved during the SHI impacts. However, even for describing the atomic dynamics,
one needs appropriate interatomic potentials under the massive electronic excitations reached during
irradiation. Various semi-empirical potentials with different degrees of reliability have been used for
simple materials as silica and silicon [186–189]. The detailed expression for the potentials can be
derived from a ﬁt of the experimental parameters of the material to the MD predictions. However,
one should also consider the role of the high level of ionization caused by SHI irradiation on the inter-
atomic forces [177], which may lead to unrealistic conclusions. In summary, a number of MD studies
have been carried out that shed some light on the validity and limits of the thermal spike models used
for irradiation damage and sputtering [99,184,190].

Recently, there have been several attempts to include the electronic contribution into the MD
formalism of SHI damage in metals through the so-called 2T-MD models. The high initial electronic
temperature is calculated by assuming that the energy lost by the ion per unit distance (electronic
stopping power) is transferred to the electrons. Energy is, then, exchanged between the lattice and
the electron system at each MD time step by means of a Langevin thermostat at the electronic tem-
perature and a source/sink term in the heat diffusion equation. The electronic energy is transported
through the diffusion equation using the same parameters i.e. electronic speciﬁc heat, electronic ther-
mal conductivity and electron–phonon coupling strength as in the thermal spike model. So far these
methods have been mostly applied to evaluate the sensitivity of metals to electronic stopping effects
[191], to determine the extent of core melting and residual defect conﬁgurations [41] and for
sputtering simulations [192].

4.2.2. The analytical Szenes approximation to the thermal spike

Szenes [117,193] has developed a useful analytical approximation to the above thermal spike
model that often simpliﬁes the analysis and offers simple predictions. Moreover, it results convenient
when discussing later alternative models for electronic damage and, therefore, it will be summarily
described here. The analysis ignores the details of the electron–electron and electron–phonon interac-
tion processes until a thermal equilibrium has been reached at a time taken as t = 0, with a maximum
temperature value at r = 0. In fact, the Szenes approximation is exclusively concerned with the cooling
stage of the atomic spike. It is reasonably assumed that during that overall cooling process, the proﬁle
for the increase in temperature DT = T   TS, over the background substrate temperature TS of the
un-irradiated material, keeps Gaussian,

DTðr; 0; SeÞ ¼

ð16Þ

where a(t) is a time-dependent proﬁle half-width, starting with a0 at t = 0, q the material density and C
the speciﬁc heat capacity of the complete system (excited electrons plus atoms). The time dependence
a(t) can be derived by applying the thermal transport equations, assuming that the total deposited
energy, is preserved, i.e. ignoring radiation or other (shock-wave) losses. In addition to a0, the other
key parameter of the model, g, stands for the fraction of the total deposited energy by the ion impact
that has been stored as heat. Values are, essentially, chosen ad-hoc, in order to ﬁt the experimental
data, and lie in the 0.3–0.7 range for many dielectric materials. One possible reason for such a factor

F. Agulló-López et al. / Progress in Materials Science 76 (2016) 1–58

31

is related to the balance between the kinetic (energy) stored as heat and the potential energy
associated to the e–h coupling in the electronic system (Section 2.4).

The maximum temperatures reached for any t > 0 at a given distance r from the track axis is

The threshold value Sth stands for the critical electronic stopping at which DT(0, 0, Sth) = 0 and
starts to be above zero for Se > Sth. In other words, the melting point is only reached at r = 0 (or
RC = 0). The calculated values of the track radii show the correct trend as a function of stopping power
and are in reasonably good agreement with those derived from the coupled-equations approach for
suitable values for the parameters g and a0. In fact, the selected value a0  4 nm, for the initial half-
width of the temperature proﬁle is closely related to the electron–phonon mean free path k in the
two-temperatures model. In a later work, Szenes has proposed a universal relationship between track
radii and melting point that seems to be obeyed for a large number of materials [194,195]. In principle,
the above analytical approximation may also predict the velocity effect by considering velocity depen-
dence parameters a0 and g. For YIG, the model analysis [117] indicates that g plays a major role (it goes
from 0.35 for low velocity to 0.19 for high velocity), although the inﬂuence of a0 cannot be ruled out.
More detailed analyses are needed for a full clariﬁcation.

4.3. An extended thermal spike model: thermally-activated atomic displacements (bond-breaking)

The thermal spike constitutes an on–off model that may account for track formation, the existence
of a threshold stopping power and the evolution of the track radius with Se. However, it appears, in
principle, unable to explain a number of features of swift-ion damage that have been experimentally
revealed. For example, it cannot explain neither the lattice damage caused below the threshold stop-
ping power (sub-threshold damage), nor the morphology of a single track consisting of core and halo,
particularly in the energy region close to the threshold. It cannot either account for the kinetics of
amorphization under multiple-impact irradiation, i.e. the Avrami-law dependences for the amor-
phized area as a function of ﬂuence. One interesting consequence of such non-Poisson kinetics is
the existence of an incubation ﬂuence that is required for track formation below the threshold Sth. This
effect is, also, well known for experiments on fs laser pulses where the threshold value has been found
to depend on the successive application of identical pulses.

Therefore, one is inclined to modify the classical viewpoint and focus on models that are essentially
concerned with the generation of point defects by the irradiation. In fact, this is a complementary
approach to that of the thermal spike models. Following this idea, an analytical phenomenological
model based on the thermal spike concept to understand point defect production was developed at
CMAM [196,197]. It was applied to LiNbO3 and compared to experiments. It constitutes a ﬁrst attempt
to account for track formation as a ﬁnal stage of point defect generation by SHI irradiation. Unfortu-
nately, no information on the speciﬁc nature of the radiation-induced defects and their formation
energies is, so far, available, for most materials. The model uses the analytical approach by Szenes
to describe the local temperature rise around the ion trajectory (Gaussian distribution). In accordance
with such a model an initial Gaussian temperature proﬁle (Eq. (17)) is assumed for the temperature

32

rise at t = 0, Then, authors propose that the irradiation-induced relative atomic defect concentration c
(T,r, z), which, which is locally attained, depends on the temperature T through an Arrhenius law [53],
ð19Þ
where T = TS + DT. A is a factor depending on the atomic density and some effective vibrational
frequency, and e stands for a bond-breaking or formation energy for the generated defect. Expression
(19) requires that thermal equilibrium has been locally attained (as in the thermal spike model).
However, this assumption might be avoided and substituted by a rate equation for defect formation
that would introduce some additional complexity in the model.

Then, an integration is performed over the radial r and depth z coordinates in terms of the

temperature proﬁle T(r, z) caused by the bombarding ion having stopping power Se

to obtain the total number n of defects generated by a single ion impact along the projected range Rp.
The parameters of the model are those for the thermal spike (a0 and g), together with the formation
energy e and the pre-exponential factor A in (Eq. (19)), that should be known or be considered as a free
parameter to ﬁt the experiments. Since Sth is determined by the thermal spike parameters, q, C, a0 and
g (see below), it is preferable to use Sth instead of g as a model parameter, as long as the threshold can
be directly derived from experiment.

The ﬁnal equation (20) yields the total concentration of defects produced per impact that is a
superlinear function of stopping power through the Arrhenius factor. This explains, at least at a qual-
itative level, that SHI irradiation introduces defects whatever the stopping power is, even below the
threshold value. In fact, the model is just a defect generation model that allows to compute the defect
concentration generated under a given ﬂuence /. In order to account for lattice amorphization and
track formation, the model has to go a step forward and propose that amorphization results from
the accumulation of point defects in the spike until a certain critical defect concentration cth is reached
and the lattice collapses. This occurs, just, at the threshold stopping power Sth. Note that the Arrhenius
law (Eq. (19)) accounts for a superlinear dependence of the defect generation rate on electronic stop-
ping power up to the concentration reaches that critical value cth. Then, it is proposed that the lattice
undergoes a defect-assisted phase-transition [198] to an amorphous state but not an ordinary thermo-
dynamical phase change of the pristine material. In other words, the model introduces a physical
mechanism different from ordinary melting to describe amorphization. The differences between the
two types of amorphization are rather subtle and might be useful to understand the difference
between amorphizable and non-amorphizable materials [20,70]. In fact, that difference is expected
to depend on material structure and type of bonding. This point would deserve particular attention
in future work.

The above formalism was applied to describe the experimental data obtained on LiNbO3 [196]. The
evolution of the track core radius with stopping power is essentially determined by the temperature
proﬁle in the thermal spike and so it leads to a similar dependence to that derived from the thermal
spike model. Even more important, it can account for the dependence of the thickness of the surface
amorphous layer on irradiation ﬂuence (thickening of the amorphous layer). This is a novel relevant
result that cannot be explained within the standard thermal spike model. The data simulations for
the depth of the inside boundary of the amorphous layer under irradiations with Si at 5 MeV and
7.5 MeV are comparatively displayed [196] in Fig. 22. The model is able to ﬁt the two irradiation cases
when using e around 0.7 eV and Sth = 5.2 keV/nm as model parameters. In other words, the thermally-
assisted atomic displacement model reproduces well the single track data explained by the thermal
spike model but are, also, able to account for the cumulative behavior under increasing irradiation
ﬂuences. Some systematic discrepancies are observed for high ﬂuences, suggesting changes in the
model parameters during irradiation or indicating some shortcomings of the model.

From the optimized value of the energy barrier e, a critical atomic defect concentration
c = cth  10 3 for Se = Sth was derived using Eq. (19). This threshold concentration would cause the
collapse of the lattice in the region close to the trajectory and generate the track. One cannot check

amorphous layer under irradiation of a LiNbO3 sample with Si at 7.5 MeV (a) and Si at 5 MeV (b). Note the linear ﬂuence scale.
The model parameters are Sth = 5.2 keV/nm, a0 = 5.5 nm and e = 0.6 eV. Experimental points are represented by full symbols for
irradiation with Si at 7.5 MeV and open symbols for irradiations at 5 MeV. The dashed lined includes a velocity correction to the
model curves [196].

the reliability of this estimate for cth, since the phase diagram for LiNbO3, including point defect con-
centration as one of the coordinates, is not known [198].

One main advantage of the thermally-assisted defect creation model is that it involves point
defects as the primary effect of irradiation. Then, it readily allows to interpret the morphology of
the tracks consisting of a central core plus a surrounding defective halo. This is illustrated in
Fig. 23, schematically showing the defect concentration proﬁle c(r), having a roughly Gaussian shape.
For Se > Sth the central part of the concentration proﬁle (r < RC) is above the critical concentration for
collapse [198] and corresponds to the amorphous core. For longer radial distances the generated
defect concentrations are lower than such critical value and correspond to the halo. This theoretical
scheme could be extended to describe more complex situations such as that depicted in Fig. 13.
Depending on the proﬁles of defect concentration and temperature around the track axis one may
understand the formation of different phases with different stoichiometry that would be determined

formation, that yields the defect concentration proﬁles for a given electronic stopping power Se. For Se > Sth, there is a central
region (core) where the concentration c surpasses the critical concentration cth for collapse [208]. For Se < Sth, a defective halo
appears.

34

by the extended phase diagram including defect concentration as additional thermodynamical
variable [198].

The morphology of the tracks including core and halo, allows for describing the Avrami kinetics for
amorphization using the type of models for track accumulation considered in Section 3.6. Finally, an
important feature of the model described in this section is that it accounts for both point defects and
tracks in a uniﬁed way. Moreover, an additional potential is that it may be readily translated into MD
simulation codes.

4.4. Modeling for sputtering emission

It is expected that the models proposed to account for the structural modiﬁcations in the material
(damage) would be, also, able to account for sputtering data. It has been, often, accepted that the atom
sputtering caused by swift ion impact has to do with the creation of melted and/or vaporized regions
leading to thermal ejection of atoms from the surface of the material. Therefore, it is expected that
thermal spike models could readily account for the thresholding behavior of sputtering in a similar
way to track formation. The detailed experiments performed on SiO2 and other materials appear to
support this view [70]. Other theoretical models for electronic sputtering have also been occasionally
used [199]. Anyhow, in order to describe quantitatively the rate of atom sputtering, the thermal spike
model has to be extended to take into account atomic displacements (point defect formation) and the
migration and escape of the displaced atoms out of the material. In other words, a defect-creation
model similar to that described in Section 5.3, is, additionally, required. This type of bond-breaking
model was proposed and discussed by Sigmund and co-workers [200–202] and also used in more
recent work [70,99,203]. The local sputtering yield Y(r, t) is written as

Yðr; tÞ ¼ N

exp U=EAðr; tÞg

ð21Þ

where N is the atomic density, M the molecular mass and U the binding energy at the surface. EA = kBTA
(TA atom temperature) is the local energy of the atoms whose dependence on radial distance and time
can be readily obtained from the two-temperatures formalism through Eq. (8). In order to apply such a
model one should take into account that the relevant region for sputtering is the few nanometers layer
close to the surface. This stands out the relevance of the charge of the input ion on arriving to the
surface before reaching the stationary value inside the material. The ﬁnal expression for the total
sputtering output results from the integration of (21) with regard to space and time

Although alternative analyses have been also developed [63,199], the most signiﬁcant effort has
been devoted to exploit the thermal spike and Sigmund models, leading to expressions (21) and
(22). A representative example is the analysis of experimental data on crystalline (quartz) SiO2, as a
representative dielectric material, plotted in Fig. 21. The track and sputtering data show a reasonable
agreement between theory (thermal spike together with Sigmund models) and experiment. The solid
lines, corresponding to the theoretical simulations, use the same electron mean free paths, k = 3.8 nm
to describe either sputtering yields (evaporation) or track radii (melting) [70]. One notes that the cor-
responding threshold for sputtering is apparently higher than that for track formation [70], although
the determination of the sputtering thresholds is not trivial. The highly superlinear sputtering rates
observed in Fig. 21, as a function of electronic stopping power, are a manifestation of the energy bar-
rier in the Arrhenius law describing atomic displacement and/or sublimation. The Sigmund model has
been also applied to describe sputtering yields in SHI irradiated LiF [70,173]. The accordance between
experiments and theory is, again, reasonable using a rather standard value for the thermal spike
parameter, k = 3.8 nm, and a sublimation energy of U = 1.3 eV. In summary, thermal spike models
can readily account for the thresholding behavior in sputtering, if they are complemented with
thermally-assisted defect production models. The other experimental features of the sputtering
phenomena such as angular distributions and dependences on stopping power have been less

F. Agulló-López et al. / Progress in Materials Science 76 (2016) 1–58

35

investigated. Moreover, some speciﬁc problems such as the jet-like distribution of sputtered atoms
observed for LiF are still unsolved, as mentioned in Section 3.9. This phenomenon is not consistent
with a thermal spike approach and other possible mechanisms, such as exciton models, should be
explored [174–176].

Recently, molecular dynamics simulations have been applied to analyze the sputtering processes
[183]. Some differential features with regard to the commonly used thermal spike models, such as
the dependence on stopping power Se, have been pointed out.

5. Non-radiative exciton recombination models

5.1. Introduction

A main shortcoming of thermal spike approaches is that they neglect the ﬁnal fate of the electronic
carrier pairs generated during the ion–material interaction, i.e. e–h recombination is not considered.
We, here, recall, that a large fraction of the energy deposited by the ion (as much as 30–50%) goes into
electronic excitation that stored as potential energy by the coupled electron–hole pairs (excitons).

Within the framework of defect generation models, one may ask whether the generated electron–
hole pairs are capable, by themselves, to cause lattice damage in a way similar to that developed pre-
viously for explaining ionizing damage to alkali halides [23,24,53], which are the model systems for all
developments in the ﬁeld. In principle, the energy stored in an exciton is comparable, and often higher,
than that required to break a bond and produce lattice damage. Just as an example, for LiF the bond
energy (or better the cohesive energy per unit molecule) is 5.99 eV whereas the gap energy is
13.7 eV. Similarly, the bond energy for quartz is around 4.5 eV and the gap is around 8 eV. As for alkali
halides and other radiolytic materials, the ﬁrst step for an exciton model should be to localize the
energy of the exciton at a certain lattice site, forming a self-trapped exciton (STE), which would facil-
itate energy transfer to the lattice. Self-trapping has been deﬁnitely ascertained in condensed rare
gases, organic molecular crystals, alkali halides, alkaline earth ﬂuorides, silicon dioxide, silicates and
some other insulating materials (both crystalline and amorphous) [23,24]. To offer reliable rules to
decide in which materials excitons can or cannot is an unsettled problem due to the diversity of
electronic structures, bonding types, material stoichiometries, etc. In fact, for moderate or large-gap
insulators self-trapping is considered more normal than exceptional [204].

The physical basis for the excitonic approach have been extensively investigated by many workers
and is summarized in some classical books [23,24]. The idea originates from the extensive information
available on bond breaking and dissociation for the excited states of molecules. Due to the very
different masses of electrons and nuclei
it is possible to make a dramatic simpliﬁcation the
Born–Oppenheimer or adiabatic approximation, in which the electronic and ionic motions are
uncoupled. Within this approximation, the total energy of the different molecular levels depends on
the atomic conﬁgurational coordinates (adiabatic energy surfaces), as simply illustrated in Fig. 24,
considering one single coordinate Q. For certain molecules the curve for the excited state shows stable

Fig. 24. Schematic conﬁgurational coordinate (Q) diagram illustrating the dissociation of a molecule or molecular cluster after
excitation into an excited state presenting two regions (A and B) in its adiabatic potential separated by an energy barrier e.

36

(A) and dissociative (B) regions. At region A, around the equilibrium coordinate (Q0 = 0 in the plot),
photon emission (radiative de-excitation) is mainly produced together with phonon creation (heat).
The transition from A to B, through a certain energy barrier, leads to separate the two atoms of the
bond (Q) and causes molecular dissociation (bond breaking). For a crystalline solid, its translational
symmetry poses some special problems but molecular models are still very useful since
self-trapped excitons are strongly localized in the lattice and can be considered as a molecular cluster.
Fig. 24 is also quite useful to understand the interplay between light emission and defect creation
during irradiation.

A pioneer qualitative excitonic analysis to understand ion-beam damage on a variety of dielectrics,
including oxides, was put forward by Itoh et al. [169,205,206]. Following this path, researchers have
recently proposed that excitonic models may be responsible for track formation in materials where
the threshold stopping power is lower than 10 keV/nm. Anyhow, a relevant problem to discuss exciton
effects is the need for an appropriate knowledge about the properties of the electronic carriers
produced by excitation, their interactions with the lattice and the possibilities of self-trapping. This
would require a large amount of transport and spectroscopic data that are not available in many cases.
At this stage it is adequate to recall that exciton models are not directly concerned with track
formation and they exclusively refer to the conversion of electron–hole pairs into point defects. The
problem of lattice amorphization and track formation requires an additional step to understand the
coalescence of the generated defects, as already pointed out in connection with the thermally-
induced bond-breaking model (Section 4.3). In principle, this step may be similar for all radiation-
induced defect generation models and, as assumed in [196,197] may rely on a phase-transition model
that is driven by the cumulative incorporation of frozen-in defects in the lattice [198].

5.2. General criteria for the applicability of exciton models

From the information gathered for alkali halides one can now formulate some general rules to
discuss exciton models in a wider context. For excitonic models the point defects are generated from
the energy transferred from a single exciton (or maybe a cluster of close excitons) to the ionic lattice.
In order to assure an efﬁcient defect generation process from the non-radiative decay of the excitation
energy a few general criteria can be proposed [24,207]:

 The excitation energy has to be well localized in a given lattice site e.g. by forming a self-trapped
exciton (STE). One should remark that carrier (either e or h) localization, is, often, a previous step
for STE formation. Anyhow, the occurrence of carrier as well as exciton self-trapping is a common
feature in many dielectric (strongly polarizable) crystals, including alkali halides, alkaline-earth
halides, ﬂuoride perovskites, chain and layered chalcogenides (As2S3, As2Se3), and transition metal
oxides (MnO, NiO, . . .). In many other cases the existence of STEs is controversial (MgO, TiO2, Al2O3,
LiNbO3, ZnO, . . .) but cannot be ruled out. In fact, the usual way to ascertain the occurrence of STEs
is through a broad luminescence band with a large Stokes shift, and an excitation spectrum
coinciding with excitonic features in the absorption spectrum or presenting a cut-off at the band
edge. One of the experimental difﬁculties is that lifetimes are, generally, short in comparison to free
excitons. Also, for many open-shell oxides CoO, NiO, where excitons may be expected, the lack of
stoichiometry and the large amount of compensating defects makes identiﬁcation rather difﬁcult.
Finally, one may also consider the possibility of exciton localization by forming bound exciton-
impurity pairs as in ZnO and many semiconductors.

 One of the non-radiative de-excitation channels of the STE should lead to lattice reorganization i.e.
bond breaking or point defect formation. This condition demands that the exciton energy is high
enough to cause the disorder. This defect-creation channel may be thermally activated and require
the overcoming of a certain energy barrier.

 The lifetime of the bond-breaking channel has to be short enough in comparison with that of
competing relaxation channels to assure the generation of point defects. This requires that the
thermal energy barrier separating the bound and dissociative regions in the excited adiabatic curve
is sufﬁciently low.

F. Agulló-López et al. / Progress in Materials Science 76 (2016) 1–58

37

 The non-radiative de-excitation channel should represent a signiﬁcant fraction of the total decay

rate.

 The defect partners generated by the STE recombination have to be separated far enough to avoid

rapid recombination and assure their survival.

Since the applicability of exciton models and their detailed formulation are strongly dependent on
the particular material, we postpone a deeper analysis to the discussion of the selected materials
where evidence is available, such as, in NaCl, LiNbO3 and SiO2.

5.3. A quantitative phenomenological exciton model

NSTEðr; zÞ ¼ g SeðzÞ

The particular model to be described here [208,209] to account for SHI damage has been initially
developed for LiNbO3, although it is expected to be of more general application. In particular, it has
also been applied to alkali halides (Section 5.5). It uses a similar analytical formalism to that described
for the bond-breaking model and relies on the synergy between the thermal spike and the excitonic
recombination processes. A thermal spike approach is ﬁrst assumed to describe the heating of the
material around the ion trajectory, with a temperature proﬁle given by the corresponding Szenes
expressions (17). The core region remains at a high temperature for a certain time, 10 13 s, allowing
for electron thermalization. During subsequent cooling, and through electron–phonon and e–h
coupling, STEs may have been formed and stabilized. The total number of STEs formed at any segment
of the track (depth z) is written as, Se(z)/I, I being an effective ionization energy (Section 2.5). It is, also,
assumed that the initial local concentration of NSTE at a radial distance r and t = 0, follows the same
proﬁle as that for the temperature, i.e.
expf r2=a2
0g

ð23Þ
where I  2.5EG [80,81]. This is a reasonable assumption that greatly simpliﬁes the mathematical
analysis. g is a certain efﬁciency factor for the formation of NSTE, that would be taken, g = 1, for
simplicity. The radial proﬁle Nex(r, z) of the exciton concentration constitutes a mirror spike to that
for the temperature (thermal spike) and it is designated as exciton spike. The temperature spike
evolves as described by the Szenes model, whereas excitons, for simplicity, are assumed to have a
frozen distribution given by Eq. (23), ignoring possible STE migration. This simpliﬁcation is not
expected to alter, substantially, the physics of the process, although a more detailed analysis should
be necessary. In order to follow the fate of the excitons, one takes into account the two possible decay
channels for the STEs, radiative and non-radiative, assuming that it behaves as a molecular cluster and
the adiabatic energy level diagram is similar to that schematically depicted in Fig. 24 for a molecule.
The excited STE level leads to atomic displacements and defect (Frenkel pair) formation if the excited
electron overcomes a certain energy barrier e in the adiabatic energy curve for the excited state. If the
barrier is sufﬁciently low excitons can easily overcome the barrier into the dissociation region and
cause, mostly, defect formation. If the barrier is very high, the STE decay proceeds predominantly
by photon emission. In the more general case, the exciton decay rate is

m0 being an effective frequency factor, and sR the radiative lifetime of the exciton level. The ﬁrst term
stands for the rate of STEs overcoming the barrier per unit time and forming defects, according to an
Arrhenius law for the process. The second term represents the radiative emission rate. At the high
temperatures existing at the core in the initial stage of the spike, the non-radiative channel is
dominant and Frenkel pairs are formed. Once the spike cools down, that efﬁciency rapidly decreases
and the radiative channel predominates, the total lifetimes being much longer (Pns). In practice, the
exciton lifetime can be assumed to be inﬁnite when calculating the amount of defects generated by
the ion impact. The Arrhenius term in expression (24) is the appropriate source term for defect
formation and provides the strong nonlinear dependence of the defect production rate on Se, which
is in the basis for the thresholding phenomenon. The radiative channel in (24) for the light emission

during irradiation constitutes the objective of ionoluminescence experiments that would be a very
relevant complement to the studies of damage.

The decay kinetics for the STE concentration, NSTE(t), can be obtained by solving Eq. (24) with the

initial Gaussian proﬁle (23) and the normalization condition,

Now, numerical integration of this equation is required after a suitable choice of the model
parameters: m0, Sth, I, a0, and e. I and m0 have commonly accepted values and other parameters (a0
and Sth) may be estimated from independent experiments on track formation and morphology using
the thermal spike approach. Therefore, the energy barrier e remains as the only free (adjustable)
parameter for the exciton model.

The amorphization threshold is directly related to the critical concentration of defects cth which

causes a lattice collapse through Eq. (26). Consequently, it can be derived from Sth.

5.4. Application to SHI damage to LiNbO3

LiNbO3 is a ferroelectric crystal at RT with band-gap of 3.8 eV and constitutes a reference electro-
optic material and a key material for integrated optics and for nonlinear and photorefractive optics
[210,211]. In principle, this material does not appear to be the best option for the application of an
exciton model, since the occurrence of STEs is not, yet deﬁnitely, ascertained. However, it is well
established that electrons are self-trapped at regular Nb5+ sites (small polarons) in LiNbO3 by thermo-
chemical methods [212–214], as well as by irradiation with pulsed laser, electrons and X-rays
[215,216]. They present energy levels in the gap, due to the strong lattice relaxation, migrate through
the lattice by hopping motion and may become ﬁnally trapped at certain impurities or defects
[217,218]. On the other hand, there is some evidence for the self-trapping of holes and formation of
O  hole polarons [219]. The existence of electron and hole polarons (self-trapped carriers) suggest that
the occurrence of STEs may be a realistic possibility. In fact, X ray-induced luminescence experiments
report the emission of a well-deﬁned emission band at k  425 nm presenting a large Stokes shift
whose peak position and yield is independent of crystal purity and radiation-induced damage
[220,221] and may correspond to STE transitions, as proposed by several workers. Moreover, evidence
for bound (trapped) exciton states has been obtained in Pr3+-doped LiNbO3 [222].

The phenomenological exciton model discussed above [208,209] has been applied to quantitatively
explain data on LiNbO3 irradiated with silicon ions at several energies. First, the dependences of the
track core radius on stopping power have been calculated for two values of the stopping threshold
(Sth = 3 keV/nm and Sth = 8 keV/nm) and are plotted in Fig. 25 together with the experimental data
[208]. The other model parameters are a0 = 4.5 nm, I = 10 eV, m0 = 1012 s 1, that are consistent with
the Szenes’s analysis for the thermal spike. The ﬁt values for the free parameter e are in the range from
0.3 to 0.5 eV, which is not unreasonable and accounts also for other experimental features (see below).
The overall experimental trend is well reproduced within the two threshold limits and the quantita-
tive data are best ﬁtted for Sth = 8 keV/nm.

A more signiﬁcant achievement of the exciton model in relation to the thermal spike approach is
that it satisfactorily accounts for the experimental data on the displacement of the amorphous–
crystalline boundary (or thickness of the surface amorphous layer) with irradiation ﬂuence. The
simulations, using the following model parameters (e = 0.34 eV, a0 = 4.5 nm, m0 = 1012 s 1 and
Sth = 5 keV/nm) have been compared in Fig. 26 to experimental results for two energies of the
bombarding silicon ions (5 MeV and 7.5 MeV) [209]. The role of exciton lifetime has also been
explored as illustrated in the ﬁgure. A good agreement, between theory and experiment has been
found with the above ﬁtting parameters, regardless of the exciton lifetime within the reasonable range

Fig. 25. Theoretical ﬁts to the experimental data in LiNbO3 on the dependence of the radius of the amorphous track on
electronic stopping power with the exciton model. The curves correspond to two different threshold stopping power,
Sth = 3 keV/nm (continuous line) and Sth = 8 keV/nm (dashed line) and a ﬁxed energy barrier e = 0.34 eV [208].

irradiating with Si at 7.5 MeV (solid squares) and Si at 5 MeV (open circles). The role of several values for the exciton lifetime s
and energy barrier e have been explored [209].

10–1000 ns, i.e. much longer than the duration of the thermal spike. Note that the barrier energy
(e = 0.30–0.50 eV) is lower than that derived from the thermally-assisted bond-breaking model
(Section 4.3). This points out to the role of excitonic processes to enhance irradiation-induced damage
in comparison with thermally –assisted processes.

Finally, the critical defect concentration cth needed for amorphization, namely, to reach the thresh-
old stopping value Sth was calculated. Although the value should be taken with caution, the absolute
atomic concentration comes out around 1.5 nm 3 which corresponds to a relative atomic concentra-
tion of cth = 7.5  10 2, i.e. 7.5% of the niobium concentration in the crystal. The model also gives the
radial distribution of the generated defect concentration and allows for a quantitative prediction for
the sizes of the track core and halo. With this information the kinetics of amorphization was theoret-
ically simulated by using a Monte Carlo approach that assumes full additivity of the radiation-induced

40

defect concentrations [145]. The results of such simulations provide a detailed account for the evolu-
tion of damage morphology and offer a good accordance with the Avrami kinetics experimentally
measured.

5.5. The exciton model for purely ionizing damage to alkali halides (NaCl)

Alkali halides (AX, A being the alkali and X the halogen) are strongly ionic compounds having, in
most cases, a cubic (f.c.c.) structure and a wide transparency range. For NaCl the gap energy is EG
around 10 eV. Due to their strong ionic character these crystals are generally considered as non-
amorphizable for the application of thermal spike models. One advantage of alkali halides when dis-
cussing the exciton model for defect formation under SHI irradiation is that the model is, already, well
established to understand defect production under purely ionizing irradiation [23,24,53]. For this type
of irradiation, F centers consisting of neutral halogen-vacancy centers with a trapped electron or F cen-
ter, are the simplest type of defect. At high temperatures (around or above RT) aggregates of F centers,
containing two (M = F2), three (R = F3) or more F centers can be readily formed. As a ﬁnal stage of this
aggregation process alkali metal colloids may appear. Moreover, one ﬁnds hole centers, such as the Vk
center and the interstitial halogen centers (H and I centers). The Vk center is constituted by a hole self-
trapped at a halogen site shared by two adjacent X  ions, that relaxes into a X2  molecular ion ori-
ented along the h110i crystallographic direction. The H and I centers, respectively, correspond to an
interstitial halogen atom X0 and halogen ion X . With regard to excitons, it is well-established
[23,24,53] that they self-trap in the lattice as a Vk center bound to an orbiting electron (STE). The
scheme of electronic levels is quite complicated. For NaCl the intrinsic luminescence due to the radia-
tive decay of the STE consists of two bands, one r-polarized (parallel to the STE axis) and the other
showing perpendicular polarization (p-polarized). They, respectively, correspond to transitions from
singlet and triplet exciton states with energies, 3.4 eV (p) and 5.5 eV (r) and lifetimes of
3.1  10 4 s (p) and 2.8  10 9 s (r) at LHeT, presenting a strong energy relaxation in comparison
to the band-gap energy (around 10 eV).

Aside from some early models [223], the production mechanism by purely ionizing irradiation (UV
light, X-rays and gamma rays) is now reasonably well understood, i.e. the non-radiative recombina-
tion from some STE states creates a halogen Frenkel pair (F + H), and competes with the radiative
(luminescence) emission, as discussed in suitable references [23,24,53]. Fig. 27 shows a rough sketch
of STE levels in NaCl to understand the competing recombination channels, either radiative or non-
radiative, this later one leading to formation of Frenkel pairs (F + H). The two alternative channels,
p-light emission and defect formation, are separated by a certain energy barrier as such considered
in the discussion of molecular dissociation, Fig. 24. At high enough temperature, the excited electron

41

crosses the barrier into the dissociation region and the F and H center partners of the Frenkel pair are
created. Within this scheme the primary efﬁciency for Frenkel pair formation is an increasing function
of irradiation temperature whereas the p luminescence yield is an anticorrelated decreasing function.
In principle, it is expected that the same type of excitonic model applies when dealing with SHI
irradiation.

5.5.1. Exciton-model simulation of the SHI irradiation experiments

Detailed ion irradiation experiments on several alkali halides have been performed at GANIL and
GSI on NaCl, KCl and LiF using several ions (Au, Pb, Bi, Zn, Xe and U) and high energies in the GeV range
[224–228]. The results, particularly on LiF [228] indicate the formation of tracks as well as color
centers. Chemical etching and small-angle X-ray scattering were used to identify the tracks, whereas
the formation of color centers was monitored by optical absorption. One peculiar feature of tracks
formed in alkali halides is the occurrence of an extended halo (tens of nanometers) having a high
concentration of color centers and a core region 2–4 nm diameter that appears to be responsible of
chemical etching above a critical electronic stopping power. This core region accumulates aggregated
centers as an alternative to amorphization.

The GANIL group determined the growth kinetics of the color centers (F and others), together with
that for the r and p ionoluminescence emissions from STEs in the irradiation temperature range from
15 to 100 K. The intensities of the two emission bands show similar trends with temperature to those
observed under purely ionizing irradiation. The French group was able to account for the evolution of
the luminescence yields with temperature by using the thermal spike model [224–226]. Since such
model is blind to point defect formation, no simulation of color center growth was performed. The
theoretical simulations provided, ﬁrst, an estimate of the temperature proﬁle inside the thermal spike.
Then, using the known lifetimes for the r and p emissions as a function of temperature, they were
able to predict the evolution with temperature of the luminescence yields. The results are very
sensitive to the assumed radial extension of the spike, making the agreement between theory and
experiment essentially qualitative. More recently, the exciton model, as developed for LiNbO3, has
been applied to account for the reported GANIL data on NaCl, as a representative alkali halide crystal
[229]. The objective was to describe jointly the F center kinetics and the evolution of the luminescence
yields. The analysis considers a thermal spike, DT(r, z, t), as simulated with Eq. (17) of the Szenes
model, together with an excitation spike consisting of the same radial proﬁle for the STE
concentration, NSTE(r, z, t), given by Eq. (23). The two competing processes for exciton decay, including
light emission and defect (F + H) formation are expressed by Eq. (24). The calculation of the emission
yield requires integration of the local yield

Yðr; z; tÞ ¼ NSTEðr; z; tÞ=s

ð27Þ

over time t and the radial r and depth z coordinates, s being the STE lifetime. The local production rate
of F centers involves the alternative non-radiative channel,

dNFðr; z; tÞ=dt ¼ NSTEm0 expf e=kTðr; z  tÞg

ð28Þ

e being the energy barrier for the non-radiative channel. This expression only accounts for the initial
rate of F-center production before aggregation processes enter into play. The comparison to
experiment requires integration of (28) over the whole range of the ion trajectory that was
numerically performed.

The simulations [229] using the above formalism yield a reasonable agreement, see Fig. 28, for the
p-light emission yield (a) and for the initial F center production rate (b), within the investigated
temperature range (up to 80 K). The same spike parameters were used to describe the evolution of
luminescence emission and the F center production rates. In particular, the chosen value for the
spike width a0 = 12 nm is within the range used by the GANIL group to describe the evolution of
the luminescence yield with irradiation temperature. The good agreement supports the view that
the excitonic model, successfully used to describe ionization damage, can be applied to describe the
effects of SHI irradiation if one considers the coupling between the thermal and excitation spikes.

6. SHI damage to SiO2 materials (quartz and silica): role of excitonic models

SiO2, either crystalline or amorphous, is an abundant and thoroughly investigated material with
numerous technological applications to microelectronics and photonics, as well as to diagnosis in
industrial and nuclear facilities. On the other hand, an extensive search has been carried out since
many years on the electronic and optical properties of SiO2 as well as on the defects and structural
modiﬁcations induced by a diversity of physical treatments including irradiation [230,231]. Therefore,
it appears as a very convenient material to discuss the effects of the electronic excitation during SHI
beam irradiation. On one side, in relation to the discussion of excitonic models, a main advantage of
these materials is that exciton self-trapping has been deﬁnitely ascertained. Moreover, like for alkali
halides, it has been shown that non-radiative decay of STEs generates point defects (microscopic
damage) under light and electron irradiation. It is, therefore, expected that excitonic models could,
at least, partially, describe the microscopic damage caused by electronic processes during SHI
irradiation. On the other hand, SHI irradiation also induces track formation as a damage at a
macroscopic scale (macroscopic damage).

6.1. Structural considerations: STEs and color centers

The basic structural unit is the rigid SiO4 tetrahedra, typical of sp3 hybridization, with Si at the cen-
ter and an oxygen atom at each of the four corners [232]. It may exist in several crystalline structures,
the alpha-quartz being the stable structure at RT and normal pressure and is the one considered in
most studies such as the present review. The amorphous phase, silica, consists of a random network
of the SiO4 tetrahedra. A convenient way to describe the structure in SiO2 is through the size distribu-
tion of the closed rings found when tracking the path of successive SiAOASi bonds. For quartz, only
rings consisting of 6 and 8 members exist, whereas, the ring distribution is broader for silica and
includes 3- and 4-members rings. The distribution is altered by thermal treatments causing structural
changes that lead to network reordering and compaction. One advantage of the distribution of ring
sizes is that some of them present clear peaks in the Raman spectra that serve for identiﬁcation e.g.
D1 peak at 495 cm for 3-members rings and D2 at 606 cm for 4-members rings [233,234]. Moreover,
they cause a signiﬁcant shift in the frequency of the ﬁrst-order features in the vibrational IR spectra,
that appear at 1078 cm 1 and 805 cm 1, respectively. The ring distribution plays a relevant role in the
optical properties (e.g. band edge location), refractive index and as trapping sites for excitons.

A variety of structural defects and color centers have been identiﬁed in SiO2, and their production
under different types of radiation sources has been thoroughly investigated [231–235]. Color centers
represent atomic size defects associated to a network site that are usually identiﬁed by their absorp-
tion bands. Some of them present, also, clear EPR signals that facilitate structural characterization. In
most cases they involve SiAO bond scission and stabilization at some structural point defect. For
example, the E0 center („Si) corresponds to an oxygen vacancy that has trapped a hole on one of
the two Si neighbors, leaving one single unpaired electron at the site of the bond (dangling bond rep-
resented by the dot on the silicon atom). The NBOH center corresponds to a non-bridging oxygen
bound to a single Si atom, and leaving a dangling p oxygen orbital (OASi„). Another relevant intrinsic
color center is the ODC corresponding to a SiASi bond after removal of the intermediate oxygen atom.
The existence of coupled e–h pairs (excitons) in silica and quartz has been inferred from the optical
spectra close to the band gap or within the band to band region. A variety of coupling and relaxation
possibilities exist for the free excitons, both in quartz and silica, which are analyzed in the review
papers by Trukhin [236,237]. In particular, the existence of self-trapped excitons (STEs) is well ascer-
tained [23,24,238], as well as their key role on the generation of point defects and color centers
[23,24,239] through non-radiative recombination. They show a broad luminescence (radiative) emis-
sion at around 2.6 eV, corresponding to a triplet–singlet optical transition of the STE center [238–243].
The structure of the STE in SiO2 is strongly conditioned by the covalent nature of the bonding and it is
closely related to a Frenkel-type defect [23,244,245]. Fig. 29a illustrates the maps for the e and h
concentrations at the STE site, and Fig. 29b shows the very large reduction in the excitation energy
induced by the relaxation (lengthening) of the SiAO bond [244]. One can see that the lattice relaxation
causes a decrease of around 6 eV in the optical transition of the STE.

The total lifetime of the triplet level of the STE obeys

44

i.e. the respective decay probabilities add to each other. The situation appears simpler for crystalline
quartz, where the lifetime keeps constant at s  1 ms up to about 150 K and then decreases with
increasing temperature in an approximate exponential way [23,246]. The low temperature value
corresponds to the radiative emission, whereas the non-radiative component dominates at high
temperature. The data for silica show a different behavior, and the temperature dependence above
100 K markedly deviates from a single exponential law. The differences found between quartz and
silica reveal the key role of the SiO4 network distortions on the STE lifetime. In pure samples, the
efﬁciency for formation of STEs from uncoupled e–h pairs has been shown to be close to 1 (>0.1),
so that exciton self-trapping represents a signiﬁcant channel for the electronic excitation [23].

6.2. Macroscopic effects on quartz (amorphization) and silica (compaction)

For quartz and amorphous silica, SHI irradiation induces two kinds of effects. On one side, point
defects and color centers (microscopic damage) are generated during irradiation. On the other hand,
macroscopic damage involving local modiﬁcations in the macroscopic properties of the material
(density, refractive index) is also produced and occurs at the single track level. These structural
changes are described as heavy lattice disordering and amorphization in the case of crystalline quartz.
For silica the main observable effect of SHI irradiation is an increase in density (compaction), possibly
due to restructuring of the ring network.

For amorphous SiO2 the data have been derived from AFM, TEM and SEM microscopy images, in
most cases after a chemical etching [107,247], or inferred from the radiation-induced changes in
the IR spectra [247–249], ellipsometry [143] and dark-mode analysis of light propagation [146]. From
all those studies a well-deﬁned electronic stopping power threshold of around 2 keV/nm has been
reported, although large differences are often observed, possibly depending on ion velocity and the
speciﬁc measurement technique.

For quartz, the studies have used TEM [87], RBS/C [94,147,250], dark mode techniques [144] and
even ionoluminescence [251]. The kinetic curves obtained from RBS/C have been interpreted in terms
of a cumulative track overlapping model assuming an amorphous core and a defective halo. The
corresponding threshold stopping power for quartz appears in a similar stopping range (2–4 keV/nm)
as that for silica but having a slightly higher value.

In principle, the existence of such threshold data for amorphization (quartz) and compaction
(silica) effects are clearly indicative of electronic excitation mechanisms (and not of collision
processes). Moreover, the evolution of the track radius with electronic stopping power and the
threshold values for the two phases are roughly consistent with the predictions of the thermal spike
model. However, there are several difﬁculties. On one side, the kinetic RBS/C data near the threshold
do not ﬁt into such thermal spike model. In fact, the situation may be more complex than expected in
accordance with recent SAXS experiments performed on silica [99], which suggest a complex radial
structure for the track consisting of a low density core and a higher density halo, as shown in

Fig. 30. MD simulations of the atomic density proﬁles at the tracks generated by a single ion impact in silica for different
incident stopping powers. The dashed line corresponds to the proﬁle derived from SAXS experiments. Note the existence of core
and halo regions [99].

Fig. 30. For quartz, the same type of experiments have indicated that the track structure is also com-
plex [100] and it may also include core and halo regions. These structures are reproduced by MD sim-
ulations [252] that should be, indeed, actively pursued for a better appraisal of the structure and
morphology of tracks. Recently SAXS experiments together with MD simulations have been used to
investigate the effect of moderate ﬂuences on the density patterns caused by irradiation with
185 MeV Au ions. It appears that a steady state of density ﬂuctuations is obtained in amorphous
SiO2 as a consequence of track overlapping [253]. Those new data appear more consistent with the
results obtained from cumulative models, based on point defect generation, than from purely thermal
spike approaches.

6.3. Microscopic structural effects: color center creation

Color center formation by swift ion-beam damage has been less investigated than that induced by
purely ionizing radiation sources or light ion irradiations [254–257]. They are expected to be quite rel-
evant to discuss on the damage mechanisms by ion beams. Main color centers correspond to dangling
bonds resulting from the breaking of the tetrahedral SiAO bonds of the structure. They include: (a)
non-bridging oxygen centers (NBOHC), represented in chemical notation as „SiAO, where the dot
used as superscript stands for a an unpaired electron (dangling bond), (b) E0 centers, „Si, that can
be considered a partner of the NBOHC after breaking of the bond and (c) oxygen deﬁcient centers
ODC, „SiASi„, that involves an oxygen vacancy leading to a new bond between close-by silicon
atoms. Color center growth curves under SHI irradiation in silica glass were obtained by Ma et al.
[258] using Fe and Xe ions with energies in the GeV range. The evolution for the total concentration
NC for NBOH, E0 and ODCII centers per unit area and the whole ion range, shows a Poisson-type
behavior, as a function of irradiation ﬂuence /

Nc ¼ Nsf1   expð r/Þg

ð30Þ
This kinetics is similar to that measured for ionizing radiation sources, r being an effective produc-
tion cross-section. At large enough ﬂuences, the growth curves reach a saturation volume concentra-
tion Ns, comparable for both NBOH and E0 centers. The question, still open, is to decide whether point
defect creation by SHI is due either to collision or electronic mechanisms. Recently, a systematic study
has also been performed on silica [129] by irradiating with Br ions having a wide range of MeV ener-
gies and electronic stopping powers (1–7 keV/nm), whereas the nuclear stopping power remains
essentially constant at a much lower value. The coloring kinetic data agree with those of [258], show-
ing a Poisson-type kinetics, as well as similar evolutions for the NBOH and E0 centers with ﬂuence. The
initial growth rate of those curves, j = (dNC/d/)/=0 = NSr, represents the number of defects generated
along the damage track per single ion impact, and it is a key parameter to ascertain the energetics of
color center formation. The data for j as a function of the electronic stopping power Se are displayed in
Fig. 31. They are very illustrative and reveal two clear regions. At low stopping powers, below around

Fig. 31. Initial rate of color center production by a single ion impact in silica as a function of electronic stopping power. Note the
different rates for collision mechanisms dominant at low stopping powers and electronic mechanisms operating at high
stopping powers [129].

2 keV/nm, the measured coloring efﬁciency (around 7500 eV/color center) is roughly constant and
independent of electronic stopping power. It was proposed that it is associated to atomic collision
mechanisms (nuclear stopping power). Above such threshold value, the rate is an increasing function
of electronic stopping power regardless of the nuclear stopping power, clearly demonstrating that an
electronic contribution for defect generation becomes, indeed, dominant over that due to the elastic
collision processes. The threshold found for the microscopic damage (around Se  2 keV/nm) is close
to that measured for the macroscopic (compaction) effects [146]. This appears to be the ﬁrst direct evi-
dence for the existence of a threshold for color center production by SHI, and a proof that electronic
effects may cause both microscopic and macroscopic damage. In principle, this correlation provides
support to cumulative models for track formation and damage.

A deeper analysis has still to be carried out to elucidate the nature of the electronic mechanism,
either thermally-induced bond-scission or non-radiative exciton (STE) recombination. If one uses
the approximate phenomenological expression [72,73], Ne–h  Se/2.5EG, for the density of electron–
hole pairs generated by irradiation, the estimated energetic cost per color center indicates an approx-
imate efﬁciency g  0.1–0.5% for the conversion of excited carrier pairs into color centers. This value is
not far from that found [224,225]] for ion-beam irradiation of alkali halides where the exciton model
appears well established. It is, indeed, well-established that the non-radiative exciton recombination
generates point defects by exciting SiO2 with ionizing radiation e.g. laser and synchrotron radiation
pulses [259–261]. In particular, some mechanisms have been proposed to account for color center
formation during STE relaxation from the irradiation with laser and synchrotron pulses, e.g.

In reaction (a) an ODCI center has been generated and an oxygen interstitial atom has escaped from its
bonding neighbors. In process (b) an E0 center and a complementary non-bridging oxygen (NBOH) cen-
ter have been produced. In fact, the data in [261] suggest that the two above reactions may be oper-
ative during SHI irradiation. Another interesting remark is that some published data indicate that
strained bonds, mostly corresponding to three- and four-members rings, are more efﬁcient for point
defect production as pointed out by Hosono et al. [262]. It should also be remarked that the lumines-
cent emission is also very sensitive to bond strain [251]. These phenomena point out to the key role of
bond straining on the two recombination channels for STE, either defect production or radiative emis-
sion and point out to a key role of excitonic processes. Anyhow, the role of excitonic processes on SHI
damage has to be, further, assessed and discussed in comparison to alternative thermal bond-scission
processes.

To that end, detailed experiments and MD simulations should be carried out to elucidate the

relative importance of thermal and excitonic processes.

7. Technological implications

The new features of the phenomena operating for electronic excitation during ion beam irradiation
offer a number of possibilities in a large variety of technologies, going from micro- and nano-
electronics and photonics, to space technologies, biomedicine and nuclear ﬁssion and fusion applica-
tions. In this review we can only offer some hints of those possibilities that help to appreciate the
enormous potential of the ﬁeld.

7.1. Nanotechnologies

Nanotechnology is a rapidly developing broad ﬁeld with a great potential for applications in many
areas, particularly electronics, photonics and information technology. On one side, the use of ion-
beams in the general ﬁeld of nano-structuring of materials has been often reviewed [26,28]. In fact,
ion tracks can be, indeed, used to build nanostructures having around 10 nm lateral dimensions
and up to micrometer lengths. These features and the straight trajectories of SHI offer interesting
perspectives in catalysis, nano-electronics and photonics. As an example, ion tracks in diamond-like

mask [263].

carbon (DLC) transform the initially insulating diamond-like (sp3) material into conducting graphite-
like (sp2) carbon. Based on this structural transformation, some nano-electronic devices have been
proposed, such as quantum dots and ﬁeld emission cathodes [27]. Another relevant application of
latent tracks is the fabrication of commercial ion track membranes using the nanopores achieved after
etching of the SHI irradiated material. They can be made on polymers, crystalline insulators and
glasses with calibrated pore diameters between 15 nm and several microns [19,26,263–265]. The
nanopores are fabricated by irradiation with low ﬂuences (106–108 cm 2) to avoid track overlapping.
Fig. 32a shows an AFM image of a hexagonal array of submicron pores on X-cut LiNbO3 irradiated with
5 MeV Si beam [102]. As an alternative example, Fig. 32b shows an AFM image of a rutile sample
irradiated with Br at 25 MeV and a ﬂuence of 8  1013 cm 2 through a alumina mask with pores of
70 nm diameter and 2 lm thickness [264]. Moreover, the pores can be ﬁlled up with certain metal
or semiconductors to fabricate micro or nanometer-diameter needles, wires or tubes and
consequently, ﬁeld emitters and other devices [26].

A well-documented way to produce nano-particles embedded in host matrices uses ion
implantation to induce clustering and precipitation of the implanted ions [11]. With this method,
nano-particles of different metals having controlled sizes can be produced by the implantation,
usually, followed by suitable thermal treatments. Swift ions, having larger projected ranges can be
used to place the particles deeper in the material. In principle, the procedure relies on the incorpora-
tion of the ions at the end of the range where nuclear collisions cause both implantation and damage.
On the other hand, the particular features of electronic damage processes by swift ions can be, also,
used to modify the shape of the nanoparticles through the ion hammering effect. One can go from
spherical to elongated aligned shapes having anisotropic electrical and optical properties, which can
give rise to their tailored plasmonic responses.

7.2. Photonics

For photonic component and devices some very appealing possibilities have been already
demonstrated using swift ions by irradiating LiNbO3 with F at 20 and 30 MeV and ﬂuences in the range
1012–1014 cm 2 [29]. This irradiation conﬁguration leaves a crystalline layer at the surface
(waveguiding region) separated from the bulk of the crystal by a thick amorphous low index layer
acting as an optical barrier. The scheme of an optical waveguide fabricated by such method together
with a photograph illustrating the propagation of a He–Ne laser light beam are shown in Fig. 33 [266].
The novel method has several main advantages over the standard ion implantation: (a) the ﬂuences
required are one or two orders of magnitude lower and (b) the waveguiding region is almost free of
the defects created by elastic collisions that concentrate at the end of the range. Moreover, the optical

Fig. 33. Propagation of a He–Ne laser beam through a planar high-conﬁnement step-like waveguide fabricated on LiNbO3 by
irradiating with F at 20 MeV, followed by thermal annealing [267].

the method described in the text.

waveguides fabricated in LiNbO3 [29] present sharp step-like proﬁles with a high index jump in the
two refractive indices (0.2 and 0.1 for the ordinary and extraordinary indices, respectively) causing
a strong mode conﬁnement. Those waveguides are also advantageous over other alternative
production methods such as metal doping, proton exchange and conventional light-ion implantation.
In particular, they present very low optical losses after suitable treatments. Values lower than
0.5 dB/cm have been achieved by irradiating with F at 20 and 30 MeV and [267], followed by annealing
treatments at 350–375 °C. This excellent performance is based on the large thickness of the amor-
phous barrier and the partial recrystallization effects caused by the thermal treatment. Waveguides
have also been fabricated by that procedure in other dielectric crystals such as KGW and quartz. Other
sophisticated optical circuits for use in nanophotonics have also been produced with the novel
method. As an example one may quote laser active planar waveguides on Nd-doped LiNbO3 [268]
and ring resonators, Fig. 34, with 80 lm radius acting as wavelength ﬁlters at the 1.5 lm telecom
wavelength [32]. The nonlinear optical performance of those waveguides in LiNbO3 is quite
satisfactory since the SHG response keeps at 60% of its value even after the irradiation ﬂuence needed
to produce optimum waveguiding. Moreover, the mode coupling is facilitated by the strong mode
conﬁnement associated to the high and sharp index jumps. Finally, the possibility to apply phase-
matching methods such as periodic poling of those waveguides to enhance the SHG response has been
successfully explored [269].

On the other hand, by using swift ions such as Kr and Xe in the GeV energy range (10 MeV/amu),
optical waveguides in the near and medium infrared for astrophysical applications, have been success-
fully fabricated on LiNbO3. Thicknesses of 40–50 lm have been attained, depending on ion energy and
ﬂuence, together with smooth proﬁles and refractive index jumps up to 0.04 (k = 633 nm). The contri-
bution of nuclear energy losses is very small and defects produced by elastic collision are not signif-
icant along most of the ion trajectory. Although LiNbO3 is not the most adequate material for

F. Agulló-López et al. / Progress in Materials Science 76 (2016) 1–58

49

applications beyond 4 lm wavelength, due to its high optical absorption, the experiments have
demonstrated the potential of the method [30].

Similar surface waveguides as those described for LiNbO3 have been fabricated on KGW and
characterized by dark-mode propagation and Raman spectroscopy [141]. Moreover, the index
enhancement (structural compaction) achieved at the surface of silica by irradiating with swift ions
has permitted to produce optical waveguides even with relatively low ﬂuences and stopping powers
[146]. Due to the natural abundance, low cost and numerous applications, this result may ﬁnd
interesting uses in future devices.

On the other hand, by combining the refractive index changes caused by SHI with the etching
behavior of the irradiated surfaces one may fabricate a variety of channeled and ridged waveguides
[31], and integrated optics devices at the microscopic scale that may be extended to the nanometric
scale [32]. One speciﬁc example is a Mach-Zehnder microinterferometer in LiNbO3 [13].

7.3. Nuclear power technologies

In the nuclear energy ﬁeld, electronic damage may be also very relevant in relation to nuclear
waste storage and management [16,270]. In fact, it is necessary to assess the long-term durability
of spent nuclear fuel that has been immobilized within mineral based ceramics. Actinide-containing
minerals, such as zircon (ZrSiO4) are considered to endure extreme geological events over geological
timescales. Therefore, they are useful candidates for nuclear waste storage. However, in the long term,
the alpha-decay taking place in those ceramics will severely disrupt their crystalline structure, favor-
ing the escape of the actinides and severely reducing the durability of the deposit. In this context, it is
important to make reliable predictions of the amount of damage and amorphization and assess the
possible contributing role of the electronic damage not generally considered in the analyses. Recently,
in Pu-containing zircon, a factor two damage enhancement, in comparison to the predictions derived
from elastic collisions, has been reported [127]. The emitted a particles by the actinide nuclei have
energies in the range 4.5–5.5 MeV and the recoil actinide atoms 70–100 keV. A reliable prediction
of the electronic damage cannot be made at this stage since the electronic processes operating in this
material are not yet known. The study reported in Nature uses high resolution NMR spectroscopy. The
29Si NMR spectrum of undamaged zircon exhibits a narrow line at 81.6 ppm consistent with silicon
bonded to four non-bridging oxygen atoms in the crystalline structure. After alpha-irradiation the
spectrum presents an additional broad resonance due to SiO4 tetrahedra in amorphized material.
On the basis of these measurements the initially crystalline structure of the zircon would be amor-
phous after only 1400 years in a geological repository (desired immobilization timescales are of the
order of 250.000 years). Assuming for the electronic-induced damage comparable values to those
for LiNbO3 one may predict 1200 point defects per alpha particle, that is similar to that of elastic col-
lision origin and so it comes out close to the reported damage enhancement (a factor 2–3).

For nuclear fusion applications the effects of the SHI irradiation are expected to be quite relevant
[271]. For fusion reactor installations using magnetic conﬁnement technologies, a strong research
effort has been already made to search for adequate materials. The theoretical analyses mostly use
nuclear collision models [17,272,273]. However, the giant enhancement caused by electronic
excitation from medium mass ions may cause additional severe degradation in reactor components
(windows, feedthroughs, . . .) [84]. The nuclear fusion reaction D + T = a + n produces neutrons with
energies of around 14 MeV that transfer signiﬁcant kinetic energy to light atoms like, C, O and even
Si, which are components of oxides and other useful insulating materials. As an example, the maxi-
mum energy received by O atoms from the fusion-reactor neutrons is 3.4 MeV, whereas the average
transferred energy is 1.7 MeV. The corresponding stopping powers (up to around 3 keV/nm) are in
the range where electronic stopping damage starts to be signiﬁcant and may cause severe long-
term deterioration of insulating components in a fusion reactor.

For future reactors using the inertial fusion approach, the effects of electronic excitations by ion
bombardment may be even more important [274]. A key issue is the survivability of the ﬁnal optics
necessary to couple the laser energy into the fusion target. The ﬁnal optics is subjected to a hostile
environment, including high energy neutrons and gamma rays and possibly very signiﬁcant ﬂuxes
of X rays and energetic ions. The results presented in this review paper suggest that electronic

50

F. Agulló-López et al. / Progress in Materials Science 76 (2016) 1–58

mechanisms of damage to optical components may be relevant and constitute a real source of com-
ponent degradation.

7.4. Other potential applications: space technology and biomedicine

These are ﬁelds where electronic damage processes might be also quite relevant. For space
technologies, depending on the type of mission, the space vehicle is subjected to a variety of energetic
particles including electrons, protons, heavy ions and neutrons [275]. The near-earth environment is
mainly constituted of particles trapped in the magnetosphere extending up to around 10 earth radii.
Here protons have up to 800 MeV and ﬂuxes that may reach 105 protons cm 2 s 1, whereas for heavy
ions the ﬂuxes are several orders of magnitude smaller. Cosmic radiation contain heavy ions with
energies up to TeV but very low ﬂuxes (1 cm 2 s 1). In principle, heavy ion ﬂuxes are small enough
so that the corresponding electronic damage could not represent a serious hazard. However, one
should take into account that latent tracks produced in single impact events represent a highly local-
ized damage region that may degrade electronic components and devices [10]. Finally, one should
mention that very energetic protons and alpha particles may also contribute to SHI damage through
the secondary ions created in the material and it may become signiﬁcant after prolonged exposure.
In Biomedicine the capacity of ion beams to modify materials has important implications, partic-
ularly on the manufacture of structures and devices for biological and biomedical research. The idea
is to fabricate micropatterns on the surface of the irradiated sample that may affect the behavior
(adhesion and migration) of certain cells. So far, most work has been performed on silicon as substrate
material [276]. On the other hand, swift ion beams could be, in principle, interesting alternatives to
electrons and X-rays for diagnosis and therapy [277,278]. In particular, the use of protons and heavier
ions for therapeutical use (hadron therapy) is being seriously considered in several laboratories
around the world. Several ions, C, O, Ar, Si, Ne, in the hundred MeV range have been used, although
most promising results are expected for carbon. Hadrons present a number of advantages with regard
to electromagnetic radiation owing to their small lateral and angular scattering associated to their
travelling in straight lines. Moreover they allow for a better clinical efﬁciency by more precisely ﬁtting
the maximum deposited energy to the location of the cancer tumor. Although the hadrons used for
therapy are relatively light in relation to the production of the electronic effects discussed in this
review, a careful analysis would be needed in order to evaluate the damage caused to human tissues
by such electronic contribution.

8. Summary and conclusions: future perspectives

A main conclusion of the present review is that there is already enough theoretical and experimen-
tal information to conclude that electronic processes during ion beam irradiation constitute a rather
general source of damage by ion beams in dielectric and semiconductor materials. Unfortunately,
the theoretical understanding of the operative microscopic processes is still in a primitive stage. Sev-
eral possible mechanisms have been shown to be reliable candidates to explain several features of the
damage effects in different materials although one should try to understand synergic effects among
several of these mechanisms. It is also clear that every material is singular, requiring speciﬁc study,
and it is difﬁcult to offer universal recipes. The standard thermal spike model offers a simple explana-
tion for the formation of tracks and the existence of a threshold stopping power. However, some fun-
damental aspects and concepts should be revised and placed on a more rigorous basis. The cooperative
processes (phase transformation) leading to the formation of tracks should be more thoroughly inves-
tigated as well as its ﬁnal microscopic structure. In particular, one should pay attention to the connec-
tion between point defect generation and the sudden occurrence of the track and decide whether and
how the two phenomena are coupled. It is also clear that a number of experimental features such as
the occurrence of sub-threshold damage and the cumulative nature of amorphization (track overlap-
ping) suggest other new approaches, although, the thermal spike is still a very fruitful concept.
Thermally-assisted bond-breaking and, particularly, non-radiative exciton recombination models
appear quite reasonable alternatives for sputtering as well as defect and track generation. Exciton

F. Agulló-López et al. / Progress in Materials Science 76 (2016) 1–58

51

models have been, indeed, shown to operate reasonably well in alkali halides, very likely in SiO2, and
LiNbO3, and possibly, other dielectric crystals, although further developments of the model still
require fundamental studies. Specially, a deeper experimental and theoretical analysis of the initial
stages of electronic excitation, including its dynamics in the ﬁrst femtoseconds, is necessary. More
rigorous and powerful MD approaches incorporating the contribution of electronic and ionization
events in the simulations, should be developed. In this new context, the synergy between nuclear
and electronic mechanisms on the structural effects of SHI irradiations becomes very relevant [279].
Finally, the practical application of those physical processes in a number of technologies should be

seriously pursued.
