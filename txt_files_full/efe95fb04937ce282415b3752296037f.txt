1. Differential scanning calorimetry 
 
DCS is a widely used experimental technique to measure thermal and thermodynamic prop-
erties of a wide range of materials. DSC measures heat flow rates to the samples as a func-
tion of the temperature, unlike heat flow itself as in the case of classical calorimetry. To this 
end,  the  heat  flow  to  the  sample  required  maintaining  constant  preset  heating  or  cooling 
rates or the heat flow required to keep the sample temperature constant is measured. There 
are two types of commercially available DSCs, namely 
 

•  heat flux DSCs 
•  power-compensated DSCs 

 

We  will  use  a  Perkin  Elmer  DSC  8500  which  makes  use  of  the  power  compensation  tech-
nique, as discussed in section 1.2. 
 
1.1. Heat flux DSC 
 
Heat flux DSCs contain a heated thermoelectric disk. Sample and reference are placed on the 
thermoelectric  disk  at  their  designated  positions.  The  temperatures  of  the  sample  and  the 
reference  are  measured  constantly  by  thermocouples  placed  directly  beneath  them.  The 
instrumental  signal  is derived  from  the  temperature  difference between sample  and  refer-
ence. Hence, thermal properties of the samples are indirectly acquired.   
 
1.2. Power Compensated DSC 
 
A scheme of a power compensated DSC is shown in Figure 1. The basic setup of the instru-
ment consists of two identical microfurnaces consisting of platinum-iridium alloy.  
 

 

Figure 1. Power-compensated Differential Scanning Calorimeter. 

 
One of the furnaces contains a reference pan with heat capacity C3, while the other furnace 
contains  the  sample  pan  with  heat  capacity  C4.  The  sample  pan  contains  the  sample  to  be 
investigated  with  heat  capacity  CS.  Since  both  the  microfurnaces  and  the  pans  can  be  con-
sidered as being identical, their heat capacities can be considered as being equal: C3 = C4 if T3 
=  T4.    Reference  and  sample  furnaces  are  connected  via  the  heat  resistances  of  reference 
furnace R1 and sample furnace R2 with R2 = R1. The furnaces are separated from each other 

 

2 

and  are  surrounded  by  aluminum  blocks  maintained  at  a  constant  temperature.  Both  fur-
naces  are  equipped  with  sensitive  temperature  sensors  detecting  temperatures  T1  (refer-
ence furnace) and T2 (sample furnace), as well as with heaters supplying electrical powers P1 
to the reference furnace and P2 to the sample furnace. Disturbances from outside will affect 
both furnaces equally and will, therefore, not influence the difference in heating power be-
tween sample furnace and reference furnace ΔP = P2 - P1. ΔP is the quantity to be measured 
since  it  represents  mass  and  specific  heat  capacity  Cs  of  the  sample  material.  Assuming  a 
constant  pressure  p,  Qp  is  the  heat  transferred  from  or  to  the  sample  material,  Hp  its  en-
thalpy change and CS = (δH/δT)p its heat capacity:

If  the  sample  material  does  not  undergo  transitions,  ΔP  during  a  heating  scan  is  positive 
since additional power is required to heat the sample material. During endothermic transi-
tions such as melting, ΔP shows a positive peak (“melting endotherm”). During exothermic 
transitions such as crystallization, ΔP becomes smaller and shows a “negative” peak (“crys-
tallization  exotherm”).  Above  the  glass  transition  temperature,  the  sample  material  has  a 
higher heat capacity than below as additional types of molecular motions become active for 
storage of thermal energy. Thus, ΔP increases as the glass transition is passed upon heating.  
 
2. Model system 
 
Acetaminophen, a widely used pharmaceutical (Paracetamol) will be employed to exempla-
rily  demonstrate  how  crystallization  kinetics  and  thermodynamics  can  be  investigated  by 
means of DSC. 3 – 5 mg acetaminophen will be placed in hermetically sealed DSC pans. Iden-
tical empty pans are used as reference to subtract the baseline contribution.  
 
3.  DSC heating scan of amorphous acetaminophen 
 
Non-isothermal  DSC  measurements,  in  which  the  sample  is  heated or  cooled  at  a  constant 
rate  (typically  10-20  K/min),  allow  identifying  the  temperature  ranges  in  which  transitions 
take place. First-order phase transitions typically appear as peaks, second-order phase tran-
sitions as steps. Moreover, the dynamic glass transition appears as a step as the heat capac-
ity of a glass is commonly below that of a mobile melt. Note that the dynamic glass transition 
is NOT a second-order phase transition. A DSC pan containing acetaminophen and an empty 
pan are placed in the DSC instrument. The acetaminophen is heated to 180 °C, kept at this 
temperature for 3 minutes, and then quenched to -40°C at a rate of 200 K/min to make sure 
that crystallization is prevented. The amorphous sample is then heated to 180 °C at a heat-
ing  rate  of  10  K/min.  The  enthalpies  ΔtransH  of  the  apparent  transitions  occurring  between 
temperatures TL and TH can be calculated as follows:

pies ΔtransS of the apparent transitions. 

3.  Discuss  the  origins  of  the  apparent  transitions  and  compare  their  relative  specific 

transition enthalpies. 

 
4. Melting point depression (Gibbs-Thomson effect) 
 
Perfect crystals have infinite size, i.e., any atom of the crystal is incorporated into a defect-
free  crystalline  lattice.  However,  real  crystals  are  finite  and  have,  therefore,  surfaces.  The 
surface  energy  is  a  destabilizing  contribution  to  the  total  Gibbs  free  energy  G  of  a  crystal 
counteracting its internal energy. Surface energy γ (also called surface tension) is the change 
in G per change in surface area A while Temperature T, pressure p, and the amount of sub-
stance n are kept constant:

A  common  observation  is  that  small  particles  of  a  thermodynamically  stable  phase  sur-
rounded  by  a  metastable  phase  are  less  stable  than  larger  particles  of  the  thermodynami-
cally stable phase surrounded by the metastable phase. This finding is referred to as Gibbs-
Thomson effect. As a consequence of the Gibbs-Thomson effect, crystals with dimensions in 
the sub-100-nm range show melting point depression. Melting temperatures depend, there-
fore,  on  the  crystallite  size  (in  the  case  of  polymeric  lamella  crystals  on  the  lamella  thick-
ness). Neglecting possible shape anisotropy of the crystals and the presence of crystal faces 
different in their surface energies, the crystallites can be modeled as spherical entities with a 
diameter d. Melting occurs at temperatures Tm(d) significantly below the equilibrium melting 
temperature  Tm(∞)    of  a  perfect,  infinite  crystal.  The  melting  point  depression  can  be  de-
scribed by a Gibbs-Thomson equation having the form:

with σcl being the surface tension between crystal and liquid melt, ΔHm the heat of melting 
and ρc the density of the crystalline phase. A possibility to reliably control crystal sizes is to 
confine the crystallizing material to nanopores with a diameter d.

5. Isothermal crystallization kinetics 
 
The crystallinity 

c

of a crystallization process is therefore equivalent to the rate at which 

f  is the portion of the crystallizing material that is crystalline. The kinetics 
f  changes. Crystalli-
zation kinetics is usually investigated by means of isothermal crystallization experiments, in 
f  is determined as a function of the crystallization time t at a preset, constant crys-
which 
f  can be estimated from isothermal DSC meas-

tallization temperature Tc. The crystallinity

enthalpy of melting of an ideal 100 % crystalline sample. To this end, ΔP required to keep the 
sample material at the preset crystallization temperature Tc is measured. Owing to the exo-
thermic nature of crystallization, the heat flow rate to the sample pan is lower than that to 
the  reference  pan  so  that  crystallization  is  indicated  by  an  exothermic  peak.  The  ratios 
 are equivalent to the ratios of the peak areas between t = 0 and t = tc (tc is a 
specific crystallization time) and between t = 0 and t = ∞ (practically the crystallization time 
after which the heat flow rate reaches a constant limit). Alternatively, crystallinity can also 
be  estimated  from  the  strengths  of  the  glass  transition  steps  ΔCp(t)  of  samples  crystallized 
for specific crystallization times t. ΔCp(t) can be determined from heating scans taken after 
isothermal  crystallization  since  below  the  glass  transition  temperature  processes  changing 
crystallinity, first and  foremost  cold  crystallization,  are  commonly  so  slow  that they  can be 
neglected. The following relationship can be used to derive crystallinities:

Crystallization  kinetics  is  usually  well  described  by  the  Avrami  model  (Avrami,  M.  J.  Chem. 
Phys. 1939, 7, 1103-1112). The Avrami model allows predicting the volume fraction occupied 
by  entities  showing  one-dimensional,  two-dimensional  or  three-dimensional  growth  as  a 
function  of  time.  Moreover,  one  can  distinguish  scenarios  in  which  growth  of  all  growing 
objects  starts  instantaneously  (corresponding  to heterogeneous  nucleation)  from  scenarios

in which growth of the growing objects starts sporadically (corresponding to homogeneous 
nucleation).  Assuming  that  crystals  originate  from  germs  and  grow  more  and  more  at  the 
expense of the surrounding metastable melt, the volume the crystals occupy can be consid-
f . Hence, the volume the crystalline material occupies indicates the 
ered as a measure of 

c

relative progress of a crystallization process. The Avrami equation reads as follows:

exp

(kt n

(8) 
 

where k is the crystallization rate constant including contributions of the crystal growth rate, 
the nucleation rate and the number of nuclei. The Avrami exponent n can be considered as 
the  sum  of  two  contributions:  n  =  nd  +  nnucl.  The  spatial  dimensionality  of  crystal  growth  is 
represented  by  nd.  A  value  nd  =  3  corresponds  to  unrestricted  three-dimensional  crystal 
growth, as it is the case if spherulites develop. Lower values of nd are indicative of geometric 
constraint imposed on the growing crystals. An nd value of 2 indicates crystal growth in two 
dimensions, such as in thin-film configurations, whereas an nd value of 1 indicates ideal one-
dimensional growth, for example inside a capillary. The second parameter nnucl is related to 
nucleation kinetics. Whereas nnucl = 0 indicates simultaneous nucleation of all growing crys-
tals, nnucl = 1 is indicative of sporadic nucleation at a constant rate. Taking the double natural 
logarithm of both sides of equation 8 yields:

straight line for the considered range of crystallization times. By using a simple linear fit, 
the Avrami exponent n can be estimated. Discuss what can be concluded from the value 
obtained for n.
