Phonetics: Vowels

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel#/media/File:Cardinal_vowel_tongue_position-front.svg

• Vowels: Sounds of speech produced with open vocal tract
• Vowel quality determined by articulatory features (list not complete

• Height
• Backness
• Roundedness

• Vowels can be acoustically characterized and differentiated by their 

specific composition of formants (= range of frequencies within a 
complex sounds that 

Phonetics: Vowels

• Vowels can be acoustically characterized and differentiated by their 

specific composition of formants (= range of frequencies within a 
complex sounds that contains an absolute or relative maximum in the 
sound spectrum)

Phonology: Consonants

• Consonants: Sounds of speech produced with (partially) closed vocal tract

• determined by articulatory features (list not complete): manner of 

articulation, place of articulation, phonation, voice onset time

(Source: http://www.langsci.ucl.ac.uk/ipa/)

Phonetics: Consonants

• Consonants are classified according to their manner of articulation:

– E.g. Plosives (p t k b d g), fricative (f v s h…), cf. Table on previous slide

• Different types of consonants have different acoustic characteristics, very 

dependent on surrounding sounds , approximants are characterized similarly 
to vowels by periodic sound waves, other consonants, e.g. stops, by their 
impact on the formants of the subsequent vowel. 

Phonetics: Consonants

• Aba ada aga

Phonetics: Suprasegmentals

• Suprasegmental phonology  speech melody, tone, stress intonation, any sound 

variation above the level of the single segment

How do we perceive speech sounds?

• Speech categorization no 

simple task

• Talker variability

• Rate variability

• Context variability

Kuhl, 2005

Coarticulation

• Sounds change their acoustic characteristics in the context of other speech 

sounds

Categorical Perception

• How do we deal with the highly variable speech signal?

• Speech segments are perceived in a categorical way (Liberman et al. 1957): 

Specialization for speech?

Identification                    Discrimination

Categorical Perception

• What exactly is voice onset time?

• ki vs gi

Categorical Perception

• Phonemic status in a language underlies categorical perception: 

• e.g. ra vs. la in English speaking vs. Japanese speaking adults

• Miyawaki et al. 1975: While 

Japanese monolinguals cannot 
discriminate between ra and la, 
English speaking monolinguals 
can.

Suprasegmental phonology

• Musical aspects of speech
• Rhythm and intonation

Prosody marks linguistic units

Der Mann sagt, die Frau ist krank.
The man says the woman is ill.

Der Mann, sagt die Frau, ist krank.
The man, says the woman, is ill.

Possible questions

• When and how do infants learn to discriminate and identify speech sounds 

accurately

• When and how do infants use the prosodic units in their language input?
