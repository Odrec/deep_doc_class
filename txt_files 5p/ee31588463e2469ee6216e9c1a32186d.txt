Narrative Analysis: Story

Meet with everybody who read your 
novel excerpt.

Analyse character, setting, and action. 
(You might want to temporarily 
subdivide your group into three smaller 
groups each dealing with one of these 
subjects.) 

Which aspects appear most important 
in your text extract?
Hazard a guess: Why?

Prepare a transparency to present 
your findings to the course.

 change of setting denotes shift of power between the 
two characters

Approaches to an Interpretation

• The Picture of Dorian Gray  regarded as 

an Aestheticist novel

• Aestheticism: art for art’s sake, art should 

not imitate life but stand independently

• negative connotation in its contemporary 
times (19th century): often connected to 
Hedonism

 needs background research

Example: Dorian Gray

Hedonism

 villain

 The connection sympathetic caracter/Aestheticism vs. 
villain/Hedonism distances Aestheticism from Hedonism

Next steps

• Thesis generation

– The Picture of Dorian Gray might be read as a 

project of Aestheticism which seeks to 
distance Aestheticism from the negative 
connotations people in the late 19th century 
attributed to this literary movement.

 possible starting point for an academic paper on The Picture of 
Dorian Gray

Narrator - Narratee

• Who speaks to whom?
• Which position does the narrator have 
inside or outside the world of the story?

• In which way and in which order does the 

narrator speak about which characters and 
events?

(Meyer 70)

Discourse models

- Stanzel, “Narrative Situations”
- Genette’s model of voice and focalisation 

(Structuralism)

Genette’s Voice and Focalisation 

(Structuralism)

Voice

• Who speaks?

– covert narrator: invisible, a voice that reports information, not 

evaluating

– overt narrator: visible mediator story-reader, sometimes complex 

character 

• From which position?

– heterodiegetic narrator: outside the world of the characters
– homodiegetic narrator: inside the world of the characters

special situation: autodiegetic narrator (telling his/her own story)

•

In which part of the narrative?
– Frame narrative  told by extradiegetic narrator
– Embedded narrative (inside Frame narrative)  intradiegetic

narrator

Genette’s Voice and Focalisation 

(Structuralism)

Focalisation: Who perceives?

•

Internal focalisation: perspective within a character, limited 
perception of the world
– fixed focalisation: different scenes  one perspective
– variable focalisation: different scenes  different perspectives
– multiple focalisation: one scene  different perspectives

• external focalisation: information on the characters’ external 

behaviour, no feelings or thoughts (“dramatic perspective”)

• zero focalisation: perspective can vary

– monologic / comprehensive view
– dialogic / conflicting perspectives

Get together in your group and apply Genette’s

terminology to your assigned short story.
To present your findings to the course, be 

prepared to summarize the topic of your short 
story in one sentence.

Groups:

– A – Hopfauf: Hanif Kureishi. “My Son the Fanatic”
– Huhnold – Kurth: Qaisra Sharaz. “A Pair of Jeans”
– Loh – Schober: Salman Rushdie. “Good Advice is 

Rarer than Rubies”

“During a remarkably severe winter … I was on a visit to Meadow 
Hall; where had assembled likewise a large party of young folk. …
each one in turn told some merry story to divert the company. At
last, after having related all that we could recollect worth reciting, 
and being rather at a loss what to say next, a sprightly girl in
company proposed that every one should relate the history of their 
own lives. ..  I took up my pen … but the various occurrences of my 
life were … not interesting enough. … I broke silence by 
exclaiming, '… The adventures of my life … will be insipid and 
unentertaining to others …: I cannot, therefore, attempt it.'—'Then 
write mine, which may be more diverting,' said a little squeaking 
voice, which sounded as if close to me. I started with surprise, not 
knowing any one to be near me; … when casting my eyes upon the 
ground, in a little hole under the skirting-board, close by the fire, I 
discovered the head of a mouse peeping out. … You may be sure 
that I was much surprised to be so addressed by such an animal; 
but, ashamed of discovering any appearance of astonishment, lest
the mouse should suppose it had frightened me, I answered with 
the utmost composure, that I would write it willingly if it would dictate

Dorothy Kilner. Life and Perambulations of a Mouse.

“But, before I proceed to relate my new little companion's 
history, I must beg leave to assure my readers that, in 
earnest, I never heard a mouse speak in all my life; and 
only wrote the following narrative as being far more 
entertaining, and not less instructive, than my own life 
would have been: and as it met with the high approbation 
of those for whom it was written, I have sent it to Mr. 
Marshall, for him to publish it, if he pleases, for the equal 
amusement of his little customers.” (n.pag.)
