 The history of the variable in psychology 

  Term has its origin in statistics (introduced by the man who originated the correlation 

coefficient) 

  First extensive use of (in-)dependent and intervening variables in 1930s 
  Our measures are a limited sample of possible measures of whatever it is we are interested 

in theoretically 

  We need to explore more deeply the definition of the concept at the theoretical level. 

Types of variables 

  2 types of meanings: primarily of theoretical and conceptual interest or primarily statistical in 

nature. 

  Variables do not readily fall into one category. Sometimes psychologists have taken statistical 

terminology and absorbed it into their professional vocabulary to refer to slightly different 
things.  

Independent and dependent variables 

  Consider true-experiment: manipulated variable = independent variable 
  Measured variable = dependent variable 
  The dependent variable is subject to the influence of the independent variable. The 
independent variable is the manipulated variable and the dependent variable is the 
measured value which is expected to be influenced by the manipulated variables.  

  Not so clear in non-experimental designs 
  Characteristic s of the participant are called subject variables 

Measurement characteristics of variables 

  Measurement is the process of assigning individuals to the categories or values of a variable. 
Different variables have different measurement characteristics which need to be understood 
in order to plan and execute research effectively. 

  Distinction: nominal vs quantitative measurements 

  Nominal variables 

o  Two or more named categories 
o  No mathematical properties 
o  Dichotomous, binominal, binary variables (2 different values) 
o  Multinominal variables ( 

  Quantitative variables 

o  The numbers (scores) or values we assign to each person or case represent increasing 

levels of the variable. 

o  Mathematical/arithmetic operations: average value, sum values,… 
o  Mediator variable: responsible for the relationship between independent and 

dependent variables 

o  Moderator variables: show that the relationship between an independent variable 

and a dependent variable is not consistent throughout the data

Stevens’ theory of scales of measurement 

  Theory of scales of measurement put forward by Stevens in 1946 
  He is the originator of the idea of nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio scales 
  Different in terms of how the measurement would be carried out, different mathematical 

properties 
Least powerful – most powerful (more information) 

 
  Ratio measurement scale 

o  Requirement of intervals, requirement of zero point 

 

Interval measurement scale 

o  Requirement of intervals, real numbers, based on equal steps 

  Ordinal measurement scale 

o  Relative order on some sort if characteristic, rank order, not appropriate for e.g. 

mean 

  Nominal (or category/categorical) measurement scales 

o  Give labels, numbers can be confusing 

  Problem: we don’t know that each mathematical unit is the same as each psychological unit
