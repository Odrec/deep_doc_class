tivity (25) that investigated two tasks with right
hemisphere dominance demonstrated top-down
effects that were specific for the right hemi-
sphere, i.e., from the right middle frontal gyrus
(area 46) on right extrastriate areas. It is thus
likely that our findings generalize to other later-
alized tasks. Although we cannot exclude later-
alization contingent on stimulus type in some
situations, our results are consistent with previ-
ous findings from split-brain patient studies (7)
and positron emission tomography (11) showing
hemispheric specialization based on task de-
mands. Research on hemispheric specialization
should move beyond analyses of asymmetric
regional activations and focus more strongly on
functional
interactions within and between
hemispheres.

Depression: Moderation by a

Polymorphism in the 5-HTT Gene

In a prospective-longitudinal study of a representative birth cohort, we tested
why stressful experiences lead to depression in some people but not in others.
A functional polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter
(5-HT T) gene was found to moderate the inﬂuence of stressful life events on
depression. Individuals with one or two copies of the short allele of the 5-HT T
promoter polymorphism exhibited more depressive symptoms, diagnosable
depression, and suicidality in relation to stressful life events than individuals
homozygous for the long allele. This epidemiological study thus provides ev-
idence of a gene-by-environment interaction, in which an individual’s response
to environmental insults is moderated by his or her genetic makeup.

Depression is among the top five leading causes
of disability and disease burden throughout the
world (1). Across the life span, stressful life
events that involve threat, loss, humiliation, or
defeat influence the onset and course of depres-

sion (2–5). However, not all people who en-
counter a stressful life experience succumb to
its depressogenic effect. Diathesis-stress theo-
ries of depression predict that individuals’ sen-
sitivity to stressful events depends on their ge-
netic makeup (6, 7). Behavioral genetics re-
search supports this prediction, documenting
that the risk of depression after a stressful event
is elevated among people who are at high ge-
netic risk and diminished among those at low
genetic risk (8). However, whether specific
genes exacerbate or buffer the effect of stressful
life events on depression is unknown. In this
study, a functional polymorphism in the pro-

moter region of the serotonin transporter gene
(SLC6A4) was used to characterize genetic vul-
nerability to depression and to test whether
5-HTT gene variation moderates the influence
of life stress on depression.

The serotonin system provides a logical
source of candidate genes for depression, be-
cause this system is the target of selective
serotonin reuptake–inhibitor drugs that are
effective in treating depression (9). The sero-
tonin transporter has received particular at-
tention because it is involved in the reuptake
of serotonin at brain synapses (10). The pro-
moter activity of the 5-HTT gene, located on
17q11.2, is modified by sequence elements
within the proximal 5⬘ regulatory region, des-
ignated the 5-HTT gene-linked polymorphic
region (5-HTTLPR). The short (“s”) allele in
the 5-HTTLPR is associated with lower tran-
scriptional efficiency of the promoter com-
pared with the long (“l”) allele (11).

Evidence for an association between the
short promoter variant and depression is incon-
clusive (12). Although the 5-HTT gene may not
be directly associated with depression, it could
moderate the serotonergic response to stress.
Three lines of experimental research suggest
this hypothesis of a gene-by-environment (G ⫻
E) interaction. First, in mice with disrupted
5-HTT, homozygous and heterozygous (5-HTT
–/– and ⫹/–) strains exhibited more fearful
behavior and greater increases in the stress hor-
mone (plasma) adrenocorticotropin in response
to stress compared to homozygous (5-HTT
⫹/⫹) controls, but in the absence of stress no
differences related to genotype were observed
(13). Second, in rhesus macaques, whose length
variation of the 5-HTTLPR is analogous to that
of humans, the short allele is associated with
decreased serotonergic function [lower cerebro-
spinal fluid (CSF) 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid
concentrations] among monkeys reared in
stressful conditions but not among normally
reared monkeys (14). Third, human neuroim-
aging research suggests that the stress response
is mediated by variations in the 5-HTTLPR.
Humans with one or two copies of the s allele
exhibit greater amygdala neuronal activity to
fearful stimuli compared to individuals ho-
mozygous for the l allele (15). Taken together,
these findings suggest the hypothesis that vari-
ations in the 5-HTT gene moderate psycho-
pathological reactions to stressful experiences.
We tested this G ⫻ E hypothesis among
members of the Dunedin Multidisciplinary
Health and Development Study (16). This
representative birth cohort of 1037 children
(52% male) has been assessed at ages 3, 5, 7,
9, 11, 13, 15, 18, and 21 and was virtually
intact (96%) at the age of 26 years. A total of
847 Caucasian non-Maori study members,
without stratification confounds, were divid-
ed into three groups on the basis of their
5-HTTLPR genotype (11): those with two
copies of the s allele (s/s homozygotes; n ⫽

147; 17%), those with one copy of the s allele
(s/l heterozygotes; n ⫽ 435; 51%), and those
with two copies of the l allele (l/l homozy-
gotes; n ⫽ 265; 31%). There was no differ-
ence in genotype frequencies between the
sexes [␹2(2) ⫽ 0.02, P ⫽ 0.99]. Stressful life
events occurring after the 21st birthday and
before the 26th birthday were assessed with
the aid of a life-history calendar (17), a high-
ly reliable method for ascertaining life-event
histories (18). The 14 events included em-
ployment, financial, housing, health, and re-
lationship stressors. Thirty percent of the
study members experienced no stressful life
events; 25% experienced one event; 20%,
two events; 11%, three events; and 15%, four
or more events. There were no significant
differences between the
three genotype
groups in the number of life events they
experienced, F(2,846) ⫽ 0.56, P ⫽ 0.59,
suggesting that 5-HTTLPR genotype did not
influence exposure to stressful life events.

Study members were assessed for past-year
depression at age 26 with the use of the Diag-
nostic Interview Schedule (19), which yields a
quantitative measure of depressive symptoms
and a categorical diagnosis of a major depres-
sive episode according to Diagnostic and Sta-
tistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV)
criteria (20). 17% of study members (58% fe-
male versus 42% male; odds ratio ⫽ 1.6; 95%
confidence interval from 1.1 to 2.2) met criteria
for a past-year major depressive episode, which
is comparable to age and sex prevalence rates
observed in U.S. epidemiological studies (21).
In addition, 3% of the study members reported
past-year suicide attempts or recurrent thoughts
about suicide in the context of a depressive
episode. We also collected informant reports
about symptoms of depression for 96% of study
members at age 26 by mailing a brief question-
naire to persons nominated by each study mem-
ber as “someone who knows you well.”

We used a moderated regression frame-
work (22), with sex as a covariate, to test the
association between depression and (i) 5-
HTTLPR genotype, (ii) stressful life events,
and (iii) their interaction (table S1). The in-
teraction between 5-HTTLPR and life events
showed that the effect of life events on self-
reports of depression symptoms at age 26 was
significantly stronger (P ⫽ 0.02) among in-
dividuals carrying an s allele than among l/l
homozygotes (Fig. 1A). We further tested
whether life events could predict within-indi-
vidual increases in depression symptoms over
time among individuals with an s allele by
statistically controlling for the baseline num-
ber of depressive symptoms they had before
the life events occurred (table S1). The sig-
nificant interaction (P ⫽ 0.05) showed that
individuals carrying an s allele whose life
events occurred after their 21st birthday ex-
perienced increases in depressive symptoms
from the age of 21 to 26 years (b ⫽ 1.55,

R E P O R T S
SE ⫽ 0.66, t ⫽ 2.35, P ⫽ 0.02 among s/s
homozygotes and b ⫽ 1.25, SE ⫽ 0.34, t ⫽

whereas l/l homozygotes did not (b ⫽ 0.17,
SE ⫽ 0.41, t ⫽ 0.41, P ⫽ 0.68).

The G ⫻ E interaction also showed that
stressful life events predicted a diagnosis of
major depression among carriers of an s allele
but not among l/l homozygotes (P ⫽ 0.056,
Fig. 1B). We further tested whether life
events could predict the onset of new diag-
nosed depression among carriers of an s allele
(table S1). We excluded from analysis study
members who were diagnosed with depres-
sion before age 21. The significant interac-
tion (P ⫽ 0.02) showed that life events oc-
curring after their 21st birthdays predicted
depression at age 26 among carriers of an s
allele who did not have a prior history of
depression (b ⫽ 0.79, SE ⫽ 0.25, z ⫽ 3.16,
P ⫽ 0.002 among s/s homozygotes and b ⫽
0.41, SE ⫽ 0.12, z ⫽ 3.29, P ⫽ 0.001 among
s/l heterozygotes) but did not predict onset of
new depression among l/l homozygotes (b ⫽
0.08, SE ⫽ 0.20, z ⫽ 0.42, P ⫽ 0.67). Further
analyses showed that stressful life events pre-
dicted suicide ideation or attempt among in-
dividuals carrying an s allele but not among
l/l homozygotes (P ⫽ 0.05, Fig. 1C). The
hypothesized G ⫻ E interaction was also
significant when we predicted informant re-
ports of age-26 depression (P ⬍ 0.01), an
analysis that ruled out the possibility of self-
report bias (Fig. 1D). The interaction showed
that the effect of life events on informant
reports of depression was stronger among
individuals carrying an s allele than among l/l
homozygotes. These analyses attest that the
5-HTT gene interacts with life events to pre-
dict depression symptoms, an increase in
symptoms, depression diagnoses, new-onset
diagnoses, suicidality, and an informant’s re-
port of depressed behavior.

This evidence that 5-HTTLPR variation
moderates the effect of life events on depres-
sion does not constitute unambiguous evi-
dence of a G ⫻ E interaction, because expo-
sure to life events may be influenced by
genetic factors; if individuals have a heritable
tendency to enter situations where they en-
counter stressful life events, these events may
simply be a genetically saturated marker (23,
24). Thus, what we have identified as a
gene ⫻ environment interaction predicting
depression could actually reflect a gene ⫻
“gene” interaction between the 5-HTTLPR
and other genes we did not measure. We
reasoned that, if our measure of life events
represents merely genetic risk,
then life
events would interact with 5-HTTLPR even
if they occurred after the depression episode.
However, if our measure of life events rep-
resents environmental stress, then the timing
of life events relative to depression must
follow cause-effect order and life events that
