THE KOSOVO EXODUS 

 

1 

 

 

BACKGROUND 

Between December 2014 and February 2015 Kosovo experienced a sudden and unexpected mass out-

migration  of  Kosovo  nationals  to  Western  Europe.  During  these  few  months  an  estimated  100,000 

Kosovars  left  the  country  in  what  was  later  referred  to  as  the  Kosovo  exodus.  This  sudden  exodus  of 

Kosovars was believed to been spurred by a combination of influencing factors. Firstly, the relaxation of 

travel regulation for Kosovars to Serbia, as part of the Brussels agreement, allowed Kosovo nationals to 

reach  the  EU  via  (irregular)  crossing  of  the  Serbian-Hungarian  border.  Secondly,  rumors  and 

misinformation spread about EU Member States’ Safe Country of Origin-lists led to a general misbelief 

that  Kosovars  were  able  to  access  asylum  or  other  legal  statuses  in  specific  EU  Member  States.  And 

indeed, the mass-migration outflow of Kosovars were directly reflected in the sharp increase of asylum 

applications  of  Kosovo  nationals  to  the  EU  (in  particular  to  Germany)  with  a  total  of  37,905  asylum 

applications  of  Kosovo  nationals  in  2014,  72,710  in  2015,  compared  to  the  corresponding  number  of 

20,2015  applications in 2013.  As a direct consequence, returns to Kosovo from the EU  have increased 

significantly with a total of 18,789 returns in 2015 (9,040 forced and 9,749 voluntary) compared to the 

4,610 return 2014.  

 

However,  migration  from the  Western  Balkans  to  Europe  is  not  a  new  phenomenon.  With  its  conflict 

history Kosovo1, like other Western Balkan countries, has a large diaspora residing in Europe. Moreover, 

despite processes of peace and stabilisation and a solid economic growth over the last decade, Kosovo 

remains the poorest country in the region with about 30 percent of its population living in poverty and 10 

percent  in  extreme  poverty2.  Unemployment  rates  are  also  the  highest  in  the  region  with  total 

unemployment rates above 30 percent and youth unemployment (15-24 years) above 55 percent. These 

poor conditions and lack of economic opportunities in combination with a large Kosovar diaspora well 

integrated in Western European societies, have contributed to a steady but ‘silent’ flow of out-migration 

of Kosovars to Europe. A year has now passed since the end of the Kosovo exodus, yet, what is known 

about this extraordinary mass-migration is still limited and largely based media reporting, a few smaller 

studies and anecdotal evidence. This study aims to firstly confirm or dismiss general assumptions about 

                                                           
1 IOM refers to the UNSC resolution 1244-administered Kosovo in an abbreviated manner as “Kosovo/UNSCR 
1244”.  For the purpose of this document, this shall be shortened to “Kosovo*” - this designation being without 
prejudice to positions on status and in line with UNSCR 1244 and the ICJ Opinion on the Kosovo declaration of 
independence.

the  causes  and  dynamics  of  the  Kosovo  exodus  in  order  to  be  able  to  increase  the  evidence  base  for 

programme and policy makers in the field of migration.    

 

WHAT DO WE KNOW? 

The Friedrich Ebert Stiftung in Kosovo conducted interviews with Kosovars in bus stations in Pristina and 

Belgrade, and in asylum centres in Munich, Berlin and Palic (total sample size 30 respondents). The study 

suggests that most Kosovars who left during the exodus were poor, long-term unemployed (unemployed 

for  more  than  3  years)  males,  with  secondary  education  and  with  one  or  zero  working  person  in  the 

household.  According  to  the  study,  the  main  motivations  for  migrating  to  Europe  were  economic, 

although  the  political  situation  and  the  six  months  political  stalemate  also  influenced  the  decision  to 

migrate as it contributed to the feeling of ‘no hope’. 97 percent of respondents thought about migrating 

1-6 months before.  Results from UNDP Public Pulse Report –IX-, asking families and friends left behind, 

similarly showed that 75 percent were men, unemployed and with secondary education. The report also 

shows that 79 percent migrated to Germany, followed by France and Switzerland. KFOS and Reinvest, who 

interviewed Kosovars throughout the wave (from end of 2014 to beginning of 2015) suggested that the 

profile of Kosovars migrants changed drastically. There are evidence of a new migration trend of migrants 

from the K-RAE communities that started to leave Kosovo from the second half of 2014, followed by new 

cohorts  of  migrants.  While  the  typical  profile  of  the  first  early  cohorts  of  Kosovars  leaving  during  the 

exodus was male, age 25-35, with primary education and a family income below the poverty line, living 

poverty or even extreme poverty, later cohorts were better educated, employed and wealthier, and to a 

higher extent migrated with their families. During the first quarter of 2015 more than 5,300 children were 

withdrawn from school. Furthermore, as the out migration flow increased sharply the price for smugglers 

dropped drastically from an estimated 3,000 to 600 euro per person.   

The aforementioned studies conducted about the Kosovo exodus, together with anecdotal evidence and 

media coverage, provide important insights into the reasons behind individual migration-decisions, and 

give a coherent picture of the profiles of those leaving. Nevertheless, due to small and narrow sample 

sizes,  results  are  not  generalizable,  and though  unemployment  and  lack  of opportunities  undoubtedly 

seem to  be  the main  reason  behind  the  decision to migrate,  studies  fail  to  explain  the  sudden, mass-

movement of Kosovars to Europe.

PURPOSE  

The overall aim of this paper is to contribute to a better understanding of the extra-ordinary migration 

movement that took place during November 2014 to February 2015 – the so called Kosovo exodus –to 

inform policies and programmes in order to better assist, and respond to the needs of, Kosovar migrants, 

potential  migrants  and  returning  migrants.  More  specifically  the  paper  aim  to  confirm  and  build  on 

existing evidence on migrant profiles, reasons behind the decision to migrate, and the dynamics of the 

Kosovo exodus, particularly in terms of identifying various individual and structural factors in play in the 

micro-level migration decision-making process. Moreover, the study aims to shed light on the operations 

of human smugglers - not with regards to mapping criminal networks of human smugglers – but rather 

for the purpose of accounting for the extent to which smugglers play a significant role in facilitating, or 

even promoting, irregular migration, such as the Kosovo exodus. Furthermore, the study aims to capture 

how returnees themselves ‘asses’ their recent migration experience - whether they perceive it as a failed 

or successful migration project - and how it has affected their aspirations and proneness to re-migrate. 

The  study  will  cover  the  entire  migration  cycle:  from  the  migration  decision  making  process  to  the 

migration journey, the time abroad, to the return to Kosovo and the reintegration process. By doing so 

the  aim  of  this  study  is  to  challenge  and  test  common  assumptions  -  often  overly  positive  or  overly 

negative – in particular assumptions about the (financial) situation of Kosovars returning to Kosovo. From 

a policy perspective it is of course highly relevant to get a proper understanding of the root causes as well 

the triggering factors of an out-migration trend of such scale as the Kosovo exodus, in order to prevent it 

from happening again. However, it is equally important to gain an objective understanding of the situation 

Kosovars will find themselves in after their return, in particular to meet specific needs and vulnerability, 

and/or to how their recent migration experience – so be positive or negative – have affected their desire 

and aspiration to re-migrate.

METHODOLOGY 

The  main method  for this study  was  quantitative  survey interviews with Kosovars who migrated from 

Kosovo to Europe during the ‘Kosovo exodus’ - defined here as between November 2014 and February 

2015 - and returned through an IOM Assisted Voluntary Return and Reintegration (AVRR) programme. A 

total of 146  quantitative interviews were held between 16 October 2015 and 15 January 2016 in IOM 

premises  in  Pristina,  or  in  any  of  the  IOM  Kosovo  field  offices.  Survey  interviews  were  conducted  in 

connection  to  returnees’  visits  to  IOM  Kosovo  offices  receiving  reintegration  assistance.  For  ethical 

reasons,  and  to  avoid  sample  biases,  both  anonymity  and  voluntariness  was  duly  stressed  by  the 

enumerators who underlined that answers would not in any way affect eligibility or level of reintegration 

assistance.  As  enumerators  were  IOM  AVRR  staff,  there  is  of  course  still  a  risk  that  the  method  of 

recruitment may have affected the  answers  –  particularly  the  risk of under/over reporting of financial 

costs/incomes  –  which  ought  to  be  taken  into  account  when  interpreting  the  results.  Moreover,  only 

interviewing Kosovars returning to Kosovo through IOM AVRR programmes is clearly excluding 1) Kosovars 

who left during the exodus but who are still residing in Europe and 2) those who have returned to Kosovo 

through  forced  repatriation.  This  bias  is  likely  to  be  reflected  in  the  characteristics  of  the  sample,  as 

Kosovar migrants likely to have more positive migration experiences (those still residing in Europe) and 

those likely to have more negative migration experiences (those forcibly returned) are excluded from this 

sample, which should rather be considered as representing ‘returning Kosovars’ rather than the larger 

‘Kosovo exodus’.  

 

Lastly,  the  survey  questionnaire  consist  of  79  questions,  including  multiple-choice,  closed-  and  open-

ended questions. The listed response options to the multiple-choice questions derived from the literature 

review  and  hypotheses  based  in  theories.  Additionally,  all  multiple-choice  questions  had  the  option 

“Other (please specify)”. The questionnaire includes objective questions such as level of income, cost of 

transportation  etc.  as  well  as  subjective  questions  such  as  perception  of  well-being  relative  to  other 

families in the community.

FINDINGS AND RESULTS  

Demographic and socio-economic profile  

The  survey  questionnaire  collected  relevant  demographic  data,  including  gender,  age  and  ethnicity  as 

showed  in  Figure  1-3.  As  expected  the  majority  of  migrants  are  male  K-Albanians,  but  the  number  of 

Kosovo-Roma and K-Ashkali migrants are also significant. The vast majority of the sample falls within the 

age range of 20-29 and 30-39 years, with the average age of 32 years.

Looking at the socio-economic profiles of respondents, about 50 percent have secondary education, 31 

percent primary education and 14 percent no education at all (Figure 4), with women and minorities being 

over-represented in the latter group. Moreover, 63 percent were working prior to their migration - 38 

percent had full-time positions while 23 percent had temporary or seasonal work (Figure 5)  – and had an 

 

6 

average monthly income of 241 euro per month. Considering that the average monthly wage in Kosovo is 

450  euro  per  month3  and  that  the  unemployment  rate  is  35  percent  (youth4  unemployment  rate  61 

percent5), both rate of employment and monthly earnings of Kosovars migrating during the exodus are 

unexpectedly high. While previous reporting suggests that the majority of Kosovars who left during the 

exodus were poor, long-term unemployed, young men, these findings rather indicate that migrants are 

both older and wealthier than previous cohorts of Kosovo migrants. This underpins the assumption that 

the  pioneer  Kosovo  migrants  were  poor  and  unemployed  K-Romas  and  K-Albanians  who  were  then 

followed by wealthier and better educated K-Albanians whose decision to migrate were heavily influenced 

by circulating misinformation and rumors, spread by smuggling networks.

Migration decision-making 

Almost 60 percent made the decision to migrate in less than a week, and almost 30 percent in less than a 

month. Close to no one spoke the language of his or her intended country of destination and when asked 

about the level of knowledge about the country 70 percent answered “No knowledge at all”, 22 percent 

“Basic knowledge”, and only 8 percent “Good knowledge”.

About 30 percent of the respondents got information about the country of destination from friends and 

relatives  in  Kosovo  and  about  35  percent  from  friends  and  relatives  in the  destination  country.  Other 

sources of information were traditional and social media. Rather unsurprisingly, but still disappointing, is 

that when asked about information from migrant service centres or embassies, no one of the respondent 

had  considered  using  it.  29  percent  financed  their  migration  partly  through  savings,  while  most  (57 

percent) took informal loans or sold property (33 percent) in order to afford their journey.

This strengthens the hypothesis that most people who left during the Kosovo exodus made the decision 

to  migrate  spontaneously  and  based  on  very  limited  knowledge,  or  no  knowledge  at  all,  about  the 

destination country in question. Unsurprisingly, the most common stated reasons for leaving were lack of 

economic opportunities (58 percent), but the belief or hope to attain asylum or any other legal status in 

 

8 

the destination country was influencing the decision to migrate for a significant number (10 percent). 67 

percent  answered  migrated  with  the  intention  to  stay  permanently  and  “with  no  plans  to  return  to 

Kosovo”.  This,  in  combination  with  the  fact  that  over  50  percent  left  the  country  together  with  their 

immediate family, and that 33 percent sold assets to finance their migration, strongly indicates that they 

left in belief that they were not returning to Kosovo.

As  defined  by  de  Haas  (2011)  changes  in  migration  policies  -  or  in  the  case  of  the  Kosovo  exodus, 

misinformation  about  changes  in  migration  policies  –  have  the  tendency  to  produce  unintended 

‘migration  substitution effects’.  For example, introduction of more restrictive policies tend to result in 

either diversion of migration flows to alternative destinations or a shift from regular to irregular migration 

flows.  A  third  substitution  effect  is,  when  in  anticipation  of  potential  tightening  of  migration  policies, 

migration to that destination country increase drastically instead of decreases, a phenomenon referred 

to as ‘now or never’ or ‘beat the ban’ migration. While the underlying push-factors such as unemployment 

and lack of economic opportunities offers a part of the explanation of the Kosovo exodus it fails to explain 

its  scale  and  suddenness.  The  frenzy  created  by  rumors  of  what  was  promised  in  Germany  is  better 

explained by the theory of the ‘now or never’ substitution effect ultimately resulting in people making the 

decision  to  migrate  within  a  week,  selling  assets,  quitting  their  job  and  moving  with  their  family  to 

Germany, afraid of missing the last opportunity to gain legal status in Germany.

Route to Europe 

Typically, Kosovars travelled with bus to Serbia, with Kosovo ID-cards or birth certificates, to then cross 

the  Serbian-Hungarian  border  irregularly  by  foot.  From  Hungary,  migrants  travelled  to  their  final 

destination country by train (65 percent), bus (6 percent) or car (24 percent).   

57  percent  of  the  respondents  confirmed  they  paid  agents  or  smugglers  to  facilitate  their  journey, 

including official and unofficial border crossings. 88 percent confirmed they paid an agent or smuggler 

and two percent reported they bribed border police or other officials, while the remaining 10 percent 

either refused to answer or paid ‘others’. The amounts paid to smugglers vary drastically in range from an 

average fee of 900 euros to as high as 4,000 euros per person.

Stay abroad  

As all respondents of this study returned to Kosovo through an IOM AVR programme after having their 

asylum claim rejected - effectively excluding any potential cases of Kosovars still residing in Europe with 

potentially more positive experiences – the sample of the study is rather skewed. However, if the general 

expectations on the migration project were legal status and better job opportunities, the reality faced 

with in the destination country differed drastically from those expectations. Out of the 146, only 7 were 

able  to  financially  support  themselves  through  work  in  the  informal  sector.  90  percent  of  the  sample 

stayed in asylum reception centres or in other government housing solutions and supported themselves 

through social benefits from their respective country of destination.

Post-migration experience 

While bearing in mind that reintegrating, both socially and economically can be a timely process, and that 

interviews with respondents were conducted within a month after their return to Kosovo, results with 

respects to migrants’ post-migration experience presents a rather gloomy picture. As mentioned earlier, 

60 percent of  the  sample was working full or part time prior to their migration. In contrast,  only nine 

percent was working post-migration6. The sample’s average length of stay abroad was 11 months, and 

few of those working prior to their migration had the possibility to resume their old positions upon return 

as they had been filled by someone else. Additionally, of those self-employed, such as small-scale farmers, 

many sold their equipment in order to finance their migration and returned to Kosovo with no means left 

to support themselves. Adding to that, more than 60 percent are in debt due to their failed migration 

investment as their journey was financed by informal loans (84 percent), sold property or other assets (48 

percent) and that the total cost of their migration was higher than they expected (54 percent).

When asked about their financial situation, the 78 percent stated they are “struggling” while about 20 

percent claimed to be “coping”. Relative to their financial situation pre-migration, 59 percent believe they 

are now “worse off” and 38 percent “the same as before”. The results clearly suggest that the migration 

project of those returning to Kosovo should be considered as failed as the vast majority find themselves 

in conditions similar or worse, or even considerably worse off. On the other hand, when asked about their 

quality of life 53 percent consider it to be the same as prior to their migration, and relative to others in 

the same community, 74 percent believe their quality of life is comparable to that of their neighbours. 

This indicates that though the migration experience seems to have had a negative impact on respondent’s 

financial situation, it does not seem to have been largely impacting their relative socio-economic status.

One  of  the  aims  of  this  study  was  to  investigate  returning  Kosovars  subjective  perception  of  their 

migration  experience  and  how  it  has  affected  their  desire  and  proneness  to  re-migrate.  Viewing  the 

migration decision making process as being influenced by a number of factors, and accounting for the 

migrants’  individual  capabilities  and  aspirations  to  migrate,  the  hypothesis  was  that  even  though  the 

migration ‘project’ objectively should be considered as failed where migrants are worse off than prior to 

their  migration,  the  migration  experience  may  very  well  have  influenced  their  aspirations  to  migrate 

 

12 

leaving  them  with  a  lower  financial  capabilities,  but  higher  aspirations,  to  migrate.  And  interestingly, 

though it is clear at this point that the time abroad did not live up to expectations, 42 percent still claim 

to be satisfied, and 13 percent highly satisfied with their migration experience. However, as seen in Figure 

18, when asked about how the migration experience have affected their desire to re-migrate 48 percent 

now have less desire to migrate, 21 percent is unchanged, and 31 percent have a greater desire to re-

migrate.

While 58 percent expressed a wish to re-migrate, only 6 percent have actually taken concrete actions to 

realise that wish. Again, considering that interviews took place within a month after return this is rather 

unsurprising. However more telling is perhaps that when asked if they, based on their recent migration 

experience, would recommend a friend to make the same journey, only 14 percent would said they would. 

The reasoning of those who would recommend were along the lines of “Why not, give it a try”, “It’s worth 

trying” and “It’s risky but you never know...”

MAIN FINDINGS  

6%

94%

No

Yes

 

- 

The  typical  Kosovo  exodus  migrant  is  male,  between  20  and  39,  K-Albanian  with  secondary 

education, and is working part- or full time for an average monthly salary of 241 euro per month.  

- 

The decision to migrate was typically made less than a month - in most cases even less than a 

week - before migrating, without speaking the language, and with limited or no knowledge at all 

about the country of destination. 

- 

The  main  source  of  information  about  possibilities  to  migrate  and  about  the  country  of 

destination came from friends and family, both in Kosovo and in the destination country. No one 

used official sources such as embassies or migrant service centres.  

- 

People travelled with bus to Serbia,  crossed the  Serbian-Hungarian border  by foot  wherefrom 

they travelled by train or bus to their final country of destination (87 percent went to Germany).  

- 

Kosovars  paid  900-4,000  euro  per  person  to  a  smuggler  to  facilitate  their  migration,  or 

alternatively (in a few cases) paying bribes to police at the border crossing between Serbia and 

Hungary.  

-  Most people financed their migration through informal loans from friends or relatives or by selling 

property or other assets. 

-  While 60 percent were working part of full time prior to their migration, only 9 percent had found 

a job after their return to Kosovo, mostly because their positions have been filled by someone 

else, or for those self-employed, such as small-scale farmers, because they sold their equipment 

to finance their migration. 

- 

In the country of destination, the vast majority lived in asylum reception centres and close to no 

one were able to work, either in the formal or information job market.

However,  their  quality  of  life  is  considered  to  be  the  same  relative  to  their  situation  before 

migration,  and to others in the same community,  indicating that the migration has not largely 

affected their relative socio-economic status.  

-  Despite finding themselves in a worse financial situation and the unfulfilled expectations on the 

time  abroad,  most  are  satisfied  (42  percent),  or  even  highly  satisfied  (13  percent)  with  their 

migration, and have a wish to re-migrate in the future.
