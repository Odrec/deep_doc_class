Materials and Methods 

 
Expression and purification  
ParM (UniProt PARM_ECOLX), its mutants and ParR (UniProt STBB_ECOLX) were expressed from the plasmids 
pJSC1 and pJSC21, respectively (10), in E. coli BL21-AI cells and purified as described previously (1, 7). Brief 
details of the purification are described below. 
ParM and ParR were finally gel filtrated into a common buffer (Buffer MR: 50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM KCl, and 1 
mM MgCl2, pH 7.0), and this buffer was used in all further experiments. Concentrated aliquots of pure protein were 
frozen and stored at -80 °C.  
Wild type ParM: Wild type ParM was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation (at a final concentration of 10 % 
(sat.)  ammonium  sulfate)  of  the  lysate,  followed  by  addition  of  ATP  to  the  resuspended  pellet. The  polymerized 
ParM was pelleted by centrifugation at 50,000 g, and the resulting pellet containing pure protein was resuspended in 
buffer and gel filtrated on a Sephacryl S-200 column (GE Healthcare). Wild type ParM used for TIRF experiments 
was  purified  from  the  lysate  using  a  HiTrap  Q  HP  column  (GE  Healthcare),  instead  of  ammonium  sulfate 
precipitation. The fractions containing ParM were pooled and further purified using the ATP polymerization step. 
ParM used for ITC and TIRF experiments were treated with EDTA and then gel filtrated on a Superdex 200 10/300 
GL column (GE Healthcare), to ensure complete removal of nucleotide.  
ParM(L163R)  mutant:  The  N-terminally  6xHis-tagged  protein  was  expressed  from  plasmid  pJMJ101  (pTTQ19 
derivative). The protein was purified using a 5 ml HisTrap column (GE Healthcare), and eluted using a gradient of 
imidazole.  The  fractions  containing  ParM  were  pooled  and  further  purified  using  a  HiTrap  Q  HP  column  (GE 
Healthcare), and then dialyzed into 10 mM Tris HCl, 10 mM KCl, 1mM MgCl2, pH 7.5. 
ParM(L163A) mutant: Instead of the polymerization step using ATP in the protocol for the wild type ParM, after 
ammonium  sulfate  precipitation  the  sample  was  purified  using  a  HiTrap  Q  HP  (GE  Healthcare)  column  with 
sufficient dilution to allow binding. The pure fractions were pooled after elution, concentrated and gel filtrated.  
ParM(S19R,G21R) and ParM(S19E,G21E) mutants: the same purification protocol as described for the ParM wild 
type protein was followed. 
ParR: 1,10-phenanthroline was included as a protease inhibitor in the lysis buffer to prevent proteolytic cleavage of 
ParR.  As  described  previously  (7),  the  purification  steps  included  a  HiTrap  Heparin  column  and  HiTrap  SP  HP 
cation  exchange  column,  and  gel  filtration  (Sephacryl  S300,  all  GE  Healthcare).  The  size  of  purified  full-length 
ParR was confirmed by ESMS mass spectrometry since proteolysis occurs easily.  
 
Crystallization, data collection and structure refinement 
Crystallization conditions were identified from a high-throughput screen (25) using 100 nl of protein and 100 nl of 
the crystallization solution, in sitting drop vapor diffusion MRC plates. 
ParM-AMPPNP complex: ParM(L163R) was stored in 10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, pH 7.5, and 5 
mM  AMPPNP  (adenosine  5′-(β,γ-imido)  triphosphate,  tetralithium  salt)  and  10  mM  MgCl2  were  added  prior  to 
crystallization.  Crystals  were  obtained  in  20  %  PEG  6000,  100  mM  Bicine  pH  8.6,  1  M  LiCl,  at  10  mg/ml
