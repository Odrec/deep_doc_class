Abstract 
This article examines the ways in which discourses of  urban development and socio-
spatial  discipline  are  wrapped  around  infrastructure  development  projects  associated 
with recent, future, and proposed international mega-events in Rio de Janeiro.  In the 
past  few  years  the  city  and  state  governments  of   Rio  de  Janeiro  invested  billions  of  
dollars in sporting, tourist, transportation and security infrastructures for the 2007 Pan 
American Games and  hundreds of  millions of  dollars  preparing  for  the 2014 World 
Cup  and  bidding  (twice)  for  the  2016  Olympics.    By  looking  at  the  historical  trajec-
tory of  mega-events in Rio de Janeiro, I argue that there has been a discernable shift 
in  the  ideologies  that  drive  the  production  of   mega-events  in  the  city.    These  logics 
have  discursively  and  materially  shifted  from  more  localized  expressions  of   notions 
of   social  inclusion  and  industrial  democracy  in  the  mid-20th  century  to  reflect  the 
socio-spatial  exigencies  of   capital  in  a  period  of   accelerated  globalization.    I  suggest 
that mega-events impose a neo-liberal “shock doctrine”, installing temporary regimes 
of   extra-legal  governance  that  permanently  transform  socio-space  in  Rio  de  Janeiro.

Sumário 
Este artigo examina como discursos sobre desenvolvimento urbano e disciplina socio-
espacial são usados para promover projetos de infrastructura associados com os mega-
eventos internacionais no Rio de Janeiro.  Nos últimos anos os governos da cidade e 
do estado do Rio de Janeiro investiram bilhões de dólares em infrastruturas esportivas, 
túristicas, de transporte e de segurança para os Jogos Panamericanos e centenas de mil-
hões dos dólares para a Copa do Mundo de 2014 e em duas tentativas de conseguir os 
Jogos Olímpicos.  Ao analisar a trajetória histórica dos mega-eventos no Rio de Janeiro, 
eu mostro que as ideologias que dirigem a sua produção sofreram mudanças profundas. 
Elas se transformaram, discursivamente e materialmente, de noções de inclusao social e 
de democracia industrial no meio do século 20 para refletir as exigencias socio-spaciais 
do capital em um período de globalização acelerada.  Ao final, eu sugiro que os mega-
eventos imponem uma “doutrina choque” neo-liberal, que instala formas de governo 
extra-legal, transformando permanentemente o socio-espaço do Rio de Janeiro.

Theoretical approaches to mega-events
 
Sporting mega-events have generally escaped the attention of  geographers, yet 
they involve some of  the most expensive, complex, and transformative processes that

cities and nations undertake.  In the case of  the Summer Olympics or Pan American 
Games, there arises a city within a city, a highly specific “Olympic geography” with its 
own laws, norms, codes, boundaries, and disciplines.  Typically, an “Olympic Village” 
connects  to  stadia  through  highways  and  modes  of   public  transportation  created 
specifically for the Games.  Special traffic lanes are dedicated to the “Olympic family” to 
ensure their swift movement through the city.  Stadia and performance venues connect 
to media production facilities, cultural sites, and tourist accommodations through the 
machinations of  urban political economy.  Spectators, commentators, and athletes come 
from all over the planet to participate in ritualized expressions of  nationalism and human 
performance in a highly securitized environment.  Each mega-event carries the legacies 
of  past events and together form a central element of our collective global memory. 
 
The scale and extent of  mega-events necessarily transform the city in which 
they are ensconced. As Beijing 2008 and Athens 2004 very clearly demonstrated, low 
income neighborhoods are ‘cleared’ in order to make way for mega-event infrastructures 
and renovation.  Tens of  thousands are displaced, either through the physical destruction 
of   their  homes  or  through  market  mechanisms  such  as  rent  inflation.    The  massive 
infusion of  public money into construction projects is a boon for developers who are 
able to leverage the event to realize projects that under ordinary circumstances would be 
prohibitively expensive or fraught with bureaucratic delay.  The driving mantra of  mega-
events is “accelerated development” – a mantra that uncritically places public money in 
the service of  private profit creating “neo-liberal dreamworlds” (Davis and Monk 2007) 
wherein democratic processes are suspended, public space militarized, and urban space 
restructured in the image of  global capital. 
 
Given the urban,  social, cultural, economic, historical, spatial, political, and 
performative  complexities  of   mega-events,  I  will  focus  on  the  ways  in  which  these 
events  transform  urban  space  and  attempt  to  structure  both  material  and  discursive 
social  relations.    I  argue  that  the  production  of   space  cannot  be  separated  from  the 
production of  social relations.  In the context of  mega-events, the production of  socio-
spatial relationships occurs with the intention of  structuring or reforming urban socio-
space.  The socio-spatial exigencies of  the mega-event are necessarily reflective of  the 
historical and political contexts in which they occur. In order to demonstrate how the 
spatial and discursive elements of  mega-events in Rio de Janeiro have changed to reflect 
the exigencies of  global capital in an era of  accelerated globalization, I trace the history 
of  mega-events in the city over the course of 90 years. 
 
Olympic maps are excellent indications of  the extent to which mega-events 
produce geographic imaginaries and comprise a parallel city (Figures 1 and 2).  Mega-
events  have  as  their  focus  the  stadia  and  venues  in  which  the  games  take  place  yet 
these places are only part of  the event geography.  I call the complexes that arise with 
mega-event  production  “sportive  constellations”.    Physically,  sportive  constellations 
are comprised of  places, spaces, and the systems of  flows that connect them.  They 
are  the  tangible,  physical  elements  of   the  Olympic  city  including  new  and  upgraded 
communications  and  transportation  infrastructure,  stadia,  tourist  amenities,  cultural 
installations,  environmental  remediation  projects,  housing  developments,  and  security 
apparatuses. 
Considered in this light, the term “mega-event” is somewhat of  a misnomer.  
 
Though the term is a useful placeholder, mega-events are lengthy disciplinary processes 
that incorporate mechanisms of  power into spatial and social forms.  These mutually 
reinforcing mechanisms have economic rationality and social control as their end goals.  
The multitude of  practices and techniques that produce and result from the mega-event 
process are nearly impossible to describe in their entirety as they encompass multiple

layers  of   governance,  massive  urban  change,  staggering  sums  of   public  and  private 
money, and function as historically situated festivals that appeal to a global audience.  The 
discursive frameworks that drive this process are also historically contingent. The host 
city or country adapts the dominant discursive framework of  the governing institution 
(e.g. IOC, FIFA) while adding specific elements that maximize the uniqueness of  place 
while at the same time appealing to the perceived universality of  the mega-event and the 
appropriateness of  its articulation in a particular time and place. 

Socio-spatial discipline
 
Social,  material,  and  representational  practices  are  inseparable  from  their 
spatial  contexts  or  referents.    The  shapes,  textures,  meanings,  uses,  and  functions  of  
bounded  and  unbounded  spaces  are  products  of   particular  economic,  political,  and 
social  rationales  (Foucault  1995:  143-145).    Geographers  have  long  read  patterns  of  
land  use  and  territoriality,  material  and  representational  practice,  and  the  production, 
transformation and reproduction of  spatial relationships to identify geographic processes 
operating at multiple scales.  A critical geography of  mega-events necessarily addresses 
the instrumental rationality of  hosting the event, the socio-spatial dynamics it seeks to 
impose, and the possibilities for developing more socially just alternatives (Broudehoux 
2007, Gold and Gold 2007, Leyinski 2008).
 
Power  operates  through  the  creation  of   “governable  spaces”  that  are 
inseparable in their material and representational formations wherein the creation of  
governable  spaces  also  produces  governable  subjects  (Lefebvre  1977,  Bobrow-Strain 
2007: 43).  Thus the emergence of  sportive constellations on the urban landscape is a 
product and process of  producing governable spaces and through them, social discipline.  
From  Foucault  (2007)  we  know  that  multiple  forms  and  techniques  of   governance 
operate  simultaneously  to  preserve  power  relations.    These  relationships  take  spatial 
forms that have enduring effects on the exercise, contestation and communication of  
power. 
 
Recent scholarship on stadiums sheds light on the ways in which landscapes 
of  sport impact the city spatially and culturally.  Gaffney (2008) has shown how urban 
political economy and popular culture combine in the stadiums of  Rio de Janeiro and 
Buenos  Aires  to  influence  cultural  identities,  nationalist  discourses,  ritualized  identity 
performance, and the production and consumption of  spectacles in public space.  In 
this conception, the stadium is much more than a material form as it represents and 
reproduces  the  social  structures  and  material  practices  that  brought  it  into  existence. 
Because stadiums are the most visible, expensive, and problematic elements of  mega-
events (especially to international audiences) they are excellent places to begin a wider 
interrogation of  the processes involved in producing them. 
 
When  we  focus  these  perspectives  on  sportive  constellations,  we  see  a 
multitude of  geographic processes articulating in places that have tended to deflect critical 
attention.  The dominant discourses of  sport have the effect of  neutralizing spaces of  
recreation and leisure, placing them outside the realm of  critical geography.  Yet, as nodes 
in urban systems, stadiums provide privileged insight into urban power relations because 
they  are  material  and  symbolic,  instrumental  and  practical,  discursive  and  emotional. 
The goal of  using stadiums as windows into patterns of  urban political economy, social 
relations, and cultural processes is to expose the underlying power relations that direct 
behavior, produce space, and shape ideologies.  That is, a critical geography of  sporting 
infrastructures seeks to understand the production, use, and maintenance of  power.
 
In addition to the above, this discussion situates mega-events in larger debates 
about the production and governance of  public space in Latin America and the production

of  “Olympic cities” (Herzog 2005, Davis and Monk 2007, Gold and Gold 2007). Social 
and spatial discipline have long been recognized as important themes in Latin American 
urban planning (Needell 1995, Outtes 2003).  It is important to remember that while 
stadiums are bounded spatial entities or territories, they function as extensible spaces, 
connecting to an influencing urban relations and processes at a remove from the locale 
(Gaffney 2008).  Stadiums are embedded in spatial hierarchies that relate to the social 
production of  sporting practice at local, national and international levels.  As we will 
examine in more detail, when considering stadiums as instruments of  urban discipline, 
we must also consider sportive constellations and the historically situated cultural and 
urban process that relate to them.

Adding  to  the  current  literature  on  the  stadium  as  a  disciplinary  space 
(Gaffney and Mascarenhas 2004) mega-event projects in Rio de Janeiro are a measure 
of  shifting conceptions, patterns, and realities of  urban discipline.  After describing the 
historical trajectory and current realities of  mega-event production in Rio de Janeiro, 
in the conclusion I identify the particular ways in which disciplinary regimes associated 
with mega-events are imagined, legislated, constructed, and imposed in Rio de Janeiro.
Mega-events in Rio de Janeiro, 1919-1950
 
The first international sporting event in Rio de Janeiro was the 1919 South 
American  Football  Championships.    While  we  cannot  consider  a  five-team  soccer 
tournament to be a “mega event”, this was the first major international sporting event 
in the city.  Held in the Estádio das Laranjeiras of  the elite Fluminese Football Club, 
the Brazilian victory over Uruguay in the final game of  the tournament was the first 
in  a  long  series  of   moments  when  Brazilian  national  identity  crystallized  around  a 
stadium event.  It was also the first major instance of  the suspension of  urban normalcy 
for  a  sporting  event  in  the  city.    A  presidential  order  closed  banks  and  government 
for  the  day,  most  businesses  closed  early,  and  tens  of   thousands  filled  public  spaces 
to listen to live broadcasts of  the game.  In the stadium itself, approximately 25,000 
fans crowded into a stadium with a capacity of  18,000.  The Estádio das Laranjeiras 
emerged during an extended period of  urban restructuring wherein the urban landscape 
of  the colonial and early republican eras were reformed and re-imagined to conform 
to positivist, rationalized visions of  urban space.  Stadiums, as containers of  recently 
adopted  European  social  practices  in  Brazil,  functioned  as  both  sites  and  symbols 
of   modernity  carrying  explicit  messages  about  leisure,  bodily  discipline  and  social 
inclusion.    When  national  identity  crystallized  around  the  Brazilian  victory  in  1919, 
the space of  the stadium served to order conceptions of  the nation (Gaffney 2008). 
 
The South American Championship Football tournament returned to Rio de 
Janeiro  in  1922  as  part  of   the  Brazilian  Centennial  Exhibition.    The  capacity  of   the 
Laranjeiras stadium was increased, and in conjunction with the Centennial Expo buildings 
as a whole, the architecture of  the stadium was a self-conscious projection of  Brazilian 
modernity for national, continental and international audiences.  One of  the principal 
elements of  the Centennial Expo was to develop “satisfactory plans for the material and 
aesthetic transformation of  the City of  Rio de Janeiro with a special view to the probable 
necessities of  its development in the most distant future” (NY Times 1/28/1917).  It was 
also an opportunity to attract foreign capital to Brazil.  In this we see an early recognition 
of   the  capacity  of   mega-events  to  transform  public  interactions  and  spur  economic 
development through the reorganization of  urban space as the city government ordered 
the demolition of  Morro de Castelo (Castle Hill), which occupied a prominent position 
in the city center.  The rubble from the hill was used to create a large, flat area - today 
occupied by the Santos Dumont Airport.  Despite the attempts to control socio-space, 
the stadium was still relatively undisciplined as more than 35,000 people filled the 25,000 
capacity stands to see Brazil capture its second major international trophy.  
 
As  sport  became  an  increasingly  central  element  of   national  identity  in 
Brazil  during  the  1930s  and  1940s,  politicians  used  stadiums  throughout  Brazil  to 
promulgate national policies and consolidate power.  By using the popular associations 
of  sporting arenas, local and national officials were able to insert their political agendas 
into  assumedly  neutral  spaces  of   leisure.    Stadium  space  is  never  neutral,  but  carries 
important  political  and  social  messages  through  placement,  architecture,  and  usage 
norms.  When used in an explicitly political context, stadiums function as mechanisms 

          Mega-Events and Socio-Spatial Dynamics in Rio de Janeiro, 1919-2016 

13

through which politicians attempt to organize and control social relations.  In this sense, 
stadiums  function  as  an  instrumental  public  space  used  to  deliver  political  messages.  
Following the examples of  Mussolini and Hitler, Getúlo Vargas was one of  the first 
Brazilian  politicians  to  recognize  the  utility  of   stadiums  in  attaining  political  ends. 
 
If  we understand modernist urban planning and infrastructure development 
as  attempts  to  discipline  or  “fix”  urban  space  with  an  eye  to  accelerating  flows,  the 
construction of   the  Estádio  Municipal  do  Rio  de  Janeiro  between 1948-1950 can  be 
considered a watershed process in Rio’s urban history.  In 1947 soccer’s governing body 
(FIFA) selected Brazil to host the first post World War II World Cup.  A key element 
of  the agreement between FIFA and the Brazilian government was that a new stadium 
be constructed in Rio de Janeiro for the tournament.  By this time, soccer was wildly 
popular amongst all classes in Brazil and had emerged as one of  the central components 
of  Brazilian cultural identity, particularly in urban areas.  Brazilian soccer officials and 
politicians envisioned the 1950 World Cup as an opportunity for Brazil to perform on 
an international stage – not solely in sporting terms.  By hosting the World Cup – a 
tournament guaranteed through the financial commitment of  the state to build massive 
stadiums in Belo Horizonte and Rio de Janeiro – Brazil presented itself to the world 
as  capable  of   grand  engineering  feats,  ingenious  architecture,  and  productive  labor. 
 
In addition to projecting images of  progressive, industrialized modernity to 
the international community, Brazilian leaders imagined that the tournament would allow 
them to project a populist, progressive political agenda to local and national audiences.  
Rio’s  Mayor  Mendes  de  Morais  called  the  Estádio  Municipal  do  Rio  de  Janeiro  “a 
testament  to  the  productive  capability  of   Brazilians  and  a  signifying  monument  that 
will  be  a  badge  of   distinction  for  Cariocas,  allowing  the  city  to  be  compared  with 
the great cities of  the world.”  The president of  FIFA, Jules Rimet, commented that 
the  “stadium  should  be  compared  to  the  Colosseum  because  of   the  evocative  lines, 
the  majesty  of   the  concepts,  the  form  symbolizing  the  unity  of   all  nations  through 
sport.”  The press echoed these discursive sentiments about the role that the stadium 
would  play  in  the  consolidation  of   Brazilian  democracy,  the  function  of   sporting 
complexes to prepare strong, disciplined bodies for the defense of  the nation, and the 
elimination of  social difference through the “elliptical democracy” of  the giant concrete 
bowl.  This Estádio Municipal do Rio de Janeiro was the largest stadium in the world 
as  well  as  the  largest  stadium  project  since  the  Circus  Maximus  in  Imperial  Rome. 
 
Though  Brazil  failed  in  its  quest  to  win  the  1950  World  Cup,  the  publicly 
financed Estádio Municipal (later Estádio Mario Filho, aka Maracanã) eventually became 
one  of   the  principal  icons  of   Rio  de  Janeiro  and  Brazil.    The  stadium  symbolized 
Brazilian passion for sport and highlighted the role of  monumental architectural forms 
in communicating political and sporting ideologies.  The centerpieces of  this populist 
ideology  were  the  huge  capacity  of   the  stadium  (179,000,  approximating  one  tenth 
of   the  city’s  population  at  the  time  of   construction),  monumental  approach  ramps, 
undifferentiated seating in the stands (with the exception of  the palco de honor) and a 
section of  the stadium known as the geral.  The geral was a low-lying area of  concrete 
that  encircled  the  field.    This  “populist  heart”  of   the  stadium  was  a  functional  and 
symbolic space that allowed for the inclusion of  all social sectors in public life because 
of  the low ticket prices.  Before it was eliminated in 2005, a ticket for the geral was 
valued at three reales (US$1, at the time).  Though notoriously difficult to police and 
not particularly comfortable, the geral allowed all segments of  Rio society to participate 
in Brazil’s most popular form of  leisure in its most iconographic stadium (Figure 3).

games and will undergo yet another R$ 420 million in preparation for the 2014 World 
Cup. The main project for 2007 was to eliminate the geral, lower the playing field and 
insert seats in the lower bowl. The next round of  reforms will place luxury boxes just 
below the upper bowl and extend the roof  to cover all spectators. The plans also call for 
the construction of  a 10,000 garage where spectators will pass through a shopping mall 

before entering the stadium.

A new era of  globalization and sporting infrastructure
 
During the “golden years” of  Import Substitution Industrialization (ISI) and 
direct investment in public sporting facilities by local, state, and federal governments, 
the Brazilian sporting landscape grew to gigantic dimensions in the 1950s and 1960s.  
The conquest of  the World Cup in 1958 and 1962 consolidated Brazilian passion for 
and  identity  with  soccer.    By  1970,  when  the  military  government  was  actively  using 
the Brazilian national team to accomplish its domestic political agenda, Brazil had more 
stadiums with a capacity over 100,000 than any other country.  Part of  the political logic 
behind such large stadiums is that they diminished an individual’s ability to make their 
voice heard in public.  The cavernous space of  the stadium required participation en 
masse, reducing individual agency in the public sphere in a seemingly neutral political 
environment while at the same time diminishing the potential for oppositional politics. 
 
With  the  construction  of   Brasilia  in  1960,  Rio  began  a  long  period  of  
disinvestment  that  has  only  begun  to  abate  with  the  flourishing  of   the  Brazilian 
economy  in  the  first  decade  of   the  21st  century.    A  series  of   economic  crises  and 
high  rates  of   inflation,  combined  with  the  transition  (back)  to  democracy  in  1985 
led  to  an  aggravation  and  concentration  of   social  problems  in  urban  areas.    This 
was  particularly  true  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  which  suffered  from  the  suburbanization 
of  the middle class, the growth of  favelas, and the degradation of  the port and city 
center  (Lessa  2000:  345-348).    Underinvestment  in  public  infrastructure  and  massive 
public  debt  were  symptomatic  elements  of   the  “shocks”  imposed  through  the 
machinations  of   the  Washington  Consensus  (Klein  2005:  112-113,  133-135,  155). 
 
The  stadiums  of   the  modernist  era  were  reflections  of   a  populist 
Keynesianism,  providing  ample  theatres  for  the  production  and  consumption  of  
Brazil’s national pastime.  The Maracanã, finally completed more than a decade after 
the  World  Cup,  gradually  became  a  principal  icon  of   the  city  and  functioned  as  the 
biggest  stage  for  Brazil’s  national  sport.    Yet  it  too  suffered  from  neglect  in  an  era 
of   reduced  public  expenditure.    Even  as  they  deteriorated,  Brazil’s  gigantic  stadiums 
also continued to function as relatively open, affordable, and accessible public spaces. 
 
While the Brazilian sporting landscape remained stagnant, the global landscape 
of  sport changed dramatically through the 1980s and 1990s.  Beginning with the Los Angeles 
Summer Olympics in 1984, new forms of  financing, marketing, and communications 
technology combined to alter the form and function of  mega-events (Roche 2000: 159-
193).  These developments, part and parcel of  an emergent “post-modernism”, were 
mirrored by dramatic changes in the stadium landscapes of  the UK and USA. In the UK, 
stadiums came under the regulatory eye of  national government following a series of  
deadly accidents.  In the USA, stadiums became central elements of  urban redevelopment 
schemes (beginning with Baltimore’s Camden Yards).  In both instances, the shift from 
a participatory to a consumerist model of  fandom took precedence as stadium designers 
and  managers  targeted  more  affluent  groups  by  creating  ‘signature  stadiums’  with 
increased amenities and rigid internal spaces that re-enforced external socio-economic 
distinctions  (Gaffney  2008:  204-206).    National  and  international  sport  governing 
agencies were on the leading edge of  these changes and became increasingly influential in 
shaping the contemporary system of  international sport governance (Roche 2000:197). 
 
Despite  the  centrality  of   the  Maracanã  stadium  in  the  sporting  landscape 
of   Brazil  and  Rio  de  Janeiro,  the  shifting  political  economy  of   global  sport  in  the 
1990s  positioned  the  Maracanã  outside  the  realm  of   international  competitions.  
Following  USA  1994,  FIFA  and  the  IOC  began  to  require  that  all  stadiums  used 
for their events have a certain allotment of  VIP areas, a high proportion of  parking 

16                                      Journal of  Latin American Geography                                                                    

spaces  relative  to  overall  capacity,  standardized  media  areas  and  individual,  ticketed 
seats for spectators. Brazilian stadiums did not conform to any of  these requirements. 
 
Between  1950  and  1998,  the  Maracanã  did  not  undergo  any  significant 
architectural  modifications  and  frequently  attracted  crowds  in  excess  of   100,000 
people.    However,  when  the  Maracanã  hosted  international  soccer  games,  the  geral 
had  to  be  closed  because  the  space  was  “undisciplined”,  that  is,  it  did  not  function 
in  accordance  with  international  rules  that  required  every  spectator  be  allotted  a 
specific  place  within  the  stadium.    The  deteriorating  condition  of   the  stadium  (and 
the  hostility  of   the  fans)  was  so  severe  that  the  Brazilian  national  team  did  not  play 
there between 2000 and 2007.  Adding to the problem were a series of  embezzlement 
scandals,  chaotic  ticketing  mechanisms,  a  lack  of   police  control  of   urban  space 
surrounding  the  stadium,  and  a  general  opacity  in  the  management  and  organization 
of   the  stadium  complex  and  Brazilian  soccer  in  general  (Gaffney  2008:  103-116). 
 
Beginning in 1998 and continuing today, the Maracanã has undergone a series 
of  major reforms in order to bring it into compliance with international regulations.  These 
reforms included putting plastic seats throughout the upper bowl of  the stadium, which 
reduced the stadium’s capacity from 179,000 to 129,000.  Secondary reforms included the 
introduction of  luxury boxes along the upper rim of  the stadium, which had the effect 
of  decreasing air circulation and exacerbating the already prodigious heat generated by 
the giant concrete bowl.  These modifications also reflected a change towards a Euro-
American style of  spectatorship whereby elites are able to distance themselves from the 
crowd.  The third major reform (2005-2006) was to eliminate the geral, replacing the open 
concrete area with individual seats.  This reform necessitated the closing of  the stadium 
for  nine  months  in  2005  and  reduced  the  overall  capacity  of   the  stadium  to  89,000. 
 
If  the undifferentiated space of  the geral represented an era in Brazil’s history 
when infrastructure development projects undertaken in the context of  global mega-
events were intended to communicate ideas of  democracy and industrial modernity, the 
continuance of  those forms into a new era of  globalization and neo-liberal governance 
rendered obsolete the internal architecture of  the stadium.  The geral was a space that 
did  not  concord  with  a  shifting  political  economy  of   sport,  or  the  shifting  demands 
of   spectators.    In  conversations  with  directors  of   the  state  agency  responsible  for 
the  oversight  of   Rio’s  public  stadiums,  it  became  clear  that  reforming  these  spaces 
in  the  context  of   anticipated  mega-events  was  an  attempt  to  attract  a  new  cycle  of  
infrastructure development for the city at large.  These developments were no longer cast 
in the populist light of  the 1950s, but were aimed at attracting international tourists and, 
in a local context, targeted a different kind of  consumer.  The elimination of  the geral 
not only erased “popular” space within the stadium, it diminished the overall capacity 
and replaced general seating with hard backed seats that could only be accessed with a 
specific ticket.  These tickets are not as affordable for the general public, having increased 
from 3 reales to 20.  More directly, the installation of  closed-circuit cameras in the streets 
surrounding the stadium as well as in the stadium itself revealed a desire to impose a new 
kind of  social order in public space. This order reflects the targeting of  public monies for 
private consumption practices.  This is consistent with other developments in the city at 
large wherein the city is no longer a place to live and work, but as a thing to be marketed 
and sold.  This “luxury market is intended for a group of  elite consumers: international 
capitol, visitors and users with disposable income” (Vainer 2000: 83).  The reformation 
and construction of  sporting landscapes is an integral part of  this conception of  the city. 
 
Between 1950 and 2007, Rio de Janeiro did not host any major international 
sporting events despite applying for the 2002 and 2008 Olympic Games.  As Rio de Janeiro 
began its preparations for the 2007 Pan American Games, large signs sprung up in various

infrastructure  modernization 

parts of  the city declaring “No Rio, esporte quer dizer futuro” – In Rio, sport is the future.  
This is reflective of  a long-standing discourse surrounding sport and social development 
in  Brazil.    The  discourse  suggests  that  by  investing  heavily  in  sporting  infrastructure 
and social programs aimed at the development of  athletes, Rio will be able to extricate 
itself from chronic problems of  socio-economic polarization and drug-related violence.  
Indeed, one of  the reasons that Brazil has been so successful in the international soccer 
is that sport is one of  the only viable escape mechanisms for impoverished youth from 
cycles  of   violence  and  socio-economic  marginalization.    Millions  of   Brazilians  begin 
laboring towards the goal of  becoming a professional athlete in pre-adolescence.  While 
more than 6,000 Brazilians are currently playing professional soccer in foreign leagues, the 
vast majority of  aspiring soccer players will never make a living through sport.  The heavy 
investiture in sporting infrastructure channels money from the development of  social and 
educational programs perpetuating cycles of  poverty and disassociation that contribute 
to  the  chronic  problems  of   violence,  drugs,  and  marginalization  in  Rio  de  Janeiro.  
 
After  winning  the  bid  for  the  2007  Pan  American  Games  in  2002,  Rio  de 
Janeiro’s state and city governments combined with the Brazilian national government 
to  spend  more  than  5  billion  reales  on  stadium  construction  and  renovation, 
transportation,  and  communications 
(Mascarenhas 
2006).    These  were  the  costliest  Pan  American  Games  ever.    This  vast  expenditure 
did not include a US$ 300 million outlay for increased security.  The cornerstone of  
the  security  measures  was  the  provision  of   18,000  extra  police  and  the  installation 
of   1,700  security  cameras  around  the  city  to  ensure  the  smooth  functioning  of  
events.    In  a  city  marked  by  extreme  violence,  this  disciplinary  measure,  coupled 
with  the  internal  “discipline”  of   reformed  stadium  architecture  was  intended  to 
showcase  the  ability  of   Rio  de  Janeiro  to  host  mega-events  to  the  IOC  and  FIFA. 
 
For  the  Pan  American  Games  new  sporting  venues  were  built  in  three 
“Olympic  Zones”  throughout  the  city,  the  vast  majority  of   installations,  including 
the “Villa Pan” (Olympic housing) located on greenfield sites in Barra de Tijuca, far 
from the centers of  population in the north of  the city.  Central to the Rio Organizing 
Committee’s  bid  were  plans  to  build  a  new  subway  line  and  improve  the  deplorable 
pollution  in  Guanabara  Bay.    These  projects  were  quickly  scrapped  as  the  stadium 
projects ran more than five times over budget (NY Times, May 22, 2007).  While there 
were no major incidences of  during the tournament (battles between police and drug 
lords preceded the opening of  the games with multiple fatalities, Figure 4), the post-
tournament  landscape  of   violence  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  has  not  changed  significantly. 
 
low-
paying  service  sector  employment,  the  sportive  constellation  developed  for  the 
Pan  2007  directed  public  money  to  the  production  of   Olympic  space  that  has  left 
little  behind  in  the  way  of   social  programs  or  functional  urban  spaces.    Indeed,  the 
unequal  geographic  and  social  distribution  of   public  monies  has  arguably  left  many 
communities  worse  off   than  before.    Added  to  this  were  plans  to  privatize  public 
spaces  such  as  Aterro  de  Flamengo  and  Marina  da  Gloria.    Residents’  associations 
stopped  these  plans,  but  not  until  millions  of   reales  of   public  money  were  spent.
 
The  Villa  Pan,  constructed  with  money  drawn  from  the  Federal  Workers 
Fund,  was  constructed  on  unstable  sub-soil  and  ran  many  times  over  budget.  
The  majority  of   the  apartments  sold  on  the  first  day  they  were  available,  but  the 
residents  who  moved  in  found  that  they  were  incomplete.    In  October  of   2009, 
the  Brazilian  federal  government  indicted  the  engineering  and  construction  firms 
contracted to build the Villa Pan for grossly inflated wage bills, deliberate contractual

malfeasance,  and  undelivered  services.  The  head  of   construction  projects  for  the 
Pan  American  Games  was  ordered  to  repay  RS28  million  to  the  Federal  coffers.

Figure  4.  Reproduction  of   a  t-shirt  made  for  the  2007  Pan  American  Games.
In the lead-up to the Games, the Rio police killed at least 19 people in the Complexo de 
Alemão in an attempt to control drug traffic. The city, state, and federal governments 
also  increased  the  military  presence  in  Rio  for  the  duration  of   the  games,  ensuring 
by  force  of   arms  that  the  Games  would  be  carried  off   without  violent  protest. 
 
The  global  trend  in  mega-event  production  suggests  that  these  projects 
leave  communities  with  massive  debt,  a  reduction  in  public  space,  and  public 
financing  for  real  estate  development  projects  (Mascarenhas  2006,  Gold  and 
Gold  2007).    This  was  also  the  experience  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  where  as  of   October 
2009,  only  one  of   the  installations  built  for  the  2007  Pan  American  Games 
is  open  for  public  use,  the  remainder  have  been  privatized  (Figures  5,  6,  7). 
 
The 2007 Pan American Games left an ambiguous social and urban legacy.  The 
production of  Olympic constellations in Rio did not deliver the promised transportation 
infrastructure, did not improve the housing situation for Rio’s poor, did not open new 
sporting venues in order to develop the a generation of  Olympic athletes, and neglected 
promises of  environmental remediation while contributing to the generalized opacity of  
mega-events.  Tens of  thousands of  police prevented public violence in the city for a 
short period of  time before conditions returned to “normal”.  On the other hand, the

Pan 2007 did provide residents with the opportunity to see high-level sport in a variety of  
disciplines that have little or no presence in Brazil.  It also provided the Brazilian Olympic 
Committee with valuable experience so that they could pursue the 2016 Summer Olympics.

Figure  5.  Stadium  Rio.  Originally  called  Estádio  Olímpico  João  Havelange,  the 
stadium  has  been  subject  to  much  criticism  for  its  high  cost  (R$380  million) 
and  the  lack  of   access.  In  this  photo  the  one-way  traffic  passes  the  Engenho 
do  Dentro  rail  station.  The  stadium  is  clearly  a  monumental  project  located  in  a 
lower-middle  class  neighborhood  without  tall  buildings.  Botafogo  Football  Club 
rents  the  stadium  for  R$30,000  per  month.  It  is  completely  closed  to  the  public.

Figure 6. HSBC Arena. Originally known as Arena Olímpica, the building has not hosted a 
sporting event since the 2007 Pan American Games. Its primary function is to host music 
shows. There is no way for the public to enter the stadium without paying for an event.

Figure  7.  Centro  Aquático  Maria  Lenk.  This  was  the  main  center  for  the  swimming 
competitions for the 2007 Pan American Games but has not hosted a swimming event since 
then. The arena will have to undergo major reforms in order to meet IOC requirements 
for the 2016 Olympics. Additionally, the pool does not meet Olympic standards so another 
swimming center will have to be constructed for 2016. This facility is closed to public use.

The future is now: World Cup 2014 and 2016 Summer Olympics
 
Shortly after the “successful” hosting of  Pan 2007, FIFA awarded Brazil the 
2014 World Cup.  The Brazilian organizing committee quickly suggested that the Maracanã 
host the final game of  the tournament and that Rio serve as the media and communications 
center for the month long event.  The centerpiece of  Rio’s project is a massive reform 
of  the Maracanã complex, including the development of  a 10,000 car parking garage, a 
shopping mall connected to an inter-modal transport station, and major reforms to the 
Maracanã stadium which include extending the roof  in order to cover all of  the stadium’s 
seats (SUDERJ 2008).  This $430 million project, aimed at attracting international tourists, 
corporate executives, and wealthy Brazilians to the stadium are happening a goal-kick away 
from the Mangueira favela.  The favela complex has been left out of  the development 
project for the World Cup, placing what will become an international tourist destination in 
painful proximity to a residential area without basic infrastructure.  This is comparable to 
Meade’s observations of  Rio de Janeiro in the early 20th century “in which the sprawling 
neighborhoods of  the urban poor as well as the informal economy those neighborhoods 
generated, existed in close relationship with the formal economy, the state and its culture 
but  only  experienced  that  formal  sector  as  brutal  and  abusive”  (Meade  1997:  182).
 
Contrary to the democratic ideologies that were at the forefront of  the 1950 
World Cup, the discourses surrounding the 2014 World Cup reflect the exigencies of  
an increasingly globalized and neo-liberal political economy.  The Brazilian minister of  
sport Orlando Silva suggested that, “the World Cup will leave us among other things 
more  attractive  stadiums.  Clubs  will  be  able  to  demand  higher  ticket  prices,  and  our 
football will be able to finance itself better.”  This is similar to North American models 
of   stadium  development  that  take  public  monies  and  funnel  the  profits  into  private 
hands.  The erstwhile populist president of  Brazil was on the same page as his sports 
minister,  saying  that  state  financing  of   infrastructure  for  the  World  Cup,  “is  more 

          Mega-Events and Socio-Spatial Dynamics in Rio de Janeiro, 1919-2016 

21

than a promise made by the current government, it is a promise made by the state, to 
show the world that Brasil is a growing country with an organized, stable economy”.  
Not to be left out of  the neo-liberal parade was the head of  Brazil’s soccer federation 
Ricardo  Teixiera  (also  the  son-in-law  of   former  IOC  president  João  Havelange), 
who  suggested  that  the  tournament  would  cut  costs  by  using  “20,000  volunteers, 
giving  the  poorest  children  of   our  cities  the  first  chance  to  be  selected  to  represent 
Brazil to the world” (OGlobo.com July 21, 2007).  A similar program was attempted 
for the 2007 Pan American Games, but when the volunteers gathered in a stadium for 
orientation fights broke out between rival drug factions and the plan was abandoned. 
 
In  order  to  finance  the  Maracanã  project,  the  state  agency  responsible  for 
stadium  development  and  management  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  (SUDERJ),  put  forward 
a plan to privatize the Maracanã, placing it in the hands of  Rio’s four biggest soccer 
clubs.    Currently,  SUDERJ  leases  the  stadium  to  the  clubs  for  games.    Under  the 
privatization  plan,  luxury  box  rights  would  be  leased  to  individuals  and  companies, 
and  the  teams  would  no  longer  rent  the  stadium  but  would  be  part  owners  in  the 
stadium receiving the funds from gate receipts.  Again, this follows North American 
models  of   stadium  development  whereby  public  monies  are  used  to  funnel  profits 
into  private  hands.    It  is  also  consistent  with  neo-liberal  models  of   selling  public 
goods  to  private  companies  that  have  repeatedly  caused  grief   in  Latin  America..
 
In May of  2009, the Brazilian World Cup Organizing Committee announced 
the  twelve  cities  that  will  host  the  2014  World  Cup.    The  projected  cost  of   stadium 
construction alone is in excess of  R$4.35 billion.  This is equivalent to R$ 6,100 per 
stadium  seat  (Table  1).    Between  2007  and  2009,  the  2014  Organizing  Committee 
conducted a competition among 18 cities, engendering a bidding war full of  political 
intrigue  in  which  host  cities  and  states  scrambled  to  outspend  their  competition  on 
new  stadiums,  highways,  and  airport  terminals.    Incredibly,  Brazil  does  not  currently 
have  any  stadiums  that  meet  FIFA  requirements  for  hosting  a  World  Cup  game.  
Given that the Pan 2007 was a fairly localized event and ran more than ten times over 
budget, we can safely assume that the cost for stadium infrastructure and the forced 
modernization  of   Brazil’s  notoriously  bad  air,  highway,  and  rail  systems  will  cost 
many  billions  more.    While  many  of   these  infrastructure  development  projects  will 
come  under  the  aegis  of   the  federal  Program  for  Accelerated  Development  (PAC), 
others  like  the  proposed  high  speed  train  linking  Rio  and  São  Paulo  will  be  public-
private  partnerships.    One  such  partnership  is  envisioned  for  the  Maracanã  which 
will be managed and operated by a private firm for 35 years following the World Cup. 
2016 Summer Olympics
 
On October 2, 2009 the International Olympic Committee selected Rio de 
Janeiro as the host of  the 2016 Summer Olympics.  This was the third time that Rio de 
Janeiro has bid for the Summer Olympics – the collective cost of  the two most recent 
bids, not the games themselves, is approximately US$100 million.  The bid for the 2016 
Games is detailed and complex, encapsulating a phenomenal range of  development goals.  
The utilization of  sporting discourses and the role of  the Olympics as a mechanism for 
socio-spatial transformation is evident when we look at the areas of  focus in the Rio bid:
 
 
 
 
 

•   Olympic values underpinning education and social development
•   Olympic Games a major driver for Rio’s ongoing development
•   New territory for the Olympic Games
•   Promotion of  Brazil
•   Enhancement of  the Olympic brand through Games experience

•   Long-term city plans and requirements will be accelerated
•   Create a deeper, global understanding of  modern Brazil
•   Create sports legacy benefits for all of South America

          Mega-Events and Socio-Spatial Dynamics in Rio de Janeiro, 1919-2016 

23

These points highlight the role that government officials intend for the Olympics to play 
in accelerating infrastructure modernization projects in Rio de Janeiro.  Cryptic phrases 
such as promotion of  Brazil and create a deeper, global understanding of  modern Brazil 
are code for marketing the city and nation to highly mobile global capital.  The notion 
of  developmental acceleration is at the forefront of  the bid, but the forms of  the plans 
and  requirements  are  deliberately  vague.    As  with  most  mega-events,  development  is 
highly uneven and tends to benefit private developers and construction interests while 
creating spaces of  leisure for wealthy residents and the international tourist class.  The 
increased security apparatuses that have become defining features of  global-mega events 
effectively  privatize  public  spaces  in  the  city,  installing  surveillance  mechanisms  that 
continue operating long after the Games are over. 
 
drive the socio-spatial transformation of  host cities (Figure 8).  

As we have seen, the discursive structures of  sport and Olympism in particular, 

Figure 8. Host cities for the 2016 Olympic Games

24                                      Journal of  Latin American Geography                                                                    

In the context of Rio de Janeiro’s bid the:
 
Inclusion of  Olympic Values as a base for education and social development. 
Sport has an incontestable power as a transformative tool through social inclusion and 
education. As a nation in a phase of  rapid development, Brazil has much to gain with 
educational programs and the  engagement of  youth in the Olympic Movement.
But the Olympics are not only intended to reform social relations.  The inclusion of  
“sustainability” as a pillar of  the Olympic Movement following the 1988 Seoul Olympics 
has encouraged every subsequent host city to wrap its monumental building projects 
in  a  veil  of   environmental  munificence  –  even  though  the  carbon  footprint  of   the 
Olympic games merely in terms of  airline flights to the host city is staggering.  For the 
Rio Organizing Committee, the Olympic Games:

…represent an important transformative force, permitting the renovation of  
fragile natural areas  as  well  as  the  improved  functioning  of   transportation 
systems.  The  impact  for  Rio  will  be  unparalleled,  offering  an  opportunity 
for the renovation of  the port area and surroundings, the improvement of  
points of  inter-modal public transport, and the acceleration of  high priority 
environmental programs with the larger objective of  developing a sustainable 
city.
Ironically, the majority of  the facilities built for the Pan 2007 were constructed 
 
on wetlands in Barra de Tijuna.  The majority of  the housing and sporting infrastructures 
were built on concrete pylons that had to be sunk 45 meters into the subsoil.  Additionally, 
the highway and subway projects envisioned for the Olympics will pass through existing 
neighborhoods  and  under  park  space,  lessening  water  quality  and  disturbing  natural 
habitat.  The majority of  Rio’s Olympic installations will be built on the wetlands of  
Barra de Tijuca. 
 
In addition to transforming socio-spatial relationships in Rio de Janeiro, the 
Olympic bid envisions the Games as an opportunity for Brazil to project its industry and 
economy on an international stage: 
 

….the world’s 7th largest economy with a diverse industrial base, Brazil stands 
out as having a series of  innovations.  Recent incentives in the environmental 
arena have elevated the country as a global leader in certain industrial segments 
such as bio-fuel, agri-business and recycling.  The Olympic Games present an 
ideal platform to expose this progress in global terms.
 
Thus, the Olympics become a mechanism for transforming the space of  the 
 
city  while  at  the  same  time  acting  as  a  platform  to  project  those  transformations  to 
the international community.  The public investiture in mega-events is intended, on one 
hand, to provide world class facilities that cater to an international tourist class.  On 
the other hand, it is a mechanism for accelerated infrastructural development wrapped 
in  the  politically  neutral  and  universalistic  discourses  of   sport.    The  transformations 
that mega-events wreak are permanent, impose temporary forms of  governance that 
elide  democratic  institutions,  install  new  and  enduring  surveillance  and  disciplinary 
mechanisms, while both creating and exacerbating unequal geographies of  power within 
the city at large.  This process will most likely mirror the urban reforms undertaken at 
the beginning of  the 20th Century which “…never resolved the issue of  social control 
entirely;  instead,  they  merely  introduced  a  new  set  of   antagonisms  and  changed  the 
contours of  the struggle between those who were benefiting from the new Rio and those 
who were not” (Meade 1997: 122) 

          Mega-Events and Socio-Spatial Dynamics in Rio de Janeiro, 1919-2016

In essence, the hosting of  a global mega-event “opens new opportunities for 
the  accumulation  of   capital,  principally  in  the  real  estate  sector  installing  a  despotic 
politics  that  ignores  socio-spatial  difference  in  the  urban  fabric  in  favor  of   a  neo-
liberal  plan”  (Pasini  and  Pontes  2006).    This  plan  will  be  carried  out  by  the  APO 
(Public  Olympic  Authority).    The  APO  will  have  power  to  direct  the  R$30  billion 
budget,  acquire  land  through  eminent  domain,  and  will  be  the  central  coordinating 
authority for all Games projects, including security.  The APO is an extra-governmental 
institution  with  appointed  leadership  that  will  have  immense  powers  the  shape  the 
city for the next ten years.  No one is quite sure just how much power the APO will 
have, but within a week of  its creation, members of  the city and state governments 
were reassuring the public that its powers would be limited.  The likely candidate to 
head  the  APO,  Ricardo  Leyser  Gonçalves,  was  recently  indicted  by  the  Tribunal  de 
Contas do Nação (TCU) for his “irregular” use of  public money during the Pan 2007. 
 
This  is  not  to  say  that  urgent  changes  to  Brazil’s  urban  infrastructures 
are not necessary or that the effects of  mega-events are wholly negative.  However, 
it is unclear whether or not Rio’s mega-event projects are consistent with long-term 
city  development  plans.    The  tremendous  economic  stress  of   hosting  mega-events 
requires  that  “most  investments  be  covered  by  public  or  private  entities”  (Pruess 
2004:  284).    There  is  not  much  evidence  to  suggest  that  the  projects  imagined  for 
the  2014  World  Cup  or  2016  Olympics  are  targeting  the  chronic  problems  of   Rio 
de  Janeiro.    To  make  matters  worse,  “in  developing  countries,  the  economic  impact 
created  by  the  Games  is  smaller  than  in  industrialized  countries…if   the  Games 
neither  support  an  urgently  needed  city  development  not  the  economic  impact  to 
be  expected  then  only  a  positive  image  and  promotion  effect  might  occur”  (Pruess 
2004:  285).    As  Rio  de  Janeiro  moves  forward  with  its  plans  to  invest  billions  in 
mega-events,  it  will  be  critically important to  have an  open,  democratic involvement 
in  the  process  so  that  the  most  pressing  needs  of   its  citizens  can  be  addressed.
 
Conclusions 
 
By observing the shifting discourses associated with the development sporting 
landscapes  we  gain  unique  insight  into  larger  urban,  social,  political  and  economic 
realms.  This insight is unique and shocking because of  the supposed political neutrality 
of  sport, especially in the context of  the Olympics where discourses of  amateurism and 
a “level playing field” still figure heavily in public consciousness.  In early 20th century 
Brazil, sport was primarily an elite practice.  As sporting practices filtered through the 
socio-economic spectrum they were imbued with moralizing discourses associated with 
civilizing mechanisms.  Similar to the ways in which scientific urban planning intended 
to  sanitize,  civilize,  and  project  a  cosmopolitan  city  image  to  locals  and  tourists,  the 
landscape  of   sport  was  also  a  place  and  space  that  carried  certain  notions  of   social 
discipline  (Meade  1997;  Gaffney  and  Mascarenhas  2005).    Similarly,  the  2007  Pan 
American Games, the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympic Games and their associated 
social-sport infrastructures have as their goal the appropriation of  public money for 
the reformation of  the city along neo-liberal modes of  urban and social development.  
This  is  consistent  with  the  trajectory  of   the  city  at  large  (Arantes,  Vainer,  Maricato 
2000; Lessa 2000).  The discourses of  sport place those who raise oppositional voices 
to  mega-events  into  categories  of   “anti-patriotic”,  “anti-progressive”  and  “radical”. 
 
As Roche (2000:7) suggests, developing critical perspectives on mega-events 
provides  insight  into  structure,  change,  and  agency  in  contemporary  society.    The 
temporal and spatial aspects of  mega-events provide encapsulated images of  cities and 

26                                      Journal of  Latin American Geography                                                                    

cultures that are intended to be internalized and consumed by locals, tourists, and a host 
of  political and financial interests.  Cities and countries competitively bid for an event 
in the hopes of  ‘remaking’ their cities by creating new transportation, communication, 
transport, tourist, and sporting infrastructure, increasing tourism, providing temporary 
jobs, and marketing the city or country to attract global capital.  These projects, massive 
in their scope and scale, cost many billions of  public dollars and leave behind ambiguous 
legacies.  Nearly every global mega-event has resulted in financial losses for the host, 
temporary cessation of  democratic process, the production of  militarized and exclusionary 
spaces, residential displacement, and environmental degradation (Leyinski 2008).  Global 
mega-events such as the Summer Olympics, the FIFA World Cup and regional mega-
events such as the Pan-American, Asian, and Commonwealth Games are in continual 
states of  development, always reflecting the intersection between the local and the global.
 
Mega-events  function  to  discipline  urban  space  and  social  relations  in 
distinct ways.  In the first instance, mega-events fix space in order to accelerate capital 
accumulation.  This goal is accomplished through the funneling of  public money towards 
tourist, leisure, communications, and transportation projects.  Second, the institutional 
governing structures of  international sporting bodies such as the IOC and FIFA require 
that  cities  fund  their  sportive  constellations,  effectively  taking  public  money  cities 
funneling it to private business interests.  In the case of  the Olympics, the Brazilian federal 
government was required to issue a blank check, guaranteeing any cost over runs. This 
paves the way, literally and figuratively, for corruption and graft – problems that resulted 
in a budgetary overrun of  ten times the projected cost for the 2007 Pan American Games. 
 
Third,  the  disciplinary  institutions,  discourses,  and  mechanisms  of   sport 
and  stadiums  are  extended  to  the  whole  of   the  city.    The  need  to  create  docile, 
disciplined  bodies  inside  stadia  is  reflected  in  the  need  to  have  docile  bodies  in 
public  space.    This  is  actuated not  only  in  the  increase  of   police  forces  and  security 
cameras  but  through  the  implementation  of   social  programs  based  in  sport,  not 
education  or  public  works.    These  programs  serve  to  produce  bodies  that  can  then 
be  incorporated  into  professional  systems  of   sport  within  which  teams  make  huge 
profits  by  selling  individuals  on  the  global  market  –the  equivalent  of   providing  a 
subsidy  to  professional  teams  to  manufacture  their  future  employees  and  profits.
 
Fourth, the social programs associated with the various games are intended to 
instill codes of  ethics and behavioral norms that are in accordance with the “Olympic 
Spirit” but really serve the dominant paradigms of  international sport and a neo-liberal 
political  economy.    Positioned  as  elements  of   education,  the  stated  goals  of   these 
programs  suggest  that  “it  is  through  sport  that  young  people  and  children  learn  to 
overcome obstacles, respect rules, work within a team and demonstrate solidarity. Values 
that come from the field of  play help to encounter difficulties and provide strength to 
fight for a better life” (Rio de Janeiro Organizing Committee).  Yet these programs aimed 
at developing disciplined minds and bodies are wrapped in a global political economy of  
sports that serves, in part, to exacerbate instead of  ameliorate social and spatial inequalities. 
 
The  development  of   spatial  constellations  that  accompany  mega-events 
function to accelerate flows.  By funneling public monies into the production of  sportive 
constellations, cities are compelled to produce spaces that do not necessarily function 
outside of  the context of  the event.  Typically, once the event has passed, cities are left 
with massive building projects that they are required to pour money into through debt 
servicing and maintenance.  In some cases, the cost overruns are passed on to ordinary or 
habitual consumers who are forced to spend an increasing share of  their wealth to attend 
events in the stadium.  This has the further effect of  locking out lower income residents 
from the very places that they have been taxed to create.  Furthermore, the privileging of  

          Mega-Events and Socio-Spatial Dynamics in Rio de Janeiro, 1919-2016 

27

private transportation and inclusion of  a higher percentage of  luxury boxes and seating 
only sections, shifts the culture of  the crowd to one that is more orientated to consumption 
of  rather than participation in the event.  In short, the cycles of  mega-event production 
and consumption are dictated by international sporting organizations and multi-national 
corporations who combine with the state to exploit the emotions associated with sport 
to take public monies in order to create a docile, disciplined, consumerist society.  This is 
hugely problematic in Brazil, and in Rio de Janeiro in particular, where socio-economic 
status  (and  therefore  the  ability  to  consume)  is  closely  linked  to  racial  categories.  
 
When considered as part of  a larger historical trajectory, we see that there has 
been a discernable shift in the logics of  stadium production in Brazil from large, inclusive 
stadiums that functioned largely in the public realm to smaller, exclusive stadiums that 
cater to a much more limited segment of  the population.  Much as the passage of  public 
health and sanitation bills in the late 19th century were intended to “civilize” the city, Rio’s 
current infrastructure development projects may be attempts “to allow foreign capitalized 
firms a direct say in the way Rio de Janeiro was to allocate its space” (Meade 1997: 79).
 
Finally and by way of  suggestion, the processes by which Olympic cities are 
transformed  are  eerily  similar  to  the  “shock  doctrines”  that  inform  public  policy  in 
the wake of  political, environmental, or economic disasters (Klein 2007).  One of  the 
elements that Klein identifies as central to the transformation of  national political and 
economic structures is the imposition of  temporary, extra-legal forms of  governance 
that  disappear  once  the  moment  of   crisis  has  passed.    An  example  of   this  was  the 
Coalition Provisional Authority in post-invasion Iraq, that “melted away” after “handing 
out its billions to contractors” (Klein 2007: 453).  Similarly, the Organizing Committees 
that  are  responsible  for  funding  and  managing  mega-event  budgets  are  autonomous 
entities comprised of  national elites not subject to any sort of  democratic accountability.  
Organizing committees have access to tens of  billions of  dollars of  public money, keep 
their own books, and award contracts for everything from stadium building to concessions, 
claiming land through eminent domain to contracting private and public security forces.  
After  the  mega-event  has  passed,  the  committee  dissolves,  leaving  behind  political, 
economic,  and  socio-spatial  legacies  that  promote  neo-liberal  forms  of   governance.  
There is no legal recourse for those displaced or otherwise aggrieved by the mega-event 
– the massive debt is assumed by the city and with time the corruption scandals fade. 
 
The main differences between the selling of  public utilities and the hollowing 
out of  state services that Klein identifies as integral components of  shock doctrines and 
the staging of  mega-events is that in the latter, the shock is not perceived as trauma but 
as a highly securitized festival and spectacle.  The mega-event is invariably wrapped in 
nationalist discourses and urban boosterism, transforming the raiding of  public coffers to 
stimulate private profit into a civic obligation.  It is all the more insidious for this.  Mega-
events impose mechanisms of  militarization, privatization, “free-trade”, global branding, 
the hollowing out of  state services, and the public subsidy of  infrastructures that conform 
to the exigencies of  increasingly mobile forces of  global capital that are exactly the same 
as those imposed by authoritarian neo-liberal regimes.  The mega-event city is shocked by 
years of  construction projects, debt accumulation, the restructuring of  the everyday, media 
campaigns, the arrival of  hundreds of  thousands of  wealthy tourists, and the militarization 
of  urban space.  These shocks reverberate through time and space while the instruments 
of  their implementation dissolve into memory.  Following Roche (2000:199), if  “we can 
understand mega-events as social spatio-temporal ‘hubs’ and ‘switches’ that both channel, 
mix, and re-route global flows, as well as being periodically ‘over-flowed’ by them,” then 
it follows that the socio-spatial structures that mega-events impose are active expressions 
of  the strictures and structures of  an increasingly global neo-liberal political economy.

The  creation  of   the  neo-liberal  Olympic  city  is  in  effect  the  construction 
of  what Davis and Monk (2007: xvi) refer to as an “Evil Paradise” where “Olympic 
mega-structures…arise  from  the  toil  of   migrant  workers  whose  own  homes  are 
fetid  barracks  and  desolate  encampments.”    Rio  de  Janeiro  has  fully  engaged  the 
process  of   making  itself  into  an  Olympic  City  where  the  workers  will  stream 
down  from  the  favelas  to  build  sportive  constellations  that  are  intended  for 
use  by  the  international  tourist  class  and  the  upper  strata  of   Brazilian  society.
