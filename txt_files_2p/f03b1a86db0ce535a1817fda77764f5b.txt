Vacuolar-type ATPase (V-ATPase) purified from the
midgut of the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta is in-
hibited 50% by 10 nM of the plecomacrolide concanamy-
cin A, the specific inhibitor of V-ATPases. To determine
the binding site(s) of that antibiotic in the enzyme com-
plex, labeling with the semisynthetic 9-O-[p-(trifluoro-
ethyldiazirinyl)-benzoyl]-21,23-dideoxy-23-[125I]iodo-
concanolide A (J-concanolide A) was performed, which
still inhibits the V-ATPase 50% at a concentration of
15–20 ␮M. Upon treatment with UV light, a highly reac-
tive carbene is generated from this concanamycin deriv-
ative, resulting in the formation of a covalent bond to
the enzyme. In addition, the radioactive tracer 125I
makes the detection of the labeled subunit(s) feasible.
Treatment of the V1/Vo holoenzyme, the Vo complex, and
the V-ATPase containing goblet cell apical membranes
with concanolide resulted in the labeling of only the
proteolipid, subunit c, of the proton translocating Vo
complex. Binding of J-concanolide A to subunit c was
prevented in a concentration-dependent manner by con-
canamycin A, indicating that labeling was specific.
Binding was also prevented by the plecomacrolides
bafilomycin A1 and B1, respectively, but not by the ben-
zolactone enamide salicylihalamide, a member of a
novel class of V-ATPase inhibitors.

Vacuolar-type ATPases (V-ATPases)1 are complex, hetero-
multimeric proteins consisting of a peripheral, catalytic V1
complex and a membrane bound, ion translocating Vo complex.

V-ATPases in eukaryotes appear to be exclusive proton pumps
that energize intracellular membranes of all cells as well as
plasma membranes in a variety of animal cells (1). V-ATPases
play crucial roles for many cellular processes and may also be
involved in diseases such as osteoporosis and cancer (2).

More than a decade ago, bafilomycin A1, a plecomacrolide
antibiotic containing a 16-membered lactone ring, was reported
to be a specific inhibitor of V-ATPases with a Ki value of less
than 10 nM (3). A structure-activity study showed that the
concanamycins, 18-membered plecomacrolides, exhibit 10-fold
lower Ki values and thus are better and more specific inhibitors
of V-ATPases than the bafilomycins (4). Kinetic studies of the
bovine chromaffin granule V-ATPase provided the first indirect
evidence that bafilomycin A1 interacts with the hydrophobic Vo
complex (5). Direct evidence came from two independent ap-
proaches, both using the bovine-coated vesicle V-ATPase (6, 7).
First, a latent acid-activated proton conductance of proteolipo-
somes containing the reconstituted Vo complex could be blocked
by 1 nM bafilomycin A1 (6). Second, reconstituted vesicles con-
taining the Vo complex added to clathrin-coated vesicles could
protect ATP-dependent proton transport from bafilomycin in-
hibition (7). Since considerable protection was also achieved by
the reconstituted 100-kDa subunit a alone, it was concluded
that the binding site for bafilomycin may reside in this subunit.
Affinity chromatography of chicken osteoclast V-ATPase us-
ing bafilomycin C1-coupled cellulose led to the purification of
the holoenzyme (8). In the presence of 1 mM DCCD the
V-ATPase did not bind to the column, indicating that the bind-
ing site for bafilomycin is near the binding site(s) for DCCD and
may thus be located in the proteolipid, subunit c. However,
because DCCD, especially at the rather high concentration of 1
mM, may bind to sites different from that in the proteolipid and
may bind not only to carboxyl groups but also to sulfhydryl
groups or to tyrosine residues (9), and since the 100-kDa sub-
unit a was not clearly resolved in this study, the bafilomycin
binding subunit was still not identified. Strong hints in favor of
subunit c representing the bafilomycin binding subunit were
provided by recent results from analysis of Neurospora crassa
strains, indicating that those with point mutations in subunit c
show a higher tolerance to bafilomycin (I50 80–400 nM) com-
pared with the wild type (I50 6.3 nM); interestingly, the toler-
ance to concanamycin was not changed simultaneously (10).

Based on extensive screening studies of systematically mod-
ified derivatives of concanamycin, a probe was designed that
still inhibits V-ATPase activity and which generates upon
UV-irradiation a covalent bond between the inhibitor and the
V-ATPase (11, 12). In the present report we show for the first
time that this derivative of concanamycin A, 9-O-[p-(trifluoro-
ethyldiazirinyl)-benzoyl]-21,23-dideoxy-23-[125I]iodo-concanol-

ide A (J-concanolide A), binds only to subunit c of the V-ATPase
from tobacco hornworm (M. sexta) midgut.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Purification of the V1/Vo ATPase and the Vo Complex—As many as 20
whole M. sexta midguts were dissected from feeding fifth instar larvae
and homogenized in ice-cold buffer A (5 mM Tris-HCl, 250 mM sucrose,
5 mM Pefabloc SC (Biomol), 5 mM Na-EDTA, pH 8.1). After centrifuga-
tion of the crude homogenate in a fixed-angle rotor at 12,000 ⫻ gmax for
5 min at 4 °C, the pellet was resuspended in buffer A and centrifuged
again. The resulting pellet was resuspended in buffer A and centrifuged
in a fixed-angle rotor at 233,000 ⫻ gmax for 30 min at 4 °C to yield a final
pellet that was solubilized in buffer B (16 mM Tris-HCl, 0.32 mM EDTA,
9.6 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and 0.1% C12E10, pH 8.1) at 4 °C with a
detergent to protein ratio of 2:1. After centrifugation in a fixed-angle
rotor at 233,000 ⫻ gmax for 1 h at 4 °C, the supernatant was layered on
a discontinuous sucrose density gradient (3 ml of 40%, 2 ml of 30%, 2 ml
of 20%, and 1.6 ml of 10% sucrose (w/v) dissolved in buffer B with 200
mM KCl and a lower detergent concentration of 0.01% C12E10) and
centrifuged in a vertical rotor at 339,000 ⫻ gmax for 90 min at 4 °C. The
30% sucrose fraction was diluted 4-fold with buffer C (20 mM Tris-HCl,
9.6 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% C12E10, pH 8.1) containing 50 mM
NaCl and subjected to anion exchange chromatography using a Mono Q
(Amersham Biosciences) column. The V1/Vo ATPase was eluted in a
linear salt gradient (50–400 mM NaCl dissolved in buffer C) at NaCl
concentrations between 250 and 280 mM. The last step in the purifica-
tion protocol was gel permeation chromatography on a Superdex 200
column (Amersham Biosciences), which was performed in buffer C
containing 150 mM NaCl. The final yield was ⬃1 mg of V-ATPase per 20
midguts.

For purification of the Vo complex, midguts of larvae starved for
16–20 h were prepared, homogenized, and centrifuged twice as de-
scribed above. The second pellet was resuspended in a buffer consisting
of 5 mM Tris-HCl, 0.8 M KI, 5 mM Na-EDTA, and 5 mM Pefabloc SC (pH
8.1) and incubated for 30 min on ice. Then the sample was diluted with
16 mM Tris-HCl, 0.32 mM EDTA, 9.6 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (pH 8.1) to
a KI concentration of 40 mM and centrifuged at 233,000 ⫻ gmax for 30
min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in the dilution buffer and
centrifuged again under the same conditions. The final pellet was
solubilized and purified as described above for the V1/Vo ATPase, except
for the use of 20% instead of the 30% sucrose fraction after rate zonal
centrifugation. The final yield of the preparation was ⬃0.5 mg of Vo
complex per 20 midguts.

Antibiotics—J-concanolide A as well as its 125I-labeled form were
synthesized as described elsewhere (11). Concanamycin A, bafilomycin
A1, and bafilomycin B1 were isolated according to published procedures
(12). Salicylihalamide was a generous gift from M. R. Boyd (National
Cancer Institute, MD, USA). To avoid freeze thaw cycles, which have
significant influence on the stability of the substances, aliquots of stock
solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide were stored at ⫺70 °C and thawed only
once immediately before use. The actual concentrations of the stock
solutions were determined spectrophotometrically.

ATPase Assays—ATPase assays with a final volume of 160 ␮l and a
pH of 8.1 contained 3–4 ␮g of protein, 50 mM Tris-Mops, 3 mM 2-mer-
captoethanol, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mM
sodium azide, 20 mM KCl, 0.003% C12E10, 20 mM NaCl, and 3 mM
Tris-HCl. After 5 min of preincubation at 30 °C with or without inhib-
itors, 1 mM Tris-ATP was added, and after an additional 2 min the
reaction was stopped by placing the reaction tubes in liquid nitrogen.
Determination of the produced inorganic phosphate followed the proto-
col of Wieczorek et al. (13).

Labeling—20 ␮g of the samples were incubated with varying concen-
trations of J-concanolide A in a volume of 30–40 ␮l for 1 h on ice or 3
min at room temperature and irradiated for 3 min with UV light (366
nm) on ice. After irradiation, 7.5–10 ␮l of 5-fold sample buffer (14) was
added. The mixture was heated for 45 s at 95 °C or 30 min at 40 °C,
cooled on ice, and subjected to SDS-PAGE (10–15% T, 3.3% C; (15)) or
to Tricine-SDS-PAGE (16.5% T, 3% C separating gel and 10% T, 3% C
spacer gel (16)), followed by Coomassie staining. The gels were either
dried on Whatman paper or sealed in plastic wrap before they were
exposed to a phosphoscreen for as many as 72 h and analyzed with the
aid of a phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics).

Mass Spectrometric Analysis—After SDS-PAGE of the purified V1/Vo
ATPase, the 100-kDa and the 17-kDa Coomassie-stained bands, respec-
tively, were prepared for mass spectrometry in a procedure adapted
from Shevchenko et al. (17) and Zhang et al. (18). Briefly, the proteins
were digested by trypsin or chymotrypsin in the gel, and the peptides

were mapped using MALDI-MS (TofSpec-2E, Micromass Ltd.,
Manchester, UK).

Other Procedures—Fifth instar larvae of M. sexta (Lepidoptera,
Sphingidae), weighing 6–8 g, were reared under long-day conditions
(16 h of light) at 27 °C using a synthetic diet modified according to Bell
et al. (19). The preparation of highly purified goblet cell apical mem-
branes followed published protocols (13, 20). SDS-PAGE, Western blot-
ting on nitrocellulose membranes, and immunostaining were performed
as described previously (13, 21).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Revised Purification Protocol Reveals Subunit a in the Insect
V-ATPase—The unequivocal assignment of an inhibitor such
as concanamycin or bafilomycin to a special V-ATPase subunit
requires experimental evidence for the existence of all consti-
tutive subunits in the V-ATPase preparation used. Although
nearly all subunits of the insect V-ATPase have been cloned
and sequenced (22, 23), we had so far not been able to identify
the 100-kDa subunit a of the insect V-ATPase unequivocally
(24–26). Because this subunit on the one hand appeared to be
very sensitive to proteolysis (27), and on the other hand was
proposed to be a candidate for bafilomycin binding (7), we
repeatedly modified purification protocols to recover a putative
subunit a, also in the insect V-ATPase. Degradation during the
process of purification was evidently not responsible for our
lack of evidence because even with complex cocktails of prote-
ase inhibitors we were not able to resolve subunit a (28).

Purification of the M. sexta V-ATPase according to a new
protocol as compared with previous procedures (Ref. 24, see
under “Experimental Procedures”) resulted, mainly because of
the presence of 200 mM KCl during zonal centrifugation of the
detergent-solubilized protein in a sucrose gradient, for the first
time in the detection of a 100-kDa subunit in an insect
V-ATPase preparation (Fig. 1, lane 3). The 100-kDa band re-
acted in immunoblots with polyclonal antibodies to the 116-
kDa subunit a of the V-ATPase from bovine chromaffin gran-
ules (Ref. 29, not shown, but see below the results for the Vo
complex), suggesting the existence of a 100-kDa subunit a, also
in the M. sexta midgut V-ATPase. Respective evidence had
already been provided recently by the demonstration of at least
two genes encoding a V-ATPase subunit a in the midgut (23).
Definitive proof that the 100-kDa band represented the
V-ATPase subunit a was finally obtained from MALDI-MS. A
number of tryptic peptides were found in the map of the protein
