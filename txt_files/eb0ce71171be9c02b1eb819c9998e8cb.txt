ABSTRACT. Biomass content and turnover rate were estimated for a lowland wet
rain forest in French Guiana. A regression model relating the biomass of a tree to
its dbh (diameter at breast height) was deduced from previously published data. A
power-law allometric relationship of the form AGTB = aDb was used to estimate the
tree biomass, AGTB (Mg ha–1), from its dbh D (cm). Using direct measurements of
tree biomass in the literature, the best-ﬁt allometric exponent b = 2.42 (SD = 0.02)
was found. The logarithm of the coefﬁcient a was normally distributed with an aver-
age of - 2.00 (SD = 0.27). This method was applied to two permanent research sta-
tions of the lowland tropical rain forest of French Guiana: the Nouragues and Piste
de Saint-Elie. At the Nouragues, the biomass was estimated from trees 10 cm in dia-
meter on two plots covering a total surface area of 22 ha and yielded an average bio-
mass of 309 Mg ha- 1 (– 32 Mg ha- 1, 95% conﬁdence interval). Spatial variability was
also addressed at the Nouragues by estimating the biomass of trees M 30 cm dbh over
a total surface area of 82 ha. For the wet tropical forest vegetation type, an average
of 284 Mg ha- 1 was obtained (spatial variability – 55 Mg ha- 1). Biomass turnover was
evaluated at Piste de Saint-Elie from two transects (0.78 and 1 ha) on which all trees
M 5 cm in diameter were recorded and mapped twice in 10 y. Transect 1 showed a
slight increase in biomass, from 245 to 260 Mg ha- 1 (338 to 345 Mg ha- 1 for transect
2), corresponding to a net increase of 1.9 Mg ha- 1 y- 1 (0.7 Mg ha- 1 y- 1), and the bio-
mass ingrowth was 3.2 Mg ha- 1 y- 1 (2.8 Mg ha- 1 y- 1). These ﬁgures are discussed in
the light of the natural recruitment dynamics of tropical forests.

INTRODUCTION

Biomass is an important parameter for characterizing a forest ecosystem. The
efﬁciency of carbon storage in organic matter reﬂects the quality of environ-
mental conditions: climate, soil structure and nutrient availability. A precise

knowledge of the biomass is crucial for harvesting assessments (Vanclay 1995)
and, at a much larger scale, for the study of greenhouse warming scenarios
(Houghton et al. 2000, Shukla et al. 1990). Atmospheric carbon uptake by the
vegetation is believed to play a major role in the global climate changes of the
century to come (Fan et al. 1998, Phillips et al. 1998). An estimated 37% (428
Pg = 428.1015 g) of the world’s living terrestrial carbon pool (1146 Pg) is stored
in tropical forests (Dixon et al. 1994), more than half of which is in the neo-
tropics (53%).

Although the need is great, little is known about inter-site and temporal
variability of forest biomass in tropical zones, compared to the large amount
of information available in temperate regions (see Brown 1997 for a recent
review). Previous studies on biomass estimates for tropical forests range
between 148 and 669 Mg ha- 1 (1 Mg ha- 1 = 106 g ha- 1), the latter from Kira
(1971). Direct assessment of the aboveground biomass is strenuous; all trees
must be felled and weighed in a small sample area, in order to parameterize
a regression method. Moreover, direct biomass estimates are generally based
upon small sample units, typically less than 100 trees M 10 cm dbh, that is,
less than 1/5 ha. Large trees (M 70 cm dbh) have an overwhelming weight in
the average biomass content of a forest and they may be under or over-
represented in small sampling units. Therefore, even direct biomass estimates
should be interpreted with caution. In the absence of any such data, the use of
functional relationships between surrogate variables, such as the dbh, and the
biomass, is the most natural way to proceed, provided the error on such estim-
ates is systematically investigated (I. F. Brown et al. 1995).

In the present paper, we propose an estimation method for the biomass of a
lowland tropical rainforest in French Guiana. We give a new argument based
on theoretical considerations, to justify the power-law allometric relationship
between biomass and dbh. A careful analysis of previously published data on
tree biomass in similar forest types provides an estimation of the error on the
coefﬁcients of the regression model. This method is then applied to two per-
manent plots in French Guiana: the Nouragues Research Station (100 km
inland) and the Piste de Saint-Elie Research Station (coastal rain forest).
Finally, we discuss the reliability of our estimates, and the inﬂuence of soil on
the spatial variation of the biomass.

STUDY AREA

French Guiana

French Guiana, an overseas French territory, lies between 2(cid:176) 10¢ and 5(cid:176) 45¢ N
and 51(cid:176) 40¢ and 54(cid:176) 30¢ W in northeastern South America. Of the region, 97% is
covered by lowland wet tropical forest (Figure 1). A phytogeographic descrip-
tion of the region is found in Lindeman & Moolenaar (1959) and Lindeman &
Mori (1989). Annual rainfall is between 1650 and 4000 mm- 1, with a decreasing
gradient from the coastal area to the southern tip of the country. A pronounced
