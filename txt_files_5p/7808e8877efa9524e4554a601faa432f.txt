	“Palahniuk	un>linchingly	reveals	the	dark	
compulsion	and	actions	of	characters	
struggling	to	>ind	ful>illment	in	a	postmodern	
world	where	the	Orwellian	power	of	mass	
media	and	the	crushing	weight	of	the	past	
make	doing	so	all	but	impossible.”	(Kuhn	1)

Critique	of	a	Consumerist	Culture	Industry	

Themes	Approaching	Invisible	Monsters	
		
“From	Shannon	watching	herself	on	TV	to	the	audience	watching	itself	on	the	monitors,	the	scene	
is	>illed	with	narcissism	–	a	kind	of	visual	cannibalism.	Instead	of	mouths	devouring	substance,	
though,	the	eyes	become	the	organs	of	consumption,	constantly	returning	to	the	videoscreens	for	
another	visual	helping.”	(Johnson	64)	
“[T]he	principle	characters	in	Invisible	Monsters	perform	violence	upon	their	own	bodies	as	a	
desperate	resort	to	experience	“aliveness.”	…	[I]t	is	only	by	“turning	monstrous”	that	subjects	
may	be	able	to	redeem	their	identity	from	a	culture	saturated	with	constructed	and	over-
determined	semblances	of	self.”	(Ng	24)	
“Self-mutilation,	a	recurring	motif	in	Invisible	Monsters,	presents	the	body	with	the	possibility	of	
subverting	culture’s	domination	in	order	to	reassert	itself	as	identity.	…	Only	through	pain,	
suffering,	and	bodily	dis>igurement,	Palahniuk	seems	to	suggest,	can	“identity”	become	
personalized	as	authentic	experience	(as	in,	this	pain,	and	therefore	this	body,	are	undeniably	
mine).”	(Ng	25-26)

Gender,	Sex,	Bodily	Performances	

Themes	Approaching	Invisible	Monsters	
		
“For	Shane,	traditional	de>initions	of	sexuality	and	gender	are	too	restrictive.	He	refuses	to	be	
bound	by	a	closed	system,	especially	one	bound	by	language.	His	struggle,	therefore,	is	not	merely	
an	internal	one	to	reinvent	himself,	but	also	is	against	society	as	well.	He	is	not	content	to	let	
others	de>ine	him;	he	must	challenge	their	assumptions	and	their	perceptions	of	reality,	
too.”	(Johnson	66)		
“Experience	is,	of	course,	most	directly	encountered	through	and	by	the	body.	But	if	…	the	body	
too	is	itself	a	socio-ideological	construction,	then	it	is	not	only	experience	that	has	become	
invalid,	but	the	body	as	well”.	(Ng	25)	
“[W]hy	depict	femininity	that	is	monstrous	in	order	to	make	an	explicit	criticism	of	a	culture	
industry	premised	on	materialism	and	uninhibited	hedonism?	It	is	possible	to	argue	that	the	
Invisible	Monster’s	deployment	of	such	gendered	con>igurations	works	to	subvert	the	patriarchal	
structure	that	postmodern	culture	continues	to	support,	and	more	insidiously,	to	camou>lage.”		
(Ng	33)

Themes	Approaching	Invisible	Monsters	
		
“[T]here	is	power	too	in	the	limbo	of	Shane's	unclear	gender	identi>ication.	He	joins	ranks	with	
the	gender	defenders,	the	outlaws	willing	to	bang	their	heads	against	the	dual	binaries	of	
traditional	gender	roles,	whose	very	lives	prove	that	gender	is	as	ambiguous	and	>luid	as	race	or	
class.	Shane's	unwanted	and	incomplete	gender	change	is	part	of	his	deliberate	rejection	of	the	
homogeneity	of	performative	gender	typically	understood	as	actual	gender	in	popular	
culture.”	(Johnson	68)		

Challenge	of	Binary	Assumptions

Strife	for	Genuine	Identity/Authenticity	of	the	Individual	

Themes	Approaching	Invisible	Monsters	
		
“[T]he	pointlessness	of	experience	renders	the	subject	adrift	in	a	capitalist	sea	of	>loating	
signi>iers,	where	humans	have	only	equal	worth	to,	or	even	lesser	than,	things.	Merely	material,	
the	subject	is	then	categorized	in	terms	of	how	he	[sic!]	‘matters’	to	the	culture	industry	that	
prescribes	value	to	him.	[sic!]”	(Ng	25)	
“By	destroying	her	beauty	[Shannon]	takes	control	of	her	body's	social	capital.	Her	actions	re>lect	
her	understanding	of	her	beauty	as	power,	and	the	extreme	nature	of	her	decision	shows	that	she	
realizes	her	susceptibility	to	trading	in	her	beauty.	[…]	she	speaks	of	her	mutilation	in	terms	of	
rebirth:	'Here	was	my	life	about	to	start	all	over	again'	(287).	Like	any	birth,	though,	the	act	will	
be	violent,	bloody,	and	irreversible.”	(Johnson	68)	
“The	siblings'	reconciliation	is	central	to	the	novel,	as	it	re>lects	a	theme	that	Palahniuk	attributes	
to	all	his	works:	human	connection.	[…]	His	use	of	violence	is	not	nihilistic	–	it	does	not	represent	
nothingness	–	it	is	life-af>irming,	an	attempt	to	discard	the	distractions	that	separate	people	from	
others	and	from	themselves.”	(Johnson	70-71)
