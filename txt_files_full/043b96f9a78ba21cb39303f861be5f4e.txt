Forming student groups

Speed dating

 Any groups have already been formed?

– If so: fine! + Think whether you need more participants

 One round, everybody says one or more topics s/he finds

interesting

 Collecting topics, clustering similar topics
 3 x 3 minutes to talk in clusters to those who mentioned an 

interesting topic => forming groups

 Further steps for group formation

 Groups will have a section in Stud.IP to organize themselves and

see who is a member
