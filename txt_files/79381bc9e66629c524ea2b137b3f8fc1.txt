Question:  
Are there different neural correlates for 
attention and awareness?  
 
Method: 
2x2 factorial design (visibility of the  
  target stimulus x directed attention)  
fMRI Study (focus on V1)  with binocular  
  supression  
 
Results:  
highly significant effect of attention on  
  BOLD response  
no effect of visibility on BOLD response  
 
Conclusion:  
Neural processes of attention may extend 
to lower levels in the visual hierarchy in 
contrast to processes of visual awareness 

Magenta : Target visible + attention to target   
Cyan: Target invisible + attention to target  
Red: Target visible + attention to nontarget block   
Blue: Target invisible +attention to nontarget block
