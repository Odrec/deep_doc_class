In this paper, we present the results of the construction and validation of a new psycho-
metric tool for measuring beliefs about free will and related concepts: The Free Will Inven-
tory (FWI). In its ﬁnal form, FWI is a 29-item instrument with two parts. Part 1 consists of
three 5-item subscales designed to measure strength of belief in free will, determinism,
and dualism. Part 2 consists of a series of fourteen statements designed to further explore
the complex network of people’s associated beliefs and attitudes about free will, determin-
ism, choice, the soul, predictability, responsibility, and punishment. Having presented the
construction and validation of FWI, we discuss several ways that it could be used in future
research, highlight some as yet unanswered questions that are ripe for interdisciplinary
investigation, and encourage researchers to join us in our efforts to answer these questions.

1. Introduction

Philosophers have long debated the nature of free will and moral responsibility. Psychologists have more recently joined
the fray. While some researchers have tried to shed empirical light on the debate concerning whether we have free will, typ-
ically concluding that we do not (e.g., Bargh, 2008; Harris, 2012; Libet, 1999; Wegner, 2002), others have focused instead on
exploring our beliefs about free will and the role they play in our daily lives (e.g., Alquist, Ainsworth, & Baumeister, 2013;
Bergner & Ramon, 2013; Haynes, Rojas, & Viney, 2003; Nettler, 1959; Nettler, 1961; Ogletree & Oberle, 2008; Pronin & Kug-
ler, 2010; Schooler, Nadelhoffer, Nahmias, & Vohs, in press; Stillman & Baumeister, 2010; Stillman et al., 2010; Stroessner &
Green, 1990; Viney, Parker-Martin, & Dotten, 1988; Viney, Waldman, & Barchilon, 1982; Waldman, Viney, Bell, Bennett, &
Hess, 1983). Each of these two projects is interesting and important in its own right. For present purposes, we focus on
the psychology of believing in free will—a topic that has received increasing attention in the wake of gathering evidence that
challenging people’s beliefs about free will may inﬂuence their behavior in surprising and sometimes alarming ways. For
example, telling people they do not have free will has been shown to increase cheating (Vohs & Schooler, 2008) decrease
helping behavior and increases aggression (Baumeister, Masicampo, & DeWall, 2009), reduce self-control (Rigoni, Kuhn,
