Friedman (1970) 

 Only persons can have responsibilities 
 Engaging in CSR implies: taking other people’s 
money (’taxation’); except for entrepeneurs 
(taking their own money) 

 Political issues to be handled by political 

institutions:  
 Managers not specialised in social issues 
 Lack of democratic legitimacy (’taxation’) 

 Responsibility: to increase profits (within the 

rules of the game) 

 … 

Dr. Detlef Aufderheide

Corporate social responsibility 

 In what sense may M. Friedman’s approach 

turn out to be too narrow? 

 Consider, e.g. 

 Societal expectations: “licence to operate” can be at stake 
 Incomplete contracts in markets 
 Loopholes in the set of rules 

Dr. Detlef Aufderheide

Corporate Social Responsibility 
(CSR) 

 Just a fashion 
or 
 A long-term movement? 
 It would depend on the mindsets as applied to 

CSR. 

Detlef Aufderheide 

9 

CSR: Pros 

 Companies: increased political power 
 Government: decreased power 

 Globalisation 
 Political competition for the most attractive industrial 
locations (Downward spiral? Tax race to the bottom?) 

 Governments losed power as (strong) regulators 

 Consequence: Proft-based businesses’ licence to 

operate at stake. 
 Micro level (‘plays of the game’): lost markets/market 

shares via boycots, lost reputation 

 Macro level (‘rules of the game’): takings 

 

Dr. Detlef Aufderheide 

10 

Case Study 

 Case Study reconsidered: Mr. Special (Dr. Schwarz) 
 Loopholes in the set of societal rules: case for CSR? Illegal practices? 

 

 Individual responsibility - corporate responsibility 

 

 vs. a certain proclivity to corrupt practices? 

Dr. Detlef Aufderheide 

11 

Case Study: Personal Luxury or 
Family Loyalty 

 Responsibility of Joe – to whom? 
 Please explain 
 Would you recommend to Motorola a change 

of company rules? 

Dr. Detlef Aufderheide 

12 

Case Study: Personal Luxury or 
Family Loyalty 

 Joe is torn between two responsibilities. 

Please explain. 

 Would you identify his family loyalty, 
compared with European or Northern 
American values, as being an example of 
cultural differences? Could you imagine an 
additional aspect or explanation? 

Dr. Detlef Aufderheide 

13 

Case Study: Personal Luxury or 
Family Loyalty 

 When solving the case, we can ask different questions, 

depending on the respective level of human action we refer 
to (e.g., level of individual decisions/individual interaction – 
level of company rules). 

 We can, e.g., ask whether Motorola’s managers are right to 

fire Joe (please present the respective arguments supporting 
both possible answers, i.e.,  “Yes” and “No”.) 

 … or why Joe may not have had a moral right to serve his 

family’s interest in the way he did. 

Dr. Detlef Aufderheide 

14 

Case Study: Personal Luxury or 
Family Loyalty 

 An approach that may broaden our view of the problem – 
thereby offering a broadened view of available solutions – 
is to shift  the question to the level of rules, especially to 
company rules: 

 What is the current policy (company rule) of Motorola 

with respect to their local employees’ housing? By what 
goals does Motorola justify the adopted rule? 

 In what sense may the creation of new moral dilemmas be 
avoided by modified company rules? What would the pros 
and cons be from the viewpoint of the company? 

Dr. Detlef Aufderheide 

15 

Levels of actions reconsidered 

 When solving the case, we should reconsider 

the distinction between the levels of 
 individual interaction (decisions), 
 company rules and 
 social rules. 

 Bottom-up approach.

Business ethics in a democratic 
society: Propositions 

 Prop. 1. Profit-seeking as such is not a behaviour 

the company is to be blamed for. 
 Ethical dimension of competition: Expectation of 

profits creates incentives to be efficient, innovative, 
competitive (by offering competitive goods and 
services at reasonable prices). 

 There is no significant difference within pursuit of 

success in sports on the one hand and in markets on 
the other hand: competition forces the players to serve 
public interest whilst they are nevertheless required to 
play fair. 

Dr. Detlef Aufderheide 

19 

Business ethics in a democratic 
society: Propositions 

 As a consequence, corporate social responsibility 
no. 1 is: To strive for success in markets with fair 
means. 

 In other words: The task is to provide customers 

with competitive goods at reasonable prices 
whilst playing by the rules of the game (including 
responsibilities towards others than customers).

Business strategies when rules 
do not work sufficiently – 
Poposition #2 (p. 1 of 2) 

 Quite frequently, there are cases where mere 

compliance is insufficient. 
 (1) There is no social rule at all (or not yet a rule) as the 

problem is unforeseen or totally new. 

• Examples: genetic engineering; accounting rules; globalised 

markets 

 (2) A rule exists but sanctions do not work properly. 
• Example: accounting rules (Enron, WorldCom); corruption 

(Siemens). 

 

Dr. Detlef Aufderheide 

21 

Business strategies for cases where 
rules do not work sufficiently – 
Poposition #2 (p. 2 of 2) 

  This leads to Proposition 2: Corporate social 

responsibility no. 2 is to search for better rules – 
on the company level and/or on the social level. 
 As a consequence, two strategy dimensions have 

to be taken into account (see following slides). 

 

Dr. Detlef Aufderheide 

22 

The two strategy dimensions 
of the company 

 Strategy dimension #1: Creating innovative 

company rules 
 Transparency, incentives, organisational modes: The 

company‘s “square of values“ as a square of strategies 
(see slides below). 

 Strategy dimension #2: Lobbying for better 

social rules (see case study: corruption in 
the city of Somewhere). 

Dr. Detlef Aufderheide 

23 

Square of Values – square of institutional 
strategies (see Wieland 1999, 
Wieland/Grüninger) 

Performance values 
- key field -  
Benefit and Quality 
Competence 
Willingness to perform 
Flexibility 
Creativity 
Innovative ability 
 

Cooperation values 
Loyalty 
Team spirit 
“Conflict Ability” 
Open-mindedness 
Communicative skills 

Communication values 
Respect 
Social affiliation 
Open-mindedness 
Transparency 
Understanding 

Moral values 
Integrity 
Fairness 
Sincerity/honesty 
Responsibility 

Dr. Detlef Aufderheide 

24 

A Proviso 

 Please note that the realisation of any value in the square 
depends on the “key variable“: sustained success of your 
company in the market, gained by fair means. If it is not 
successful, it will be among the first to quit the market. 
 Rule of thumb: Ethics-sensitive companies will develop 
strategies that better serve public interest whilst at the 
same time ensure the company‘s  licence to operate and, 
on the long run, even increase the company‘s profits (Win-
Win).

of values/the square of 
strategies (cf. Wieland)

Value Management Systems (VMS)

Strategy dimensions and their 
order (1) 

 What is the appropriate order of these two 

strategy dimensions? 

 A company may adopt both of them at the 

same time. 

 Usually, however, it is appropriate to check 

a unilateral (one-sided) action first: There 
may be an opportunity to, at the same 
time, obtain a competitive advantage 
through adopting an ethical strategy. There 
is … 

Dr. Detlef Aufderheide 

30 

Strategy dimensions and their 
order (2) 

 … no need to feel ashamed for an ethical 

strategy that leads to success in business -  
as long as the strategy itself is really 
suitable as a means of obtaining an ethical 
goal and not just “Window-dressing”.  

Dr. Detlef Aufderheide 

31 

“Recipe”: Two business 
strategies and their relation 
toward each other (1) 

 (1) Consider a strategy of type #1 first: Your company 

can adopt it directly (unilaterally).  

 (2) Check: Do you expect to be successful  

 in moral/ethical terms? If your tentative answer is “Yes“: 

proceed to step (3). If “No“: Proceed to step (5). 

 (3) Check: Do you expect to be sufficiently successful 

 in terms of profits? 

• Short-term 
• Mid-term 
• Long-term. 

 

Dr. Detlef Aufderheide 

32 

“Recipe”: Two business 
strategies and their relation 
toward each other (2) 

 (4) If your tentative answer is “Yes“ to a 

degree you regard as sufficient: It is time to 
take action. Realise your comparative 
advantage over your competitors. 
 If “No“: Be creative and consider another option that 

you can adopt unilaterally: Go back to step (1). 

 If you cannot imagine any other potentially successful 

options: Proceed to step (5). 

Dr. Detlef Aufderheide 

33 

“Recipe”: Two business 
strategies and their relation 
toward each other (3) 

 (5) By adopting a unilateral strategy (changing the 

company rules, organisational modes ...), you do not 
expect to be successful in moral terms nor in terms of 
profits within a reasonable period of time. Now, lobby for 
an improvement of social rules 
 on a local scale or 
 on a national scale or 
 on an international scale (especially tedious task!). 

 If your company is large enough: do that directly. If it is 

not: Lobby via the representatives of your industry. 

 

Dr. Detlef Aufderheide 

34 

Business strategy dimension 
#1: A more detailed view 

 (1) Recognising the company‘s square of 

values. 

 (2) Implementation of value management 

systems (VMS).

 We now return to the corporate level and reconsider 
different strategies against corruption. Please reprint 
the matrix (see below), leaving sufficient space, and 
fill in the cells. 

 Can you consider other strategies that may be 

potentially effective? 

 After that, use the check list above and consider 

improved social rules.

Summary on strategy 
dimensions 

 When it comes to ethical dilemmas (ethical 

problems) we have to conceptually 
distinguish between two business strategy 
dimensions.  

 Strategy dimension #1 

 Creating innovative company rules 

 Srategy dimension #2 

 Lobbying for better social rules 

Dr. Detlef Aufderheide 

39 

Restrictions and objections (1) 

 What restrictions and/or what objections 
against the procedures as discussed above 
may be presented? How about counter-
arguments? 

 Cf., e.g., Wieland/Grüninger (2003), pp. 126 ff. 

 

Dr. Detlef Aufderheide 

40 

Restrictions and objections (2) 

 Do not forget to consider an opportunity that 

is frequently neglected: the complementary 
(or alternative) approach of the company‘s 
lobbying for a change in societal rules. 

Dr. Detlef Aufderheide 

41 

Restrictions and objections (3) 

 What if a manager has decided for himself or 

herself that “only money counts“? 

 Even in this case he or her should consider this 

approach. Ignorance may, in future, cost not 
only reputation but a lot of money as well: 
See, e.g. Ian Wilson‘s hint (see following 
page.) 

Dr. Detlef Aufderheide 

42 

 “The societal expectations of yesterday become the 

political issues of today, and the legislative 
requirements of tomorrow, and the litigated 
penalties of the day after.“

Touchstones for workable 
corporate codes of ethics 

1) Does the code include effective sanctions? 
2)

Is the code credible (symmetric conditions for 
buying centre and sales department, e.g.)? 

3) Do the duties comprise decisions of the top levels 

of management? 
„No code“ is less dysfunctional than a bad code.
