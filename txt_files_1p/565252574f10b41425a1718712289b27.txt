pestilence had ever been so fatal, or so hideous. Blood was 
its Avatar and its seal—the redness and the horror of blood. 
There  were  sharp  pains,  and  sudden  dizziness,  and  then 
profuse bleeding at the pores, with dissolution. The scarlet 
stains  upon  the  body  and  especially  upon  the  face  of  the 
victim, were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid 
and  from  the  sympathy  of  his  fellow-men.  And  the  whole 
seizure,  progress,  and  termination  of  the  disease,  were  the 
incidents of half an hour.  
But the Prince Prospero was happy and dauntless and 
sagacious.  When  his  dominions  were  half  depopulated,  he 
summoned to his presence a thousand hale and light-hearted 
friends from among the knights and dames of his court, and 
with  these  retired  to  the  deep  seclusion  of  one  of  his 
castellated  abbeys.  This  was  an  extensive  and  magnificent 
structure,  the  creation  of  the  prince’s  own  eccentric  yet 
august taste. A strong and lofty wall girdled it in. This wall 
had  gates  of  iron.  The  courtiers,  having  entered,  brought 
furnaces  and  massy  hammers  and  welded  the  bolts.  They 
resolved to leave means neither of ingress nor egress to the 
sudden  impulses  of  despair  or  of  frenzy  from  within.  The 
abbey  was  amply  provisioned.  With  such  precautions  the 
courtiers might bid defiance to contagion. The external world 
could  take  care  of  itself.  In  the  meantime  it  was  folly  to 
grieve,  or  to  think.  The  prince  had  provided  all  the 
appliances  of  pleasure.  There  were  buffoons,  there  were 
improvisatori, 
there  were 
musicians, there was Beauty, there was wine. All these and 
security were within. Without was the “Red Death.”
