9) The following aspect of the presentation leaves room for improvement: 
- should practice to talk English 
- second speaker should address audience; not stare on text cards too much 
- when they state “we will explain this later” they should indicate when they revisit the 
topic 
- animations are fine but too many of them and it becomes exhausting 
- if using cards, make them good 
- talk without cards (4x) 
- one speaker lost track 
- some typo’s in text (not so bad…)
