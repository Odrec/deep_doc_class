predator–prey model

Abstract. We present a complete parametric analysis of stability properties and dynamic
regimes of an ODE model in which the functional response is a function of the ratio of
prey and predator abundances. We show the existence of eight qualitatively different types
of system behaviors realized for various parameter values. In particular, there exist areas of
coexistence (which may be steady or oscillating), areas in which both populations become
extinct, and areas of “conditional coexistence” depending on the initial values. One of the
main mathematical features of ratio-dependent models, distinguishing this class from other
predator–prey models, is that the Origin is a complicated equilibrium point, whose charac-
teristics crucially determine the main properties of the model. This is the ﬁrst demonstration
of this phenomenon in an ecological model. The model is investigated with methods of the
qualitative theory of ODEs and the theory of bifurcations. The biological relevance of the
mathematical results is discussed both regarding conservation issues (for which coexistence
is desired) and biological control (for which extinction is desired).

1. Introduction

The construction and study of models for the population dynamics of predator–prey
systems have remained an important area in theoretical ecology since the famous
Lotka-Volterra equations. These authors set a framework which is still followed
today: a system of two differential equations, with a simple correspondence (usually
proportionality) between prey consumption and predator production. A most crucial
element in these models is the “functional response” or “trophic function”, the
function that describes the number of prey consumed per predator per unit time for
given quantities of prey N and predators P .

Much early work was only concerned with the way in which this function varies
with prey density (e.g., the so-called Holling types I, II, III), ignoring the effect of
predator density. Even today, most simulation models developed for applications

assume that the trophic function is a function of prey density only. This was labeled
“prey-dependence” by Arditi and Ginzburg (1989).

It is known that only stable equilibrium coexistence of predators and prey or ex-
tinction of predators are possible in the framework of the “classical” Lotka-Volterra
model with quadratic (logistic) prey growth. An additional regime of oscillating
coexistence can arise in various models with saturation of the trophic function (e.g.,
Rosenzweig 1971, Bazykin 1998).

Note that such models cannot describe the experimental observations (e.g.,
Huffaker 1958, Luckinbill 1973) that, with given values of system parameters,
the predator population or both populations can either become extinct or coexist,
depending on the initial population values. Moreover, the extinction can be accom-
panied by oscillations. Additionally, simple prey-dependent models cannot produce
situations of biological control, i.e., durable coexistence of a pest (the prey) with
its predator at a mean abundance being much lower than the prey carrying ca-
pacity (Luck 1990). This was labelled “paradox of biological control” (Arditi and
Berryman 1991).

It was recognized early that the predator density could have a direct effect on
the trophic function. A number of such “predator-dependent” models (in the sense
of Arditi and Ginzburg 1989) have been proposed, the most widely known being
those of Hassell and Varley (1969), DeAngelis et al. (1975), or Beddington (1975).
Arditi and Ginzburg (1989) have suggested that the essential properties of
predator-dependence could be rendered by a simpler form which was called “ratio-
dependence”. The trophic function is assumed to depend on the single variable N/P
rather than on the two separate variables N and P . When considered in community-
level situations (i.e., food chains and food webs), it was shown that ratio-dependent
models make more reasonable predictions than their prey-dependent counterparts
(Arditi and Berryman 1991, Arditi et al. 1991, Hanski 1991, Michalski and Arditi
1995, Arditi and Michalski 1996).

The ratio-dependent hypothesis has aroused a heated controversy (e.g., Ruxton
and Gurney 1992, Arditi et al. 1992, Abrams 1994, Diehl et al. 1994, Sarnelle 1994,
Akc¸akaya et al. 1995), mainly due to the fact that, at ﬁrst, the main arguments were
phenomenological. However, a number of mechanistic models have now shown
how ratio-dependent (or, more generally, predator-dependent) trophic functions
can emerge on the global scale with the local law of interaction still being the
prey-dependent Lotka-Volterra model. Spatial and/or temporal heterogeneities are
essential ingredients of these mechanistic models (Michalski et al. 1997, Poggiale
et al. 1998, Cosner et al. 1999). Fortunately, the controversy seems to be coming
to a more moderate level, with both parties agreeing on a number of basic points
and recognizing some merits in both approaches (Abrams and Ginzburg 2000).

From the mathematical point of view, ratio-dependent predator–prey models
raise delicate questions because the functional response is undeﬁned at the origin
N = 0, P = 0. As a consequence, the origin is a so-called “complicated point”, as it
will be shown here. Ratio-dependent models can display original dynamic proper-
ties that have never been observed in earlier simple two-dimensional predator–prey
models. For example, the origin can be a node simultaneously attractive and repul-
sive, thus shedding new light on ecological extinction, particularly in the context

of biological control. Coexistence of several dynamic regimes with the same set of
parameters can also be observed. These are realistic features since, as mentioned
above, these behaviors have been observed experimentally.

Several authors have examined speciﬁc mathematical properties of the model,
However, these studies either contained errors (Freedman and Mathsen 1993) or
were only partial (Kuang and Beretta 1998, Beretta and Kuang 1998, Kuang 1999,
Jost et al. 1999). A complete parametric analysis of stability properties and dynamic
regimes had not been achieved until now. This will be the purpose of the present
paper.

2. The ratio-dependent model and its parameterization

The general ratio-dependent prey-predator model of Arditi and Ginzburg (1989) is

Nt = rN ϕ(N ) − g(N/P )P
Pt = eg(N/P )P − qP

where the function rN ϕ(N ) characterizes the velocity of prey growth in the absence
of predators, the linear function qP describes the velocity of predator death in the
absence of prey and the function g(x) = g(N/P ) is the trophic function. The
more speciﬁc form of this model in the present paper assumes the familiar logistic
form for N ϕ(N ) and the Monod-Holling hyperbolic form for g(x) = αx/(1 +
αhx) = αN/(P + αhN ), where (N, P ) ∈ [0,∞)2\(0, 0), G(N > 0, 0) = 1/ h,
G(0, P > 0) = 0 (Jost et al. 1999).
So, we shall study the system

Nt = rN (1 − N/K) − αN P /(P + αhN )
Pt = eαN P /(P + αhN ) − qP

(1)

Besides the densities of prey and predator populations N and P , the parameters of
the system are the non-negative values r, K, α, h, e, q. Here r and K characterize,
respectively, the growth rate and the carrying capacity of the prey population in the
absence of the predator, q is the predator natural mortality rate; e is the conversion
efﬁciency of predators. The parameters α and h characterize the ratio-dependent
trophic function: h is the predator handling time and α is the maximum prey con-
sumption rate.
With appropriate changes of variables (N, P , t ) → (x, y, τ ), the model can be
simpliﬁed to a dimensionless form with a reduced number of independent param-
eters. This makes the mathematical analysis easier while preserving the essential
problems. There exist several formally equivalent different dimensionless forms
having three parameters (which is, in the present model, the lowest possible num-
ber). The choice of the form and the speciﬁc combination of r, K, α, h, e, q as new
parameters are essentially deﬁned by the ecological goal of the study.

In the present paper, our goal is to study the ratio-dependent system mainly
in its dependence on the predator population, i.e., for changes of parameters that
characterize the trophic relations. This leads to the following reduction of model (1):

N = Kx, P = Kαhy, t = τ/r

(2)

224

with the parameters:

ν = α/r, µ = e/(rh), γ = q/r

and the dynamic equations

xτ = x(1 − x) − ν xy/(x + y)
yτ = −γ y + µ xy/(x + y)

F. Berezovskaya et al.

(4)

The parameter γ represents the death rate of the re-deﬁned predators y. The “trophic
components” are characterized by the two parameters ν and µ which have the
following meaning. ν is the maximum (asymptotic) prey death rate due to predation,
for an inﬁnite number of predators; for short, it will be called “the consumption
ability”. µ is the maximum (asymptotic) predator growth rate for an inﬁnite number
of prey; for short, it will be called “the predator growing ability”.

Note that in the work of Jost et al. (1999), model (1) was reduced to a different
form from (2–4) that was appropriate in order to analyze the system mainly in its
dependence on prey characteristics under ﬁxed trophic characters. It is signiﬁcant
that both reductions are equivalent mathematically (see Appendix 4) but serve
different and complementary ecological goals.

In the rest of this paper, we shall study the dynamics of model (4) in its de-
pendence on parameters (µ, ν, γ ). Section 3 contains the formulation of the main
mathematical results of the investigation of system (4), formalized in Theorem
A. Sections 4–6 as well as Appendices A1–A4 are devoted to the proof of this
Theorem. Interpretations of the outcomes and a discussion are in Sections 7 and 8.

3. Purpose of the work and main result

The purpose of the mathematical study of system (4) is to describe completely its
qualitative behavior in a ﬁnite part of the ﬁrst quadrant of the plane (x, y), and its
dependence on the positive parameters γ , µ, ν. For this, we divide the parameter
space into domains corresponding to topologically different phase portraits of sys-
tem (4) in such way that boundaries between the parameter domains correspond to
the bifurcations of the system.
The system (4) has in the ﬁrst quadrant the equilibrium points O(x = 0, y = 0)
and A(x = 1, y = 0) for all parameter values. Additionally, for some parameter
values, the system can have a nontrivial equilibrium point B(x = x∗
) (see
Section 4.1) and a limit cycle “born” from this point (see Section 4.3).

, y = y∗

Moreover, one of the main mathematical peculiarities of ratio-dependent mod-
els, distinguishing this class from many other predator–prey models, is that the
origin O is a complicated equilibrium point for all parameter values. As we show
below, the main peculiarities of system (4) are essentially determined by the char-
acteristics of point O.

The main result is the following.

Theorem A. The space of parameters (γ , µ, ν) is subdivided into 8 domains of
topologically different phase portraits in the ﬁnite part of the positive quadrant of

equilibrium point B (see Fig. 2);

structure of the equilibrium point O in the ﬁrst quadrant under which a node sector
appears/disappears in a vicinity of the point O;
H: ν = µ(γ +µ/(µ−γ ))/(µ+γ ), γ < µ < γ +1 – Andronov-Hopf supercritical
bifurcation of the point B;

L – heteroclinics formed by separatrices of the points A and O. (This boundary
corresponds to a non-local bifurcation and was obtained by computation).
For parameter values α: ν = γ + 1 = µ, the system (4) has a ﬁrst integral of

the form:

(γ + 1)ln((x + y)/x) − y(1 + γ /x) = C,

(5)

where C is an arbitrary constant.

All boundary surfaces correspond to bifurcations of co-dimension1 1 in system (4).
The lines of intersection or touching between the boundary surfaces correspond to
bifurcations of co-dimension 2. Figure 1a represents the 3-dimensional parameter
portrait of the system as a cross-section into the plane (µ, ν) for some arbitrarily
ﬁxed typical value of parameter γ . In this cross-section, surfaces between domains
appear as boundary curves and common lines of these surfaces appear as points of
intersection or touching of the curves.

The proof of the Theorem is provided by the analytical as well as numerical
methods of bifurcation theory (e.g., Arnold 1983; Khibnik et al. 1993; Kuznetsov
1995; Levitin 1989). Table 1 contains examples of parameter values (µ, ν) for a
ﬁxed γ = 1.5, corresponding to the eight domains of Fig. 1a, b.

4. Equilibria of the model

4.1. Zero-isoclines

The system (4) has the following zero-isoclines (see Fig. 2)

xτ = 0 : x = 0 or y = (1 − x)/(x − (1 − ν)),
yτ = 0: y = 0 or y = (µ − γ )x/γ

(6)
So, the system (4) has the equilibria O(x = 0, y = 0), A(x = 1, y = 0) and
B(x = x∗
x∗ = 1−ν(µ−γ )/µ and y∗ = (µ−γ )x∗/γ = (µ−γ )(µ−ν(µ−γ ))/(µγ ) (7)

, y = y∗

), where

The equilibria O and A exist for all parameter values.

From the relations (7), we obtain the parameter conditions for which the point

B is in the interior of the ﬁrst quadrant:

points O and A exist with all parameter values; the point B exists if µ > γ , ν < µ/(µ − γ )
(b–c).

µ > γ , ν < µ/(µ − γ ).

(8)
The equalities µ = γ , ν = µ/(µ − γ ) deﬁne parameter surfaces which are
boundaries between the different phase behaviors of system (4). In Fig. 1a, both
curves BA: µ = γ and BO: ν = µ/(µ − γ ) correspond to the disappearance of
point B from the ﬁrst quadrant. Note that in the ﬁrst case point B passes into the
negative region by merging with point A, whereas in the second case it merges with
point O and disappears. The latter bifurcation has a supplementary degeneracy in
the case ν = γ + 1 = µ, that is, at the parametric point α in portrait 1a (this point
is discussed below).

4.2. Complicated equilibrium point O

The important mathematical peculiarity of system (4) is that the origin is a non-
analytical complicated equilibrium point. The structure of a neighborhood of point
O in the ﬁrst quadrant of the plane (x, y) and the asymptotes of trajectories for
x, y → 0 depend on parameter values and can change in an essential way with a
change of parameters (Fig. 3).

Lemma 1. For different positive values of parameters γ , µ, ν, there exist four
types of topologically different structures of the neighborhood of point O in the ﬁrst
quadrant of the phase plane:
– a saddle sector (Fig. 3a) bounded by separatrices x = 0 and y = 0 for
parameter values 0 < ν < γ + 1, 0 < µ ≤ γ + 1;

228

F. Berezovskaya et al.

(a) saddle sector for 0 < ν < γ + 1, 0 < µ ≤ γ + 1; (b) saddle sector and “attracting node”
sector for γ + 1 < ν < µ/(µ − γ ), 0 < µ < γ + 1; (c) saddle sector and “repelling node”
sector for µ < γ + 1, 0 < ν < µ/(µ − γ ); (d) elliptic sector for ν ≥ µ/(µ − γ ).
– a saddle sector having the separatrix y = 0 and an “attracting node” sector
(containing trajectories tending to 0 with t → ∞) (Fig. 3b) for parameter
values γ + 1 < ν < µ/(µ − γ ), 0 < µ < γ + 1;
– a saddle sector having the separatrix x = 0, and a “repelling node” sector
(containing trajectories which originate from O, i.e. which tend to O with
t → −∞) (Fig. 3c) for parameter values µ < γ + 1, 0 < ν < µ/(µ − γ );
– an elliptic sector composed of trajectories tending to O with t → ∞ as well as
with t → −∞ (Fig. 3d) for parameter values ν ≥ µ/(µ − γ ).

The asymptotic behaviors of characteristic trajectories (having a deﬁnite asymptote
for x, y → 0) in the non-degenerate case (µ−γ −1)(γ +1−ν)(ν−µ/ (µ−γ )) (cid:13)= 0
are described by Lemma 2. Note that these asymptotes can be curvilinear, they are
not necessarily straight lines.
Lemma 2. If µ (cid:13)= γ + 1, ν (cid:13)= γ + 1, then each characteristic trajectory of point
O has an asymptote which belongs to one of the following three types (asymptotes
of the ﬁrst two types form parametric families that depend on an arbitrary positive
constant C).
(9)
which exists if ν > γ + 1 and corresponds to trajectories tending to point O with
t → ∞ (Fig. 3b and d);

Type 1: y = Cxγ /(ν−1)(1 + o(1)),

Parametric analysis of the ratio-dependent predator–prey model
Type 2: y = Cxµ−γ (1 + o(1)),

(10)
which exists if µ > γ + 1 and corresponds to trajectories tending to point O with
t → −∞ (Fig. 3c and d).

229

Finally, the system (4) has in the positive quadrant one or more trajectories

with an asymptote of the third type

Type 3: y = Kx(1 + o(1)), where K = (µ − γ − 1)/(γ + 1 − ν),

(11)

which exists if k > 0. The separatrix of point O (see Fig. 3b and c) is of the form
(11) in parameter domains where γ +1 < ν < µ/(µ− γ ); the set of characteristic
trajectories (Fig. 3d) is of the form (11) in parameter domains ν > µ/(µ − γ ),
γ < µ < γ + 1 and µ/(µ − γ ) < ν < γ + 1, µ > γ + 1.
Remark . On the line of the parameter space α: ν = +1 = µ, the point O is an
equilibrium having an elliptic sector placed in its positive neighborhood and formed
by trajectories with asymptotes

y = Cx(1 + o(1)).

The proofs of the Lemmas are in Appendix 1 and use the version of the blow-up
method associated with the Newton diagram (Berezovskaya 1976, 1995).

4.3. Equilibrim points A and B. Andronov-Hopf bifurcation
The Jacobian J = (aij ) (i, j = 1, 2) of system (4) has the following elements:

a11 ≡ Px = ((1 − x) − νy/(x + y)) + (−x + νxy/(x + y)2),
a12 ≡ Py = −νx2/(x + y)2,
a21 ≡ Qx = µy2/(x + y)2,
a22 ≡ Qy = −γ + µx/(x + y) − µxy/(x + y)2.

(12)

Calculating the determinant and trace of the Jacobian at the equilibrium points A
and B, we obtain the following results.
At point A, det(J) = −(µ − γ ), tr(J) = −1 + (µ − γ ). So, the following

statement holds:

Proposition 1. The point A is a standard saddle if µ > γ and a stable node if
0 < µ < γ .

It is useful to know the directions of the phase trajectories tending to point A.

Due to the system, two of such trajectories are of the form
y = 0 for x > 1, y = 0 for 0 < x < 1

and all other trajectories are of the form:

y = k(x − 1)(1 + o(1)), where k = (γ − 1 − µ)/ν
If A is a saddle, then formulas (13) correspond to its separatrices.

(13a)

(13b)

230

F. Berezovskaya et al.
At point B, det(J) = µνx∗2y∗/(x∗ + y∗)2 > 0 if B is in the ﬁrst quadrant.
Therefore B is a topological node or a focus. The trace is tr(J) = −x∗ + (ν −
µ)(µ − γ )γ /µ2 and the point B is stable if tr(J) < 0 and unstable if tr(J) > 0. It
is easy to verify that both cases can occur in the model for appropriate parameter
values.
Deﬁne now the parametric boundary H: ν = µ(γ + µ/(µ − γ ))/(µ + γ ),
γ < µ < γ + 1 which intersects the boundary BO at point α (Fig. 1a). Then
tr(J) = 0 ⇔ B ∈ H.
The case tr(J) = 0 corresponds, in general, to the Andronov-Hopf bifurcation
at which the equilibrium point changes its stability with appearance/disappearance
of a limit cycle. The stability of this cycle is determined by the ﬁrst Lyapunov value
l1 (Arnold 1983). By calculating l1 with the computer package LOCBIF (Khibnik
et al. 1993), we showed that l1 is negative at H. So, we have obtained a proof of

Proposition 2. A supercritical Andronov-Hopf bifurcation of co-dimension 1
occurs in system (4) on the boundary H.

It follows from this Proposition that crossing H from left to right (for ﬁxed γ , ν)
implies a loss of stability of the equilibrium point B and the appearance of a stable
limit cycle in the phase plane (Fig. 1a, b).

4.4. Equilibrium points “at inﬁnity”

A complete investigation of the system includes the study of its limit properties at
inﬁnitely large values of the variables. We use Poincar´e coordinates and study the
system behavior in the Poincar´e sphere (see Appendix 3).

The result is the following:

Proposition 3. At the “end” of the x-axis (when x → ∞) the system (4) has the
equilibrium point E∞(z ≡ 1/x = 0, u ≡ y/x = 0) which is an unstable node for
all values of parameters (γ , µ, ν).

At the “end” of the y-axis (when y → ∞), the system (4) has the complicated
∞(z ≡ 1/y = 0, w ≡ x/y = 0). In the ﬁrst quadrant of the
equilibrium point E
plane (x, y) this point has only a saddle sector with separatrices z = 0 and w = 0
if parameter ν > 1, and has two sectors (a saddle sector with separatrix w = 0
and a stable node sector) if parameter 0 < ν < 1. The surface Inf: ν = 1 separates
these two cases in the parameter space (γ , µ, ν).

Complete phase portraits of the system (4) at “inﬁnity” are shown on Fig. 4a, b.

Remark. For values 0 < ν < 1, the equilibrium point B exists in the ﬁrst quadrant
(x, y) for all positive values of µ > γ .

5. On the limit cycles of the model

In Section 4.3, we have shown that for every ﬁxed γ a stable limit cycle appears
at the Andronov-Hopf bifurcation when crossing the parameter boundary H from

Fig. 4. System behavior “at inﬁnity” of the ﬁrst quadrant of the plane (x, y), shown on the
Poincar´e sphere. The point E∞ (the “end” of the x-axis) is an unstable node for all parameter
values, while the point E

saddle sector and a stable node sector if 0 < ν < 1.

the left to the right (see Fig. 1a, b). Such cycle has a small amplitude for parameter
values close to the boundary H; with a change of parameters the amplitude will
grow. For certain parameter values, this cycle was found by computation by Jost
et al. (1999). On the other hand, a limit cycle does not exist for parameter values
on the right of the boundary BO (because the system has no non-trivial equilibrium
points).

So, the parameter boundary on which the limit cycle disappears must be in the
“triangular” domain (Fig. 1a) made of the curve H, the upper part of BO and the
point α: ν = γ + 1 = µ of their intersection.

We have shown that the cycle appearing at the boundary H grows when the
parameter µ increases, whereas the separatrices of the equilibrium points A and O
approach each other. For some parameter values, the separatrices of points A and
O join in the heteroclinic contour named ao in Fig. 5b. This means that a non-local
heteroclinic bifurcation occurs in system (4). For these parameter values, the cycle
turns into the heteroclinic contour ao and disappears when the separatrices move
apart.

The heteroclinic contour ao is formed by the separatrix of the saddle A with
an asymptote given by formula (13b), by the separatrix of the complicated point
O with an asymptote given by formula (11), together with the equilibrium points
A and O and their common separatrix (13a): y = 0, 0 < x < 1. Trajectories
with parameter values near this non-local heteroclinic bifurcation are shown on
Fig. 5a, c.

Thus the limit cycle that appears at the local Andronov-Hopf bifurcation disap-
pears at the non-local heteroclinic bifurcation. Note that the amplitude and period
of the cycle grow with a change of parameters, in such way that the period tends to
inﬁnity when the cycle “tends” to the separatrix contour.
Parameter values for which the heteroclinic contour exists deﬁne the bifurcation
curve L in the plane (µ, ν) which intersects the line BO at the point α: ν = γ+1 = µ
(see Fig. 1a).

(b) “Biangular” heteroclinic contour ao formed by the points A and O together with their joint
separatrices; (a, c) the separatrices of the saddle point A and of the complicated equilibrium
point O interchange their positions relatively to each other.

The respective positioning of the boundaries H and L is shown on Fig. 1a and

is described by
Proposition 4. Let ν > γ +1. Varying the parameter µ, a stable limit cycle appears
for parameter values (γ ∗, ν∗, µH) corresponding to H, and disappears for values
(γ ∗, ν∗, µL) corresponding to L, µL > µH.

The proof of Proposition 4 follows directly from its formulation. The proof is
also based on Proposition 5. Accounting for structures of the equilibrium points of
∞), we
system (4) (including the structures of the inﬁnite equilibrium points E∞, E
show that the heteroclinic contour ao exists for some parameter values belonging
to the domain bounded by the line NN and the upper parts of line BA and curve
BO (Fig. 1a), for every ﬁxed value of parameter γ .

Then, we found numerically some parameter points on the bifurcation boundary

L which corresponds to the heteroclinic bifurcation occurring in system (4).

Finally, we analyze the stability of the limit cycle close to the mentioned contour,

using Dulac’s criterion (Dulac 1923). The following statement holds.
Proposition 5. A heteroclinic contour ao in the parameter domain γ + 1 < ν <
µ/(µ − γ ), γ < µ < γ + 1 formed by the equilibrium points O and A together
with their joint separatrices is stable.

A proof of this proposition is given in Appendix 2.
The most difﬁcult part in the investigation was the computation of the separatrix
of the complicated point O. It demands to use blow-up coordinates (x, u = y/x)
(see Appendix 1) in which the complicated equilibrium point O “splits” into two
non-degenerated saddles O1, K. The point A is a saddle too. The contour ao (see
Fig. 5b) is transformed into the “triangular” contour aok (see Fig. A2b) formed by
the separatrices of these three saddles. This heteroclinic contour corresponding to
the disappearance of the stable limit cycle was found for some parameter values
with help of the package TRAX (Levitin 1989).

Note that the mentioned heteroclinic bifurcation of system (4) has co-dimension
1 whereas, in general, such bifurcation has co-dimension 2 because it requires
enclosing two pairs of separatrices. In our case, however, one of the contour curves
is the trajectory y = 0 for 0 < x < 1, which exists for all parameter values due to
the model suppositions2. So, this bifurcation occurs on the boundary surface L in
the parameter space (γ , µ, ν) (see Fig. 1a).

Proposition 6. System (4) has no other limit cycles in the positive phase plane than
those described above.

The validity of this statement is obvious for parameter values on the right of
the boundary BO and on the left of the boundary BA (see Fig. 1a) because with
these parameter values the system has no nontrivial equilibria. The absence of
limit cycles was examined by careful numerical investigations in the parameter
domain ν < γ + 1 (located below the boundary NN in Fig. 1a) was proved by Jost
et al. (1999). Finally, numerical investigations of the system inside the parameter
domains bounded by BA, H and NN as well as L and BO have shown the absence
of cycles there.

6. The end of the theorem proof

The above analysis of system (4) contained in Lemmas 1–2 and Propositions 1–
6 gives the possibility to construct the (µ, ν)-portrait for a ﬁxed “typical” value
of parameter γ . This portrait consists of 12 parameter domains differing in the
topology of the corresponding phase portraits or in the asymptotes of characteristic
trajectories.

∞

Note that it follows from the structures of the point B and the “inﬁnity” points
E∞, E
(see Proposition 3 and the Remark in Section 4.4), that all main behaviors
of system (4) occur only in the ﬁnite part of the phase plane (x, y). This allows to
disregard rearrangements for inﬁnitely large values of the variables (x, y) concerned
with point E∞.
Note, additionally, that the three phase portraits which are possible for ν >
µ/(µ−γ ) in domain 1 (see Fig. A1) differ only in the asymptotes of the trajectories
and are identical topologically.

Therefore, the bifurcation portrait of system (4) has the form shown on Figs.

1a, 1b.

7. Interpretation of phase and parameter portraits

Let us give an ecological interpretation of the various behaviors of the ratio-
dependent predator–prey system (4), in response to changes of the following eco-
logical parameters: the consumption ability ν, the predator growing ability µ, and
the predator death rate γ . We shall essentially use the bifurcation diagram given
by Figs. 1a and 1b. It demonstrates eight types of system dynamics according to
values of ν and µ for a ﬁxed value of γ .

2 The same property is typical for many modiﬁcations of the Lotka-Volterra model (see

Bazykin 1985, 1998).

234

F. Berezovskaya et al.

The fundamental paradigm of theoretical ecology is that any “real” prey-predator
system can exist only with parameter values providing “stable regimes”, such as
steady states (Fig. 1b, portraits 2, 3, 4) or stable oscillations (Fig. 1b, portrait 5).
Changes of parameter values (caused by changes of environmental conditions or
other reasons) can lead the system into parametric domains where one or both pop-
ulations go extinct in different ways. Our analysis permits to describe completely
the parametric domains of stable coexistence and to predict what can occur if the
system gets out of these domains.
γ < µ < γ + 1 and µ > γ + 1 that correspond to distinct system behaviors.

There exist three main intervals of the predator growing ability µ: 0 < µ < γ ,

7.1. Small predator growing ability: 0 < µ < γ

Then, for any ν, the system belongs to domains 7 or 8 of the parameter portrait
(Fig. 1a). The respective phase portraits given in Fig. 1b exhibit extinction of the
predator population y in both domains 7 and 8 (because O(x∗ = 0, y∗ = 0),
A(x∗ = 1, y∗ = 0) are the only steady states). Predators are unable to reproduce
fast enough to compensate their death rate γ . Whatever the amount of prey con-
sumed, this food does not allow them to reproduce fast enough. Such predators are
“maladapted to the prey”.
Note an essential difference between domains 7 and 8. Within the domain 8
(ν < γ + 1), the consumption ability ν is low and as a result the prey population
survives. Within the domain 7 (ν > γ + 1), the consumption ability ν is high
enough that predators can drive both populations to extinction. This occurs only in
a given region of initial conditions (Fig. 1b, portrait 7).
7.2. Intermediate predator growing ability: γ < µ < γ + 1

∗ = 1 − ν(µ − γ )/µ, y

This corresponds to the domains 3, 4, 5, and 6. If the consumption ability is not very
large (domain 3: 0 < ν < γ + 1), then both prey and predator populations coexist
∗ = (µ − γ )(µ − ν(µ − γ ))/(µγ )).
at the steady state B(x
Here, the consumption ability and growing ability generate balanced dynamics
of both populations. Note that such behavior has also been described by several
predator–prey models incorporating the familiar logistic form of prey growth rate
and prey-dependent trophic functions like Lotka-Volterra or Holling functions (see,
e.g., Bazykin 1998, #3.3.1, #3.4.1).
The peculiarities of our model are revealed more clearly if predators are more
active (domains 4, 5, 6: ν > γ + 1). In domain 4 (Fig. 1a) populations reach either
coexistence or co-extinction depending on their initial conditions (Fig. 1b, portrait
4). Further, from domain 4, the system enters domain 5 with the growth of either
parameter ν or µ. The coexisting regime is now a stable limit cycle but, depending
on initial conditions, co-extinction can occur as in domain 5. With further growth
of parameters ν or µ, the system can enter domain 6 in which both populations go
extinct from any initial values.

Let us consider in more detail the peculiarities of system dynamics in domains
4 and 5. We have shown (Lemma 2) that “extinction trajectories” form a family of

Parametric analysis of the ratio-dependent predator–prey model

235

curves having the phase asymptotes (9). The separatrix of the complicated point O
has the asymptote (11).

Note ﬁrst that, for ﬁxed γ , µ, ν, a system with large initial abundances can
become extinct while the same system with low initial abundances can survive;
the result depends mainly on the ratio of prey and predator initial numbers. This
outcome follows from the “linearity” of the separatrix asymptote (11) for small
values of x, y and was conﬁrmed by numerous computer simulations for initial
values which were not small. Note further that, for ﬁxed µ < γ + 1, the exponent
of asymptotes (9) decreases when ν increases. This means that predators go extinct
faster than the prey, under growing consumption ability ν. The tangent K of sepa-
ratrix (11) decreases when either ν or µ increases. Thus, the area of initial values
for which populations reach coexistence becomes smaller. This area vanishes when
the parametric point (µ, ν) enters the parametric domain 6.

Thus, we have proved that the ratio-dependent model (4) demonstrates in the
domains 4, 5, and 6 of parameter space a unique behavior that distinguishes it
from standard prey-dependent predator–prey models (see Introduction). In these
domains, the origin O possesses its own basin of attraction. The existence of such
region of co-extinction was foreseen by Arditi and Ginzburg (1989) with the isocline
method, its ecological basis was discussed by Akc¸akaya et al. (1995) and it was
also proved by Jost et al. (1999).
7.3. High predator growing ability: µ > γ + 1

Two different situations are possible here (domains 1 and 2 in Fig. 1a).

Domain 1 corresponds to the condition ν > µ/(µ − γ ) and both populations
go to extinction from any initial abundance. The following interpretation can be
made. Due to the high consumption ability and the high predator growing ability
(compared with the death rate), the predator population increases so quickly that
all prey are consumed. Such predators are “overly efﬁcient.”

It is interesting that, under this condition, there exist two different types of
extinction trajectories (Fig. 1b, portrait 1). The ﬁrst one corresponds to the elliptic
sector (Fig. 3d): the trajectories approach the origin in both forward and reverse
time (t → ±∞). This means that for arbitrary small initial values of abundance,
both populations begin to grow for some time and after a certain period begin
to decrease and become extinct simultaneously. The other extinction trajectories
belong to a the region above the separatrix (13b) of point A possessing the asymptote
y = k(x − 1)(1 + o(1)), where k = (γ − 1 − µ)/ν. For these trajectories, the
number of prey decrease monotonically when t → ∞.

It is now possible to answer one of the ﬁrst arguments that was raised against
ratio dependence in predator–prey models. Under certain conditions, the model
can predict that both variables get “arbitrarily close to the axes” (Freedman and
Mathsen 1993), which was considered as “pathological” in a mathematical sense.
In biological terms this “pathological” dynamics means that both populations in-
crease initially, then predators consume all the prey and both populations go extinct.
This is quite a reasonable outcome for biologists, as it was demonstrated by Gause’s
experiments (see Akc¸akaya et al. 1995). It is easy to see that this dynamics corre-

236

F. Berezovskaya et al.

sponds exactly to the “elliptic” trajectories (Fig. 3d). Our analytical investigation
has proved that the elliptic sector is realized in the model with all parameter values
belonging to domain 1; the asymptotes of these trajectories are given by formulas
(9–11). Changes of the elliptic trajectories are caused by changes of the model
parameters.
Consider now domain 2, characterized by ν < µ/(µ − γ ). Here, prey and
predators coexist in a steady state for any initial numbers (Fig. 1b, portrait 2). So,
the threshold ν = µ/(µ − γ ) of the consumption ability is of a critical importance
for system coexistence.

Let’s now compare the system behavior characteristics in domain 2 with those
in the neighboring domain 3. In the phase portrait 2, a positive neighborhood of the
origin consists of two sectors: a “saddle” sector and an “unstable node” sector, which
are separated by the separatrix (11) (Fig. 3c). The node sector has trajectories with
asymptotes (10). These trajectories make both populations grow to the equilibrium
B(x∗ = 1− ν + νγ /µ, y∗ = (µ− γ )x∗/γ ). Note that with ν ≤ 1, the steady state
B exists for any arbitrarily large µ > γ . Note that for a ﬁxed consumption ability
ν, an increase of the growing ability µ leads to a decrease of x∗
together with an
increase of y∗
. So, for a ﬁxed ν, with parameter values belonging to domain 2, the
equilibrium x∗
is lower and the equilibrium y∗
is higher than the corresponding
numbers in domain 3.

With changes of parameters, the point (µ, ν) can move from domain 2 either to
domain 3 or to domain 1 (see Fig. 1a). In the ﬁrst case, crossing the boundary MM
does not change crucial qualitative characteristics of system behavior whereas, in
the second case, crossing the boundary BO results in extinction of both populations.
Finally, it is relevant to discuss one more peculiarity of the model. Usually, in
predator–prey models, the predator growing ability µ is assumed to be less than the
consumption ability ν. This follows from the supposition that the prey x is the only
food of the predators y. Remark that all above types of system behavior (except
domain 2) are realized for parameter values µ ≤ ν. However, the parametric domain
µ ≥ ν can be of interest as well. For example, this is the case when predators y feed
on other resources in such a way that the prey x is the limiting factor. According to
Liebig’s principle of limiting factors, the growing ability µ should be proportional
to min{aν, bρ}, where ρ is the consumption ability on other resources and a, b are
“stoechiometric factors” (Poletaev 1966). For such parameter values with µ ≥ ν,
the system must belong to domains 2, 3 or 1. In particular, the system can coexist
steadily under ν ≤ 1 with arbitrary large µ > γ .

8. Summarized conditions of coexistence and extinction

Populations of predators and prey reach a steady state of coexistence for any initial
densities in both domains 2 and 3 (Fig. 1). The difference in system dynamics is
revealed only for small values of predator numbers because the system is restored
more quickly in domain 2 than in domain 3. We can consider that the boundary
MM which divides these two domains is “soft” (meaning that no new steady states
or other attractors appear when crossing this boundary) and we can roughly pool
domains 2 and 3 into a common “area of unconditional population coexistence”.

Parametric analysis of the ratio-dependent predator–prey model

237

Depending on initial conditions, populations of predators and prey either coexist
or get extinct in both domains 4 and 5. This important characteristic of system
dynamics suggests to pool these two domains into a unique “area of conditional
population coexistence”, the difference being that in domain 4 the populations
coexist in a steady regime whereas in domain 5 they coexist on a limit cycle.
Again, the boundary H between the domains 4 and 5 is “soft”, since the system’s
behavior does not change in an essential way when crossing it.

Populations of predators and prey become extinct both in domain 6 (with os-
cillations) and in domain 1. So, the boundary between these domains, represented
by the upper part of curve BO in Fig. 1a, is “soft” too. We can pool domains 1 and
6 into an “area of unconditional population extinction”.

Thus, after pooling domains of Fig. 1a from the point of view of coexistence
or extinction of populations, we obtain the simpler diagram of Fig. 6. It contains
only ﬁve areas of parameters (γ , µ, ν), corresponding to qualitatively different
dynamics of the system.

– In Area I (union of domains 1 and 6), both populations go extinct for any initial

values.

– In Area II (union of domains 2 and 3), both populations coexist for any initial

values.

– In Area III (union of domains 4 and 5), populations reach either coexistence

or co-extinction depending on the initial values.

Fig. 6. Simpliﬁed parameter portrait regarding coexistence and extinction. Area I: both
populations go extinct for all initial values; Area II: both populations coexist for all initial
values; Area III: populations reach either coexistence or extinction depending on their initial
values; Areas IV and V: the predator population becomes extinct for all initial values, the
prey population always survives in Area IV, while it can become extinct for some initial
values in Area V. The parameter domain µ ≤ ν corresponds to a situation in which the prey
x are the only food of predators y. The parametric domain µ ≥ ν corresponds to the case in
which predators y also feed on other resources than the prey x, and in which x is a “limiting
factor” for the growth of y.

238

F. Berezovskaya et al.

– Area IV is identical to domain 8 and Area V is identical to domain 7. In both
cases, the predator population becomes extinct from all initial values. In Area
IV, the prey population always survives while in Area V, it can become extinct
for some initial values, in an analogous way to Areas II and III.

Area I has the boundary BO with Area II and the boundary L with Area III. Crossing
these boundaries into Area I leads to extinction of both populations. Areas II and IV
as well as Areas III and V have the common boundary BA. Crossing this boundary
from right to left leads to extinction of the predator population only. Note that Area
I has no common boundary with Areas IV and V. This means that a transition from
an area of predator extinction into an area of extinction of both populations is only
possible through an area of coexistence (Areas II or III).

In more biological terms, Areas IV and V correspond to predators that reproduce
very inefﬁciently, unable to survive even with plenty of prey (see phase portraits
8 and 7 in Fig. 1b). This normally leads the prey to reach its carrying capacity.
[An exception can occur in Area V, in the unusual case that the predators are very
efﬁcient consumers and very inefﬁcient reproducers: in this case the prey can be led
to extinction for unfavorable initial conditions.] With more efﬁciently reproducing
predators, the system enters Areas II and III (phase portraits 2, 3, 4, and 5 of Fig. 1b).
This permits coexistence unless (in Area III) the predators are “disproportionately”
efﬁcient consumers that can lead the prey to extinction if their initial values are
unfavorable. Finally, very efﬁcient predators (both in terms of consumption and
reproduction) place the system in Area I (see phase portraits 1 and 6 of Fig. 1b).
There, the predators always drive the prey to extinction and, consequently, become
extinct themselves.

As already explained in the Introduction, all these dynamic behaviors have been
observed in real populations but prey-dependent models are not able to produce
them all. Particularly, the ratio-dependent model is able to reproduce the fact that
extinction or coexistence can depend on the initial conditions (e.g., Huffaker 1958,
Luckinbill 1973). This occurs in Areas III and V.

From the perspective of biological control, for which prey (=pest) extinction is
desirable, Area I is the most interesting. In this case, both populations are driven to
extinction deterministically, an outcome that prey-dependent models are unable to
produce. If some stochasticity is considered for low abundance values, the extinction
can be accompanied by oscillations (see phase portrait 1 of Fig. 1b). Quite naturally,
this is obtained with efﬁcient predators (high values of ν and/or µ). Note that
in classical prey-dependent models, biological control is impossible to achieve
because efﬁcient predators lead to huge limit cycles (see Arditi and Berryman 1991).
From the perspective of biological conservation, for which coexistence is de-
sirable, Areas II and III are those that must be maintained. The boundaries of these
two areas can be considered “dangerous” because one or both populations become
extinct when crossing them. When they are approached, one can observe:

– an increase of the period of oscillations when approaching the boundary L

(in Area III),

– a decline of the prey steady state when approaching the boundary BO (in Area

II),

Parametric analysis of the ratio-dependent predator–prey model

239

– a decline of the predator steady state when approaching the boundary BA

(in Areas II or III).

If these phenomena are observed in biological populations, this can be interpreted
as signs that the system is approaching dangerous conditions. Assuming that the
endangered species is the predator, extinction can occur for two reasons: if the
growing ability µ declines for some reason (e.g., because of habitat fragmentation
leading to energy losses), the system can cross the boundary BA and enter Areas
IV or V. Conversely, if the predator becomes very efﬁcient at capturing food (e.g.,
because the prey becomes vulnerable) or if its growing ability increases (e.g., be-
cause of increased temperature), the system can enter the situation of biological
control (see above) and become extinct because of prey over-exploitation.

Appendix 1. Complicated equilibrium point O. Proof of Lemmas 1 and 2

System (4) is analytical in all points of the plane (x, y) except the origin. The
positioning of its phase trajectories in the ﬁrst quadrant is identical to those of the
polynomial system

xτ = x(1 − x)(x + y) − ν xy = x2 + (1 − ν)xy − x2(x + y)
yτ = −γ y(x + y) + µ xy = (µ − γ )xy − γ y2

obtained from (4) by a change of the independent variable:

dt = (x + y)dτ

(A.1)

(A.2)

System (A.1) has a complicated equilibrium point at the origin (because both eigen-
values are equal to zero) which is investigated below by methods developed in
[Berezovskaya 1976, 1995; Berezovskaya and Medvedeva 1994]. It follows from
these results that, if ν (cid:13)= µ/(µ − γ ), the homogeneous system

xτ = x2 + (1 − ν)xy
yτ = (µ − γ )xy − γ y2

(A.3)

is the main part of system (A.1) in a neighborhood of point O and provides also
the asymptotes of its characteristic trajectories. So, for describing the behavior of
system (A.1) in a neighborhood of the origin, we can integrate the homogeneous
system (A.3). However, as we are not only interested in a “small” neighborhood of
point O, we make a blow-up procedure for the complete system (A.2).

The ﬁrst step consists in a change of variables in system (A.1) [see also Jost

et al. 1999]:

x = x, u = y/x

dτ = x2 ds

(A.4)

that transforms in a non-degenerate way the ﬁrst quadrant of the (x, y)-plane, except
x = 0, into the ﬁrst quadrant of the (x, u)-plane and blows-up the point O into the
u-axis.

240

F. Berezovskaya et al.

We obtain the system

xs = x(1 + (1 − ν)u − x(1 + u))
us = −(γ + 1 − ν)u2 + (µ − γ − 1)u + ux(1 + u)

(A.5)
which has two equilibrium points on the u-axis: O1(0, 0) and K(0, k) with k =
(µ − γ − 1)/(γ + 1 − ν). The eigenvalues of these points are:

O1: λ1(O1) = 1, λ2(O1) = µ − γ − 1,

K: λ1(K) = −(µ − γ − 1), λ2(K) = (µ − ν(µ − γ ))/(γ + 1 − ν)

(A.6)
So, both points are non-degenerate if (γ + 1− ν)(µ− γ − 1)(µ− ν(µ− γ )) (cid:13)= 0.
Depending on the parameters γ , µ, ν the following cases are realized in the system
(A.5) in the ﬁrst quadrant of the (x, u)-plane (Fig. A1):
(1) single saddle O1 if µ < γ + 1 and ν < γ + 1;
(2) single unstable node O1 if µ > γ + 1 and ν > γ + 1;
(3) saddle O1 and saddle K if γ < µ < γ + 1 and γ + 1 < ν < µ/(µ − γ ) or if
(4) saddle O1 and unstable node K if µ < γ + 1 and ν > µ/(µ − γ );
(5) unstable node O1 and saddle K if µ > γ + 1 and ν < µ/(µ − γ );
(6) unstable node O1 and stable node K if µ > γ +1 and µ/(µ− γ ) < ν < γ +1.
We now repeat the blow-up procedure to study the behavior of the system close

µ < γ and ν > γ + 1;

to the y-axes:

y = y, w = x/y

(A.7)
This transformation is non-degenerate for all values of x, y except y = 0 and the
point O blows-up into the w-axes. In variables (w, y) we obtain the system

dτ = y2 ds

ws = (γ + 1 − µ)w2 + (γ + 1 − ν)w − yw2(w + 1)
ys = y(−γ + (µ − γ )w)
which has on the w-axis the equilibria O

Assembling together the obtained results and returning to the initial variables

of characteristic trajectories. They should be pooled together in the “uniﬁed” phase
portrait. Therefore, there are only four topologically different structures in the plane
(x, y) in non-degenerate cases; they are presented in Fig. 3.
At the parameter boundary MM: µ = γ + 1, ν < γ + 1, system (A.5) has
the saddle-node O1 with a repelling node sector; at the parameter boundary NN:
ν = γ + 1, µ < γ + 1 system (A.8) has the saddle-node O
∗
1 with an attracting node
sector. In both cases, only the saddle sector is situated in the positive quadrant.
At the parameter boundary BO: ν = µ/(µ − γ ) the point O has an elliptic
sector in its positive neighborhood. Note that the study of the case corresponding
to this boundary has demanded to repeat the blow-up procedure for the point K of
system (A.5) (or point K

of system (A.8)).

∗

Proof of Lemma 1 is now complete.
The above analysis gives the possibility to show the asymptotes of trajectories

which tend to point O and, thereby, prove Lemma 2.
Point O1 of system (A.5) can only be an unstable one. If it is an unstable node
(µ > γ + 1), then in the plane (x, u)O1 is the source of a family of trajectories
with asymptotes

u = Cxµ−γ−1(1 + o(1)) (where C is an arbitrary constant).

In coordinates (x, y) this family is transformed into Family 2 (see Section 4.2).

242

If point O

F. Berezovskaya et al.

1 is a stable node of system (A.8) (for ν > γ + 1), it is reached in the
∗

plane (w, y) by a family of trajectories with asymptotes

w = Cy(γ /(ν−1))−1(1 + o(1)) (where C is arbitrary constant).

In coordinates (x, y) this family is transformed into Family 1 (see Section 4.2).

Finally, point K(k, 0) with k = (µ − γ − 1)/(γ + 1 − ν) in system (A.5) can
have different topological type depending on parameters: a saddle, a stable or an
unstable node.
If K is a saddle (for 0 < µ < γ + 1 and γ + 1 < ν < µ/(µ− γ ) or µ > γ + 1
and ν < γ + 1), then the curve u = k(1 + o(1)) is the asymptote of the separatrix.
Therefore the curve

s: y = kx(1 + o(1))

is a separatrix of the saddle sector of point O in the plane (x, y).

If K is a stable/unstable node, then a set of trajectories which lie in an attract-
ing/repelling sector in a positive neighborhood of point O, have the same asymptote
with a positive value of k (see Fig. A2).

This completes the investigation of point O in cases of non-degeneracy.
If µ = γ + 1, ν (cid:13)= γ + 1, then point O1 of system (A.5) is a saddle-node; its
characteristic trajectories have asymptotes that can be easily obtained by integrating
system (A.5) in a neighborhood of point O1. In coordinates (x, y), we obtain the
family of trajectories:

y = (γ + 1 − ν)x/ ln(Cx) (1 + o(1)).

We can treat analogously the point O
In coordinates (x, y) we obtain the family of trajectories:

1 of system (A.8) with ν = γ + 1, µ (cid:13)= γ + 1.
∗

x = (γ /(µ − γ − 1)y ln(Cy) (1 + o(1)),

C being an arbitrary constant in both cases.

Finally, if ν = γ + 1 = µ then system (A.8) can be reduced to the equation:

dw/dy = w2(w + 1)/(γ − w).

The integral of this equation in variables (x, y) has the form given by formula (5).
Note that the point O possesses an elliptic sector in the ﬁrst quadrant of the plane
(x, y).

Appendix 2. Stability of the heteroclinic cycle. Proof of Proposition 5

The cycle considered appears from the contour ao formed by the separatrices of
the saddle point A and the complicated equilibrium O of system (A.1); it contains
the point B inside itself (see Fig. 5b).
In the parameter domain γ + 1 < ν < µ/(µ − γ ), γ < µ < γ + 1, the
blow-up (A4) “splits” point O into the saddles O1(0, 0) and K(0, k) with k =

Finding the parameter values for which separatrices coincide is a problem that
can be solved, in general, only by computation. On the contrary, the stability of
the cycle that appears by heteroclinic bifurcation can be estimated with help of a
simple local condition, namely by the ratio of the eigenvalues of the system at the
saddles forming the contour, and given by Dulac criterion (Dulac 1923)3.

We use this criterion to prove stability of the heteroclinic contour aok of system
(A.5) in the plane (x, u). After this, returning to the variables (x, y), we obtain that
the heteroclinic contour ao of system (4) is stable (see Figs. 2a and 5).
It is easy to calculate from the Jacobian of system (A.5) (see Eqs. A.6) that in
the considered parameter domain the positive (λ+) and negative (λ−) eigenvalues
are of the form:

λ+(O1) = 1, λ−(O1) = µ − γ − 1;
λ+(K) = −(µ − γ − 1), λ−(K) = (µ − ν(µ − γ ))/(γ + 1 − ν) < γ + 1;
λ+(A) = (µ − γ ), λ−(A) = −1.

The value

S = (cid:1)

(cid:1)λ+(O1)λ+(K)λ+(A)/(λ−(O1)λ−(K)λ−(A))

(cid:1)

(cid:1) − 1 < 0

Therefore, the heteroclinic cycle of system (A.5) must be stable. Returning to
system (4), we obtain that a cycle close to the contour ao should be stable.

3 Let λ+(O1), λ+(O2), . . . , λ+(On) be
and λ−(O1),
λ−(O2), . . . , λ−(On) the negative eigenvalues of n non-degenerate saddles O1, O2, . . . , On,
whose separatrices compose the heteroclinic contour. A cycle that appears from this contour
is stable if the value S = |λ+(O1)λ+(O2) . . . λ+(On)/λ−(O1)λ−(O2) . . . λ−(On)| −1 < 0
and unstable if S > 0.

Appendix 3. Analysis of system behavior “at inﬁnity”
Let us, at ﬁrst, study system (4) in the case x → ∞.
The Poincar´e map

x = 1/z, y = u/z

applied to system (A.1), which is equivalent to system (4), leads to the system:

zt = (1 + u − z − (1 − ν)uz)/z
ut = u(u + 1 + (µ − γ − 1)z − (γ + 1 − ν)uz)/z2

By a standard change of the independent variable dτ = dt /z2, this system is
transformed to the equivalent form:

zτ = z(1 + u − z − (1 − ν)uz)
uτ = u(u + 1 + (µ − γ − 1)z − (γ + 1 − ν)uz)

(A.10)
It is easy to see that system (A.10) has the equilibrium point E∞(z = 0, u = 0)
which is an unstable node for all values of parameters (γ , µ, ν).
An analogous procedure is applied to system (4) for the case y → ∞. Changing

the variables

y = 1/z, x = w/z

together with a change of the independent variable dτ = dt /z2 applied to system
(A.1) leads to the system:

zτ = z2(γ − (µ − γ )w)
wτ = −w2(w + 1) + (1 − ν + γ )zw + (1 + γ − µ)zw2

(A.11)
System (A.11) has the complicated equilibrium point E∞(z = 0, w = 0). The
analysis of this point by the above-mentioned blow-up method gives the following
result.
The complicated point E∞ in the ﬁrst quadrant has only one saddle sector with
separatrices z = 0, w = 0 if ν > 1 and has two sectors, a saddle and a stable-node,
if 0 < ν < 1.

Complete phase portraits of system (4) “at inﬁnity” are shown in Fig. 4a, b.

Appendix 4. On the reduction of model (1)

In the paper by Jost et al. (1999), the model (1) was reduced with the changes

N = A1x1, P = B1y1, t = C1τ1,
(A.12)
with A1 = eK/(αh), B1 = e2K/(αh), C1 = h/e, setting the parameters to
R = rh/e, D = αh/e and Q = qh/e, and got the form:

dx1/dτ1 = Rx1(1 − x1/D) − Dx1y1/(y1 + Dx1)
dy1/dτ1 = Dx1y1/(y1 + Dx1) − Qy1

(A.13)

Parametric analysis of the ratio-dependent predator–prey model

245

In Section 2, model (1) was reduced with different changes of variables and param-
eters (2–4). It is easy to see the correspondences between parameters and variables
of (A.13) and those of (2–4):

x/x1 = 1/D = µ/ν, y/y1 = 1/D2 = (µ/ν)2, τ/τ1 = R = 1/µ;

µ = 1/R, ν = µD = D/R, γ = Q/R.

So, both forms (A.13) and (4) of model (1) are equivalent mathematically if pa-
rameters are nonzero. This gives the possibility to use results obtained by Jost et al.
(1999). For example, it was proved by calculation there that limit cycles are absent
under the condition: D < Q + R ⇔ ν < γ + 1 for µ (cid:13)= 0.
