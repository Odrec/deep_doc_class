Abstract

Extreme response style (ERS) and acquiescence response style (ARS) are
among the most encountered problems in attitudinal research. The authors
investigate whether the response bias caused by these response styles varies
with following three aspects of question format: full versus end labeling,
numbering answer categories, and bipolar versus agreement response scales.
A questionnaire was distributed to a random sample of 5,351 respondents
from the Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences household
panel, of which a subsample was assigned to one of five conditions. The
authors apply a latent class factor model that allows for diagnosing and cor-
recting for ERS and ARS simultaneously. The results show clearly that both
response styles are present in the data set, but ARS is less pronounced than
ERS. With regard to format effects, the authors find that end labeling evokes
more ERS than full labeling and that bipolar scales evoke more ERS than
