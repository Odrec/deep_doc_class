Introduction to English Law – Reading List

For this class, you need to begin by reading a general introduction to Tort law. There are 
plenty of relevant books in the ELSI library; I have just given you a couple of examples of 
appropriate texts to read for introductory chapters. Just choose any book on tort law (there are 
a lot in the ELSI library) and read the introductory chapter(s). The chapters that I have listed 
below are all very short.

You then need to read about the core elements of a ‘duty of care’, ‘causation, and 
‘remoteness’. Any Tort textbook should be able to provide you with a background on these – 
just look up the relevant chapters in the contents page (they will probably be under the 
heading of ‘Negligence’). Again, there are plenty of relevant books in the ELSI library; I have 
just given you a couple of examples of appropriate texts to read for introductory chapters. The 
chapters that I have listed below are all very short.

Ensure that you focus on the cases covered in class (and noted for you on the slides). The 
cases that are starred (*) on the slides are essential – you must know these cases.
