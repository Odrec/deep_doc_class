DEFINITIONS 

Theatre of cruelty 

A term introduced by the French actor Antonin Artaud in a series of manifestos in the 1930s, 
collected  as  Le  Théâtre  et  son  double  (1938).  It  refers  to  his  projected  revolution  in  drama, 
whereby  the  rational  ‘theatre  of  psychology’  was  to  be  replaced  by  a  more  physical  and 
primitive rite intended to shock the audience into an awareness of life's cruelty and violence. 
The  idea,  derived  partly  from  Surrealism,  was  that  the  audience  should  undergo  a  catharsis 
through  being  possessed  by  a  ‘plague’  or  epidemic  of  irrational  responses.  Artaud’s  own 
attempts to put this theory into dramatic practice failed, and he was locked up for some time 
as  a  lunatic.  Some  later  dramatists,  though,  have  developed  these  principles  more 
successfully:  a  celebrated  instance  was  Peter  Brook's  production  in  1964  of  Peter  Weiss's 
Marat/Sade. (“Theatre of cruelty”)  
 
Black Revolutionary Theatre 

The Black Revolutionary Theatre represents an attempt to racialize the Artaudian “theatre of 
cruelty” by instigating its audience to act in revolutionary and violent ways to overthrow the 
white-dominated American social order. (Piggford 75) 

 

QUOTES 

Racism 

LULA.  I  was.  But  only  after  I’d  turned  around  and  saw  you  staring  through  that  window 
down in the vicinity of my ass and legs. (p. 7) 

LULA. You look like you been trying to grow a beard. That’s exactly how you look like. You 
look  like  you  live  in  New  Jersey  with  your  parents  and  are  trying  to  grow  a  beard.  That’s 
what. You look like you’ve been reading Chinese poetry and drinking lukewarm sugarless tea. 
[Laughs, uncrossing and recrossing her legs] You look like death eating a soda cracker. (p. 8) 

LULA. You tried to make it with your sister when you were ten. […] But I succeeded a few 
weeks ago. (p. 9) 

LULA. I told you I didn’t know anything about you … you’re a well-known type. (p. 11) 

LULA. I bet your name is… something like… uh, Gerald or Walter. Huh? 

CLAY. God, no. 

LULA.  Lloyd,  Norman?  One  of  those  helpless  colored  names  creeping  out  New  Jersey. 
Leonard? Gag…. (p. 15)  

LULA. Everything you say is wrong. [Mock smile] That’s what makes you so attractive. Ha. 
In  that  funnybook  jacket  with  all  the  buttons.  [More  animate,  taking  hold  of  his  jacket] 
What’ve you got that jacket and tie on in all this heat for? And why’re you wearing a jacket 
and tie like that? Did your people ever burn witches or start revolutions over the price of tea? 
Boy, those narrow-shoulder clothes come from a tradition you ought to feel oppressed by. A 
three-button  suit.  What  right  do  you  have  to  be  wearing  a  three-button  suit  and  striped  tie? 
Your grandfather was a slave, he didn’t go to Harvard. (p. 18) 

LULA. Boy, are you corny. I take back what I said before. Everything you say is not wrong. 
It’s perfect. You should be on television. (p. 19) 

LULA. May the people accept you as a ghost of the future. And love you, that you might not 
kill them when you can.  

CLAY. What? 

LULA.  You’re  a  murderer,  Clay,  and  you  know  it.  [Her  voice  darkening  with  significance] 
You know goddamn well what I mean. (p. 21) 

LULA. And we’ll pretend the people cannot see you. […] And that you are free of your own 
history. (p. 21)  

LULA. Oh yeah. About them more that I know about you. Do they frighten you? 

CLAY. Frighten me? Why should they frighten me?  

LULA. ’Cause you’re an escaped nigger. 

CLAY. Yeah? 

LULA. ’Cause you crawled through the wire and made tracks to my side. (p. 29) 

LULA.  […]  Ten  little  niggers  sitting  on  a  limb,  but  none  of  them  ever  looked  like  him. 
[Pointing to CLAY […]] (p. 30) 

LULA. Come on, Clay… let’s do the thing, Uhh! Uhh! Clay! Clay! You middle-class black 
bastard. Forget your social-working mother for a few seconds and let’s knock stomachs. Clay, 
you liver-lipped white man. You would-be Christian. You ain’t no nigger, you’re just a dirty 
white man. Get up, Clay. Dance with me, Clay. (p. 31) 

LULA. […] jackets buttoning up to your chin, so full of white man’s words. Christ. God. Get 
up  and  scream  at  these  people.  Like  scream  meaningless  shit  in  these  hopeless  faces.  […] 
Clay, you got to break out. Don’t sit there dying the way they want you to die. […] (p. 31) 

LULA.  […]  Screw  yourself,  Uncle  Tom…  I  mean,  Uncle  Thomas  Woolly-Head.  With  old 
white matted name. He hobbles on his wooden cane. Old Tom. Old Tom. Let the white man 

hump  his  ol’ mama, and he jes’ shuffle off in  the woods and hide his  gentle gray head. Ol’ 
Thomas Woolly-Head. (p. 32)  

LULA. You’re afraid of white people. And your father was. Uncle Tom Big Lip! (p. 33) 

 

Representations of Racism 

LULA. […] I lie a lot. [Smiling] It helps me control the world. (p. 9) 

CLAY. […] You know Warren Enright? (p. 9) 

CLAY. […] You’re a friend of Georgia’s? (p. 9) 

LULA. I told you I lie. I don’t know your sister. I don’t know Warren Enright. (p. 10) 

CLAY. Whatta you, a lady wrestler or something? (p. 12) 

LULA. My hair is turning gray. A gray hair for each year and type I’ve come through. (p. 13) 

LULA. I’m Lena the Hyena. (p. 14) 

CLAY. You act like you’re on television already.  

LULA. That’s because I’m an actress. 

CLAY. I thought so. 

LULA. Well, you’re wrong. I’m no actress.  I told you I  always lie. I’m nothing, honey, and 
don’t you ever forget it. [Lighter] Although my mother was a Communist. The only person in 
my family ever to amount to anything. (p. 19) 

CLAY. You live in a tenement?  

LULA. Wouldn’t live anywhere else. Reminds me specifically of my novel form of insanity. 
(p. 24) 

LULA. […] Apples and long walks with deathless intelligent lovers. (p. 28) 

[…] Lula embodies […] th[e] anxiety of castration […]. (Rebhorn 804) 

With  her  constant  manipulation  of  language  and  action  […],  Lula  appears  more  like  a 
playwright than an actress. She scripts the actual lines Clay must say [.] (Rebhorn 806) 

[…]  [This]  relates  her  directly  to  Baraka  himself,  for  as  a  playwright,  he,  like  Lula,  scripts 
Clay’s words. (Rebhorn 806) 

We can read the apples Lula speaks of at the beginning of the play as symbols of temptation, 
for  she  is  tempting  Clay  throughout  to  break  through  the  shell  of  his  “Uncle  Tom”  persona 
and  embrace  a  dynamic  idea  of  black  masculinity,  a  black  masculinity  that  will  necessarily 
find its voice by defiantly opposing Lula’s white femininity. (Rebhorn 809)  

Lula  functions  […]  as  both  Clay’s  mother  and  his  demonic  psychotherapist  by  bringing 
Clay’s repressed desires to the surface and his consciousness. (Piggford 76) 

[…] Lula… control[s] the situation. She picks Clay up. She encourages him. And it is she who 
goads  him  into  revealing  things  which  must  have  been  carefully  hidden  deep  in  the  most 
secret places of his heart. (Piggford 77) 

[…]  Lula  was  a  hidden  aspect  of  Clay’s  own  “black  skull,”  an  intrinsic  part  of  Clay’s  own 
psyche. (Piggford 80) 

[…] Lula […] represents herself as being, an indeterminate creature for whom being is a form 
of game playing. (Kumar 276) 

Lula, represent[s] the self-assured and provocative new woman of the sixties […].  (Achilles 
223-224) 

[…] Lula, who keeps feeding apples to Clay, [is associated] with Eve. (Achilles 227) 

[…] Lula [represents] “White America” […]. (Achilles 228) 

[…]  Lula  represents  Baraka’s  own  later  deconstruction  of  his  background:  “Lula  is  perhaps 
everything Clay does not permit himself to become” […]. (Achilles 228) 

 

Dutchman and the subway car 

In the flying underbelly of the city. Steaming heat, and summer on top, outside. Underground. 
The  subway  heaped  in  modern  myth.  […]  Dim lights  and  darkness  whistling  by  against  the 
glass. […] But give the sense of speed. Also stations, whether the train stopped or the glitter 
and activity of these stations merely flashes by the windows. (p. 3)  

A dutchman, “the theatrical term meaning a strip of cloth used to hid[e] the crack between the 
seams of flats, or, in a more general sense, a contrivance used to hide a defect of some kind 
[…]. (Piggford 76)  

[…] Clay’s innermost “defect […]” [is] the secret buried in his unconscious mind. (Piggford 
77)  

The  title  Dutchman  can  be  understood  […]  as  a  metaphor  for  “the  meretricious  façade  of 
civility” […] utilized by Clay both in his dress and his language to hide his murderous inner 
desires. (Piggford 77) 

[…]  [T]he  subway  train  [is  associated]  with  the  Flying  Dutchman  and  Dutch  slave  traders, 
which brought Africans to America to be exploited […]. (Achilles 228)  

A violent act on a subway car […] no matter who it involves, where is actually occurs, or how 
unusual the circumstances, seems equally possible under any other set of circumstances, too. 
(Luter 29) 

Therein  lies one reason the violence in  Dutchman is  so chilling for audiences both  then and 
now:  that  train  could  be  anywhere,  and  its  space  is  open  to  all,  no  matter  that  the  action  is 
literally beneath the surface, dramatizing those tensions that similarly lie beneath the surface 
of  American  race  relations  […].  Even  worse,  there  was  no  plan  for  dealing  with  subway 
violence in 1964, the year of Dutchman’s premiere. (Luter 30) 

[T]he New York subway circa 1964 is a place both familiar and novel. (Luter 30) 

[T]he underground space [is] […] a place of refuge. (Luter 31) 

The sense of imprisonment on a path not of one’s own making and the conflict between the 
will of the individual and the community […] help cause the tensions […]. (Luter 35) 

[N]o  matter  how  vehemently  Clay  resists  Lula’s  teases  and  asserts  his  own  selfhood  and 
blackness, the play’s considerable tensions seem to require everything to boil over in violent 
conflict. Just as subway lines can end only at predetermined terminals, the plot of Dutchman 
can only end with spilled blood. (Luter 33) 

[…] [T]he subway passengers of the second scene [represent] “The Silent Majority” and the 
subway itself “The Course of History […]. (Achilles 228) 

 

Literature and art 

CLAY. Well, in college I thought I was Baudelaire. But I’ve slowed down since.  

LULA. […] A black Baudelaire. (p. 19) 

LULA.  And  you’ll  call  my  rooms  black  as  a  grave.  You’ll  say,  “This  place  is  like  Juliet’s 
tomb.” (p. 26) 

For Clay, art replaces violence and vice versa since black artists have so sublimated their rage 
at white institutions. (Luter 27)  

[Clay] argues that his  own poetry and the music of black musicians is compensation for the 
urge  to  kill.  If  black  artists  did  not  produce  art,  they  would  murder  white  people.  Or, 
conversely,  if  these  black  artists  murdered  white  people,  they  would  not  need  their  art. 
(Achilles 225) 

 

Assimilation 

CLAY.  Shit,  you  don’t  have  any  sense,  Lula,  nor  feeling  either.  I  could  murder  you  know. 
Such a tiny ugly throat. I could squeeze it flat, and watch you turn blue, on a humble. For dull 
kicks. And all these weak-faced ofays squatting around here, staring over their papers at me. 
Murder them, too. Even if they expected it. That man there… [Points to a well-dressed man] I 
could rip that Times right out of his hand, as skinny and middle-classed as I am,  I could rip 

that  paper  out  of  his  hand  and  just  as  easily  rip  out  his  throat.  It  makes  no  great  effort.  For 
what? To kill you soft idiots? You don’t understand anything but luxury. (p. 33) 

CLAY. […] Don’t tell me anything! If I’m a middle-class fake white man… let me be. And 
let me be in the way I want. […] Uncle Tom. Thomas. Whoever. It’s none of your business. 
You  don’t  know  anything  except  what’s  there  for  you  to  see.  […]  Not  the  pure  heart,  the 
pumping  black  heart.  […]  You  fuck  some  black  man,  and  right  away  you’re  an  expert  on 
black people. […] You wanted to do the belly rub? Shit, you don’t even know how. […] Belly 
rub  hates  you.  […]  And  the  only  thing  that  would  cure  the  neurosis  would  be  your  murder. 
Simple as that. I mean if I murdered you, then other white people would begin to understand 
me. You understand? No. I guess not. […] Murder. Just murder! Would make us all sane. […] 
My people’s madness.  Hah! That’s a laugh. My  people. They don’t need me to  claim them. 
They got legs and arms of their own. (p. 33-34)  

[…] Clay represents “Assimilationist Black America” […]. (Achilles 228) 

[…]  Clay’s  own  desire  to  remain  an  “Uncle  Tom”  […]  forecloses  the  possibility  of  his 
becoming an actual murderer […]. (Piggford 78) 

[…] Lula mocks Clay and accuses him of being an Uncle Tom… whereas Clay would like to 
see  himself  as  a  black  revolutionary.  The  truth,  however,  is  that  he  is  neither  one  nor  the 
other, and, hence, feels a real lack of identity […]. (Piggford 78) 

[…] [S]ome critics have viewed Clay’s speech as a failed attempt at individuated resistance to 
the totalizing current of a hegemonic white society. (Luter 34) 

[…] Dutchman […] is, as Baraka claimed in 1964, “about the difficulty of becoming a man in 
America”. (Luter 34) 

[…] Clay oversteps the boundaries allowed for black self-expression in white society, even as 
the white majority may be aware of repressed black rage. (Luter 34) 

[…] Clay as a middle-class black intellectual incorporates Baraka’s rejected New Jersey roots 
[…]. (Achilles 228) 

 

Death 

CLAY.  [Bending  across  the  girl  to  retrieve  his  belongings]  Sorry,  baby,  I  don’t  think  we 
could make it. [As he is bending over her, the girl brings up a small knife and plunges it into 
CLAY’s chest. Twice. He slumps across her knees, his mouth working stupidly] 

LULA. Sorry is right. [Turning to the others in the car who have already gotten up from their 
seats] Sorry is the rightest thing  you’ve said. Get this man off me! Hurry, now! [The others 
come  and  drag  CLAY’s  body  down  the  aisle]  Open  the  door  and  throw  his  body  out.  [They 
throw him off] And all of you get off at the next stop.  [LULA busies herself straightening her 
things.  Getting  everything  in  order.  She  takes  out  a  notebook  and  makes  a  quick  scribbling 

note.  Drops  it  in  her  bag.  The  train  apparently  stops  and  all  the  others  get  off,  leaving  her 
alone in the coach. […] ] (p. 37) 

[…]  Clay  in  Dutchman  […]  winds  up  murdered  for  asserting  what  is  […]  irrefutable  truth. 
(Luter 31) 

[…] Clay winds up killed not just for speaking the truth […], but for racializing the allegedly 
ahistorical, democratic space of the subway, which […] represents New York and potentially 
the United States as a whole. (Luter 34) 

Clay asserts his own masculinity as superior to Lula’s femininity with his apology, but at just 
this  moment,  when  Clay  refuses  Lula’s  sexuality  and  makes  the  clearest  assertion  of  his 
masculinity,  Lula  “plunges”  a  knife  into  his  chest  as  he  is  bending  over  her-  the  ultimate 
castration metaphor […]. (Rebhorn 805) 

Clay, characterized primarily by his repressed desire to rape and murder whites, is martyred 
for the black revolutionary cause. (Piggford 76) 

 [I]n Dutchman “Baraka both diagnoses the problem in American society – white dominance 
– and prescribes his cure: race revolution and murder” […]. (Kumar 274) 

Dutchman […] examines the “skull” of a repressed middle-class black in order to expose the 
horror of his  daily life,  his  personal  hell as it were.  It  also  functions as  a warning  – both  to 
“heretical”  blacks  like  Clay  who  help  support  the  nightmare  of  black  oppression  through 
inaction and to whites – that the revolution is coming. (Piggford 82) 

Dutchman  is  not  […]  an  embodiment  of,  “blackness,”  but  is  rather  an  exploration  of  the 
carious  strategies  of  representation  of  black  identity  and  the  possibility  of  unraveling  these. 
(Kumar 274)
