Fig. 4. PPI of the right
ACC. (A) All areas are
shown that receive a sig-
niﬁcant context-depen-
dent contribution from
right ACC during visuo-
spatial decisions, pro-
jected on the same ren-
dered brain as in Fig. 1.
Right ACC signiﬁcantly
increased its inﬂuence
on posterior (28/–72/48,

corrected) and anterior
parts of the right IPS
⫽
(42/–42/44,
4.63, P ⬍ 0.034, correct-
ed) during visuospatial decisions. Note the speciﬁcity of this result: Even when the threshold was
reduced to P ⬍ 0.05, uncorrected, no other signiﬁcant clusters were found throughout the brain.
(B) This schema summarizes the negative ﬁndings for right ACC: As indicated by the gray dashed
lines, right ACC shows no context-dependent contributions to any left-hemispheric area during
visuospatial decisions and none to any left- or right-hemispheric area at all during letter decisions.

tivity (25) that investigated two tasks with right
hemisphere dominance demonstrated top-down
effects that were specific for the right hemi-
sphere, i.e., from the right middle frontal gyrus
(area 46) on right extrastriate areas. It is thus
likely that our findings generalize to other later-
alized tasks. Although we cannot exclude later-
alization contingent on stimulus type in some
situations, our results are consistent with previ-
ous findings from split-brain patient studies (7)
and positron emission tomography (11) showing
hemispheric specialization based on task de-
mands. Research on hemispheric specialization
should move beyond analyses of asymmetric
regional activations and focus more strongly on
functional
interactions within and between
hemispheres.

Inﬂuence of Life Stress on

Depression: Moderation by a

Polymorphism in the 5-HTT Gene

In a prospective-longitudinal study of a representative birth cohort, we tested
why stressful experiences lead to depression in some people but not in others.
A functional polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter
(5-HT T) gene was found to moderate the inﬂuence of stressful life events on
depression. Individuals with one or two copies of the short allele of the 5-HT T
promoter polymorphism exhibited more depressive symptoms, diagnosable
depression, and suicidality in relation to stressful life events than individuals
homozygous for the long allele. This epidemiological study thus provides ev-
idence of a gene-by-environment interaction, in which an individual’s response
to environmental insults is moderated by his or her genetic makeup.

Depression is among the top five leading causes
of disability and disease burden throughout the
world (1). Across the life span, stressful life
events that involve threat, loss, humiliation, or
defeat influence the onset and course of depres-

sion (2–5). However, not all people who en-
counter a stressful life experience succumb to
its depressogenic effect. Diathesis-stress theo-
ries of depression predict that individuals’ sen-
sitivity to stressful events depends on their ge-
netic makeup (6, 7). Behavioral genetics re-
search supports this prediction, documenting
that the risk of depression after a stressful event
is elevated among people who are at high ge-
netic risk and diminished among those at low
genetic risk (8). However, whether specific
genes exacerbate or buffer the effect of stressful
life events on depression is unknown. In this
study, a functional polymorphism in the pro-
