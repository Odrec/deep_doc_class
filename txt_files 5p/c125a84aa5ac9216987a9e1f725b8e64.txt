Husband and wife Ñ Financial relief Ñ Transfer of property Ñ Properties held by
companies controlled by husband Ñ Wife alleging that properties belonging
beneÞcially to husband Ñ Husband and companies failing to comply with orders
for disclosure Ñ Husband ordered to transfer properties to wife or to cause them
to be so transferred Ñ Whether property to which husband ÔÔentitledÕÕ Ñ
Whether conditions for piercing companiesÕ corporate veils established Ñ
Whether court entitled to draw adverse inferences as to beneÞcial ownership of
properties Ñ Whether jurisdiction to order husband to transfer properties held
by companies to wife Ñ Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 (c 18), s 24(1)(a)

The wife issued a claim for ancillary relief under section 23 of the Matrimonial
Causes Act 19731 against her husband, who was the sole owner of a number of
complexly structured o›shore companies. The wife alleged that the husband had
used the companies to hold legal title to properties which belonged beneÞcially to
him. However, the husband failed to comply with orders for the full and frank
disclosure of his Þnancial position and the companies, which were joined as parties to
the proceedings, failed to Þle a defence or to comply with orders for disclosure. The
judge rejected the wifeÕs submission that the husband had been guilty of any
impropriety in relation to the companies such as would ordinarily entitle the court to
pierce the corporate veil, but held that, in matrimonial proceedings for ancillary relief,
section 24(1)(a) of the 1973 Act conferred a wider jurisdiction to pierce the corporate
veil. The judge concluded that, since the husband had the practical ability to procure
the transfer of the properties, he was ÔÔentitledÕÕ to them within the meaning of
section 24(1)(a), giving the court jurisdiction to make a transfer order in respect of
them. Accordingly, he ordered the husband to transfer or cause to be transferred to
the wife six properties and an interest in a seventh which were held in the name of two
of the husbandÕs companies. The Court of Appeal by a majority allowed an appeal by
the companies, holding that the Family DivisionÕs practice of treating the assets of
companies substantially owned by one party to the marriage as available for
distribution under section 24(1)(a) was beyond the jurisdiction of the court unless the
corporate personality of the company was being abused for a purpose which was in
some relevant respect improper or, on the particular facts, it could be shown that an
asset legally owned by the company was held in trust for the husband and that, since
the judge had rejected both of those possibilities, he ought not to have made the order.

On the wifeÕs appealÑ
Held, (1) that the recognition of a limited power to pierce the corporate veil and
to disregard the separate personality of a company in carefully deÞned circumstances

was necessary if the law were not to be disarmed in the face of abuse and, provided
that the limits were recognised and respected, it was consistent with the general
approach of English law to the problems raised by the use of legal concepts to defeat
mandatory rules of law; that, therefore, if a person were under an existing legal
obligation or liability or subject to an existing legal restriction which he deliberately
evaded or the enforcement of which he deliberately frustrated by interposing a
company under his control, the court could pierce the corporate veil for the purpose,
and only for the purpose, of depriving that company or its controller of the advantage
which they would otherwise have obtained by the companyÕs separate legal
personality; but that the legal interest in the disputed properties was vested in the
companies and, whatever the husbandÕs reasons for organising matters in that way,
there was no evidence that he was seeking to avoid any obligation which was relevant
in the present proceedings; and that, accordingly, there was no justiÞcation as a
matter of general legal principle for piercing the corporate veils of the companies
(post, Supreme Court judgments, paras 27, 35—36, 57—58, 61, 80—82, 96, 97, 103,
104).

Gilford Motor Co Ltd v Horne [1933] Ch 935, CA, Jones v Lipman [1962]
1 WLR 832, Gencor ACP Ltd v Dalby [2000] 2 BCLC 734 and Trustor AB v
Smallbone (No 2) [2001] 1 WLR 1177 considered.

(2) That, where there was no justiÞcation as a matter of general legal principle for
piercing the corporate veil, no special and wider principle applied in matrimonial
proceedings by virtue of section 24(1)(a) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973; that
section 24(1)(a) invoked concepts of the law of property, with an established legal
meaning and recognised legal incidents under the general law, which could not be
suspended or mean something di›erent in matrimonial proceedings; that there was
nothing in the 1973 Act, or in its purpose or broader social context, to indicate that
the legislature had intended to authorise the transfer by one party to the marriage to
the other of property which was not his to transfer; that such a transfer would
ordinarily be unnecessary for the purpose of achieving a fair distribution of the assets
of the marriage since, if assets belonged to a company owned by one party to the
marriage, the proper claims of the other could ordinarily be satisÞed by directing the
transfer of shares and, so far as a party deliberately attempted to frustrate the exercise
of the courtÕs ancillary powers by disposing of assets, section 37 of the Act provided
for the setting aside of those dispositions in certain circumstances; that the
recognition of a jurisdiction such as the judge had sought to exercise would cut across
the statutory schemes of company and insolvency law, which were essential for the
protection of those dealing with a company; and that, accordingly, section 24(1)(a)
did not give the judge power to order the husband to transfer to the wife property to
which he was not in law entitled (post, Supreme Court judgments, paras 37—41,
57—58, 86, 88—89, 96, 97, 103, 104).

But, (3) allowing the appeal, that the companies could be ordered to convey the
seven disputed properties to the wife under section 24(1)(a) of the 1973 Act if the
properties belonged beneÞcially to the husband by virtue of
the particular
circumstances in which they had come to be vested in the companies; that that issue
required an examination of evidence which, almost entirely due to the husbandÕs
persistent obstruction and mendacity, was incomplete and in critical respects
obscure; that in claims for ancillary relief in matrimonial proceedings, which had a
substantial inquisitorial element, judges were entitled to draw on their experience
and to take notice of
the inherent probabilities when deciding what an
uncommunicative spouse was likely to be concealing; that the wife had expressly
alleged that the husband had used the companies to hold legal title to properties
which belonged beneÞcially to him and the judgeÕs Þndings about the ownership
and control of the companies meant that the companiesÕ refusal to co-operate with
the proceedings was a course ultimately adopted on the direction of the husband;
that it was a fair inference that the main, if not the only, reason for the companiesÕ
failure to co-operate was to protect the seven properties, which in turn suggested

that proper disclosure of the facts would reveal them to have been held beneÞcially
by the husband; and that, accordingly, the seven disputed properties were held by
the companies on trust for the husband and, in those circumstances, the order of
the judge requiring the properties to be transferred to the wife would be restored
(post, Supreme Court judgments, paras 44—45, 55, 57—58, 84—85, 96, 97, 103,
104).

Herrington v British Railways Board [1972] AC 877, HL(E) and R v Inland

Revenue Comrs, Ex p TC Coombs & Co [1991] 2 AC 283, HL(E) considered.

Per Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury PSC, Lord Clarke of Stone-cum-Ebony and
Lord Sumption JJSC.
If it is not necessary to pierce the corporate veil, it is not
appropriate to do so, because on that footing there is no public policy imperative
which justiÞes that course (post, Supreme Court judgments, paras 35, 62, 103).

approved.

313, para 79, CA disapproved.

Dictum in VTB Capital plc v Nutritek International Corpn [2012] 2 LloydÕs Rep

Per Lord Mance and Lord Clarke of Stone-cum-Ebony JJSC. The court should
not seek to foreclose all possible future situations which may arise. However, the
situations in which piercing the corporate veil may be available as a fall-back are
likely to be very rare and no one should be encouraged to think that any further
exception, in addition to the evasion principle, will be easy to establish (post,
Supreme Court judgments, paras 100, 102, 103).

Per Lord Sumption JSC. Whether assets legally vested in a company are
beneÞcially owned by its controller is a highly fact-speciÞc issue. But, in the case of
the matrimonial home, the facts are quite likely to justify the inference that the
property was held on trust for a spouse who owned and controlled the company
(post, Supreme Court judgments, para 52).

APPEAL from Moylan J

By a petition dated 10 March 2008 the wife, Yasmin Aishatu Mohammed
Prest, petitioned for a decree of divorce from her husband, Michael Jenseabla
Prest. She applied in those proceedings for ancillary relief against the husband.
On 27 February 2009 and 14 April 2011 Petrodel Resources Ltd (ÔÔPRLÕÕ),
Petrodel Resources (Nigeria) Ltd, Petrodel Upstream Ltd (ÔÔUpstreamÕÕ),
Vermont Petroleum Ltd (ÔÔVermontÕÕ), Elysium Diem Ltd, Petrodel Resources
(Nevis) Ltd and Elysium Diem (Nevis) Ltd, were joined as parties to the
proceedings. By a judgment dated 4 October 2011 [2011] EWHC 2956 (Fam)
and order dated 16 November 2011 Moylan J ordered, inter alia, that the
husband transfer or cause to be transferred to the wife (i) four London
properties and an interest in a Þfth all held in the name of PRL and (ii) two
London properties held in the name of Vermont.

By an appellantÕs notice Þled on 7 December 2011 and pursuant to
permission granted by the Court of Appeal (Thorpe LJ) on 16 February
2012 PRL, Upstream and Vermont (together ÔÔthe Petrodel companiesÕÕ)
appealed on the ground that the judge had misdirected himself in law in
relation to the true construction of section 24(1)(a) of the Matrimonial Causes
Act 1973 in that he had wrongly directed himself that as a matter of law assets
of the Petrodel companies fell within the scope of section 24(1)(a) as being
ÔÔproperty to which [the husband] is entitled, either in possession or reversionÕÕ.

Introduction

1 On 4 October 2011 Moylan J [2011] EWHC 2956 (Fam) delivered
judgment in the Þnancial provision case Prest v Prest, a truly extraordinary
case even within the breadth and depth of family division bounds.

2 The husband and wife are both about 50 and both have dual Nigerian
and British citizenship. The husband was born in Nigeria, the wife in
England, both are highly educated. The husband was called to the Nigerian
Bar. The wife graduated from Thames Polytechnic and subsequently
obtained an MBA from CranÞeld.

3 They met in 1992 and married in 1993. They have four children
who are teenagers. Throughout the marriage they lived principally in
London but with properties in Nigeria and the Caribbean. They lived to a

three companies.

the husband has been prominent and successful

times

4 As well as the husband and the Þrst respondent, there were seven
corporate respondents. None of the corporate respondents took any part in
the proceedings until the Þnal hearing when the second, fourth and Þfth
appeared by leading counsel.

5 In para 3 of his judgment Moylan J thus recorded the principal issues

in the case:

ÔÔ(a) The extent of the husbandÕs wealth including the nature and
extent of his interest in the respondent companies; and (b) whether I can
make orders directly against properties and shares held in the name of
some of the respondent companies.ÕÕ
6 Continuing with his introduction, the judge recorded the husbandÕs

case that the net excess of his liabilities over assets equalled £48m.

7 The wifeÕs case was that the husbandÕs assets net of liabilities equalled

ÔÔtens if not hundreds of millions of poundsÕÕ.

8 Thus on issue (a) the gulf between the respective positions of the

husband and wife could hardly have been wider.

9 As to issue (b) Mr Todd QC, for the wife, stressed the extent of the
courtÕs power under section 24(1)(a) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973
which enabled orders to be made against alter ego companies. Mr Todd
relied on Nicholas v Nicholas [1984] FLR 285. He distinguished Ben
Hashem v Al Shayif [2009] 1 FLR 115. Alternatively if Ben HashemÕs case
was not to be distinguished Mr Todd asserted impropriety in respect of the
companies. Mr Todd further submitted that the companies held the shares
and assets as bare trustee for the husband.

10 Mr Pointer QC for the husband and Mr Wagsta›e QC for the
companies disputed the assertion that the properties and shares in the
company were held on trust for the husband and they further submitted that
the authority of Ben HashemÕs case prevented the judge from making orders
against the properties or the shares.

11 As to outcome the wife sought an overall award of £30.4m. The

husband proposed a package that amounted to a little over £2m.

12 As is not uncommon in this specialist Þeld of litigation the husband
had repeatedly ßouted his duty to give full frank and clear disclosure of his
Þnances. He was in breach of many orders for disclosure; he had been
repeatedly condemned in costs which he had not paid. At trial his evidence

was both deceitful and shambolic. In paras 12—13 of his judgment Moylan J
stated:

ÔÔ12. . . . I have sought to make sense of the husbandÕs factual case.
Ultimately I have decided that this has been a vain task because the
husband has failed so comprehensively to comply with his obligation to
provide full and frank disclosure and to give clear evidence that his case
does not permit of such an exercise . . . the result of the way in which the
case has developed is that a great deal of energy has been expended by the
husband on seeking to establish what he is not worth rather than the more
conventional focus being on seeking to demonstrate what he is worth . . .
ÔÔ13. . . . his evidence consisted signiÞcantly of obfuscation and

dissembling.ÕÕ
13 This introduction to the case illustrates what a di–cult and
frustrating task the judge faced. Responsibility for that state of a›airs rested
squarely with the husband and his companies.

The proceedings and the trial

14 The proceedings have not run smoothly. In para 34 of the judgment

below Moylan J recorded:

ÔÔThe husband has not voluntarily paid any part of the maintenance
pending suit order in respect of costs. This is not a minor breach of the
order; it is a signiÞcant failure.
It is made the more signiÞcant when
contrasted with the fact that the husband has paid in excess of £760,000
towards his own costs.ÕÕ
15 In a manoeuvre which I have not previously encountered the
husbandÕs brother issued against the husband and one of his companies an
application in the High Court in Nigeria which produced an order
unopposed restraining the husband from: (i) disclosing any information
concerning the accounts or a›airs of the company; (ii) asserting or disclosing
information that he is sole owner of the company.

16 As to this device the judge recorded at para 142 of his judgment:

ÔÔNotwithstanding the terms of the Nigerian order the husband has
been able to produce documents which would appear to be covered by its
terms. They have been produced at random and in a manner which has
given me the clear impression that the husband does so when he considers
it might help his case . . . Such attempts to manipulate the process
have been a recurrent feature of the husbandÕs conduct during the
proceedings.ÕÕ
17 In like manner when the senior master directed a letter of request to
judicial authorities in the Isle of Man, a director of the Manx company
avoided production, asserting concerns about claims that would be made
against the board by shareholders or commercial partners for breach of
conÞdence. Of that Moylan J aptly said, at para 47:

ÔÔGiven the husbandÕs control over the corporate structure, it is hard to
understand how these concerns could be genuine. It is not di–cult, in my
judgment, to see the hand of the husband behind this obstructive line

which is also reßected in letters written on behalf of the company by
Manx advocates.ÕÕ
18 These sort of manoeuvrings in the interlocutory stages gravely
impede the court and waste large sums of money. The trial judge faced a
formidable task when he sat between 13 and 30 June 2011 to conduct the
Þnal hearing. He heard extensive oral evidence. As well as the husband and
the wife there were two accountants whose evidence was of very limited
value since they at least agreed that neither had received the information and
documents that would enable them to make any worthwhile assessment or
valuation. However, there was a strong card in the wifeÕs hand given that
she was able to call as a witness Mr Le Breton, a former business associate
and fellow director of the husband.

19 The interval between 30 June and 4 October resulted from the
judgeÕs struggle to make sense of the evidence and some 30 lever arch Þles of
documents.

20 Between paras 55 and 78 of his judgment the judge wrestled with the
incomplete,
inadequate, confused and conßicting evidence as to the
husbandÕs activities through the corporate vehicles. The husband sought to
rely on the evidence of a director of
the companies, Mr Murphy.
In para 69 the judge concluded that
Mr Murphy chose not to appear.
Mr Murphy was unwilling rather than unable to attend.

21 In this section of his judgment the judge made two crucial Þndings.

This is the Þrst:

ÔÔI am satisÞed that the directors of the group, including Mr Murphy,
act in accordance with instructions given by or on behalf of the husband.
The husband was unable in his oral evidence to provide details of any
speciÞc occasion when the directors had not acted in accordance with his
instructions.ÕÕ
22 Here is the second: ÔÔI have no doubt at all that the husband does,
indeed, just draw from PRL whatever he and his family need, as and when
they need it.ÕÕ

23 In the next section of his judgment the judge reviewed the London
properties. Apart from the Þnal matrimonial home there were 11. Apart
from one they were all in the name of one or other company. BNP had a loan
charged against the properties. As to that the judge said, at para 84:

ÔÔHowever, as a result of the husbandÕs failure to give clear disclosure,
the evidence is not su–cient for me to reach any Þrm conclusions as to
what the true net position is in respect of the loan due to BNP.ÕÕ
24 The judge then reviewed the overseas properties and recorded the
evidence that had been given by the husband and the wife. He also recorded
the evidence of Mr Le Breton. In his evidence Mr Le Breton asserted that the
husband was the ultimate owner of the companies. This is the judgeÕs
record, at para 120, of his evidence:

ÔÔthe husband was the e›ective owner of the Petrodel Group. He
controlled every business decision. The directors acted merely on his
instructions. Throughout the seven or eight years that he worked with the
husband and Petrodel,
the directors, according to Mr Le Breton,
acted only on the husbandÕs instructions. There was also signiÞcant

expenditure through Petrodel for the beneÞt of the husband, the wife and
the children but Mr Le Breton was not aware of any signiÞcant sums
being spent for other family members. There are also investments made
through the company which were not business opportunities but were, he
said, Ôprivate commitments that (the husband) chose to makeÕ.ÕÕ
25 Mr Le Breton also informed the judge that between 2001 and 2004

the husband stated that he was worth between $40 to $50m.

26 Of the wifeÕs evidence the judge said, at para 123: ÔÔI found the wife
to be a careful and honest witness. She gave her evidence in a calm and
dispassionate manner which was convincing.ÕÕ

27 The judge continued, at para 124:

ÔÔI also found Mr le Breton to be an honest witness . . . As I have
said . . . I am satisÞed that his evidence was reliable. For many years
Mr Le Breton and the husband were very close work colleagues and were
also friends. I am satisÞed that Mr Le Breton is in a very good position to
give me an accurate insight into the husbandÕs and PetrodelÕs a›airs.ÕÕ
28 By contrast the judge said, at para 125:

ÔÔI have found the husband to be a wholly unreliable witness. The
husband is clearly an extremely intelligent, articulate and astute
individual. I form the clear impression that he regards the proceedings as
a game in which he has sought to manipulate the process to his advantage.
Despite occasional suggestions, largely by prompting, that he was seeking
to help the court, the husband was an extremely evasive witness. He was
adroit but was deliberately evasive. He would frequently fail to answer a
question although he clearly understood its meaning and would often
digress on to a di›erent subject or ask questions about the question. I do
not consider that I can rely on any of the husbandÕs evidence unless
corroborated by other reliable evidence.ÕÕ
29 Having then condemned the husband for his breach of obligation to

provide full frank and clear disclosure he said, at para 127:

ÔÔIt would, as I have said, be a vain task to seek to make sense of his
evidence because I am satisÞed that much of it was opportunistic in that
he would say whatever he felt at the moment best suited his case or at
least provided him with an answer to the question.ÕÕ
30 The husband had asserted that he held corporate assets in trust for
his birth family because the initial capital, or seed money, had been supplied
by his father subject to that trust. This manoeuvre was trenchantly
dismissed. The judge said, in para 136: ÔÔI found the husbandÕs evidence on
this issue particularly unconvincing and I am satisÞed that it is a deliberate
invention.ÕÕ Then in the next paragraph two sentences must be cited:

ÔÔI am satisÞed the husbandÕs evidence as to the existence of any seed
moneys is false. This has been invented for the purposes of seeking to
defeat the wifeÕs claims . . . In so far as the husband has interests in the
group or any of the companies within it or any of the assets held by the
companies, such interests are held solely for the beneÞt of himself and his
immediate family.ÕÕ

31 When the judge turned to the section 25 exercise he considered the

general position thus in para 143:

ÔÔAs a result of the husbandÕs failure to provide proper disclosure and
honest evidence I do not have the information needed to enable me to
determine the extent and value of the husbandÕs resources.
I am
I have rejected

his attempt to rely on the Nigerian proceedings and orders.
I am
satisÞed that they are based on a false factual case and were contrived at
the husbandÕs instigation in an attempt
to provide him with an
explanation for his failure to comply with his obligations in these
proceedings.ÕÕ
32 In relation to Petrodel the judge said:

ÔÔSpeciÞcally as a result of the husbandÕs failure to comply with his
disclosure obligations, the evidence which would be required to enable
the value of Petrodel to be determined is almost completely lacking.ÕÕ
33 At least the judge was able to value the London properties at £11.3m

gross and £9m net.

34 As to standard of living, the husband accepted that the running costs
of the London home were about $400,000 per annum. He put his annual
income needs at £800,000. The wife put her annual needs for herself and the
children at £730,000.

35 CounselÕs submissions were predictable. Mr Todd relied upon
Nicholas v Nicholas [1984] FLR 285 and Mubarak v Mubarak [2001]
1 FLR 673. Mr Pointer relied on Ben Hashem v Al Shayif [2009] 1 FLR 115.
Mr Wagsta›e relied upon company rather than family authority, including
Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd [1897] AC 22, Adams v Cape Industries plc
[1990] Ch 433 and Prudential Assurance Co Ltd v Newman Industries Ltd
(No 2) [1982] Ch 204.

36 The judge in his review of authorities considered Nicholas v
Nicholas, Crittenden v Crittenden [1990] 2 FLR 361, Mubarak v Mubarak,
Minwalla v Minwalla [2005] 1 FLR 771, W v H (Family Division: Without
Notice Orders) [2001] All ER 300, A v A [2007] 2 FLR 467 and Ben
Hashem v Al Shayif [2009] 1 FLR 115.

37 From his review of these authorities he drew out the following
principles. (a) Ownership and control were not in themselves su–cient to
pierce the corporate veil.
(b) Even where there was no unconnected third
party interest the veil could not be pierced only because it is necessary in
the interests of justice.
(c) The veil can only be pierced if there is
impropriety. (d) The impropriety must be linked to the use of the company
(e) In order to pierce the veil, both

control by the wrongdoer and impropriety must be demonstrated.
(f ) A
company may be a faade even though originally incorporated without
deceptive intent.

38 The judge then applied those principles to the facts before him. As to
Petrodel he held that the whole structure was for the husbandÕs beneÞt alone
and in his control, the husband ÔÔis able to change the structure and distribute
the wealth within it to himself and/or his family as may be required or,
I would add, as he wishesÕÕ.

39 The judge concluded this important section of his judgment in

paras 208—210 which I must cite in full:

ÔÔ208. I spent some time during the hearing, and longer since trying to
make sense of what appeared to be inconsistent themes in the husbandÕs
evidence and seeking to identify how they might be reconciled.
Ultimately I have decided that I have been seeking to impose an unduly
legalistic framework onto a relatively simple factual situation, namely
that the husband operates and controls the Petrodel group and its assets
for the beneÞt of his immediate family. The wealth within the group is the
familyÕs wealth to which the husband has unrestricted access.
I am
satisÞed that the husband is both the e›ective owner and controller of the
whole of Petrodel corporate structure.
In coming to this conclusion
I accept the evidence of Mr Le Breton that the husband told him that he is
the ultimate beneÞcial owner and I also accept his apposite phrase that
Petrodel is the husband and the husband is Petrodel. In my judgment, the
information memorandum as found by the wife accurately describes the
husband as the owner.

ÔÔ209. The extent to which the companies are the husbandÕs nominees
is demonstrated by the term in the contract, which I repeat, that he: Ôshall
be assumed to report
to the board for issues pertaining to the
management of the company, yet you shall have and employ full
discretion with the way you manage all the a›airs of the company in so
far as your actions are for the beneÞt of
the company and its
shareholders.Õ As the husband is the only e›ective shareholder, the
husband is managing the a›airs of the company solely for his beneÞt,
hence the complete lack of any need for real board control. The husband
has clearly used the companies to meet his and his familyÕs personal
expenditure, as well as his legal costs in these proceedings, without any
inhibition. The lack of any paper accounting also demonstrates the lack
of any board control or supervision.

ÔÔ210. I am also satisÞed that all the assets held within the companies
are e›ectively the husbandÕs property. He is able to procure their disposal
as he may direct based again on his being the controller of the companies
and the only beneÞcial owner. There are no third party interests of any
relevance because the other shareholders are merely nominal with no
expectation of beneÞting from their shareholdings.ÕÕ
40 The judge then turned to the heart of his judgment, the wifeÕs award.
He began by reminding himself of the dicta of Sachs J in J v J [1955] P 215 as
to not only the duty of disclosure but also the consequences of breach,
namely the drawing of adverse inferences. Being free to draw adverse
inferences the judge concluded: ÔÔI consider that, conservatively, the husband
must be worth at least $60m, i e approximately £37.5m.ÕÕ

41 From that conclusion the judge assessed the wifeÕs fair award at
£17.5m. The judge then addressed the vital question of how the husbandÕs
liability to the wife was to be discharged. Orders against foreign properties
would be di–cult to enforce. Orders against the husbandÕs shareholdings
impossible, given that they were shrouded in the mist of concealment,
subterfuge and lies. The judge felt unable to Þnd impropriety within the
meaning of the decided cases. The husbandÕs litigation misconduct was not
so much impropriety as the giving of false evidence. The judge considered

Prest v Prest (CA)
Prest v Prest (CA)

[2013] 2 AC

that he had to choose between the Nicholas approach and the Ben Hashem
approach. But the judgeÔs essential ratio is to be found in para 220 when he
posed the question: were the London houses ÔÔpropertyÕÕ to which the
husband was ÔÔentitled, either in possession or reversionÕÕ within the meaning
of section 24(1)(a). There could be no doubt that the houses were property.
Thus ÔÔthe crucial words are, therefore, Ôentitled either in possession or
reversion,Õ words which have not been the subject of any particular
analysisÕÕ. The judge then concluded that that test was satisÞed on the facts
of this exceptional case. The directors were ÔÔstooges or ciphersÕÕ. Payments
were made for the beneÞt of the husband and his family without any
apparent attempt to see whether the husband was entitled to such payments.
The wealth within the structure was freely available to be distributed as the
husband directed. Accordingly, at para 225:

ÔÔIn this case the husband can without inhibition acquire the properties
and shares which the wife seeks because, in e›ect, the companies are his
nominees or agents. As a result, in my judgment, the husband is ÔentitledÕ
to the shares and properties held in the names of the corporate
respondents because there is no impediment,
including third party
interests, to his enjoying the full beneÞt of those assets. They are held by
the companies for the husband because the corporate structure is being
used as a repository for the family wealth. E›ectively the husband, in
respect of the companies and their assets, is in the same position as he
would be in if he was the beneÞciary of a bare trust or the companies were
his nominees. There exists no legal impediment to his procuring the
transfer of the assets held by the companies into his name.
In the
language of the cases, they are his Ôalter egoÕ.ÕÕ
42 In so holding and ordering the judge rested on the statutory power of
section 24 which freed him from the constraints of company law as
identiÞed in Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd [1897] AC 22 and following
cases.

43 Accordingly, in the order giving e›ect to judgment, the husband was
ordered to transfer or cause to be transferred to the wife the London
properties together with three properties in Nevis and the shares in a Nevis
company. Following transfer the properties were to be sold and the net
proceeds of sale applied in satisfaction of the lump sum.

44 I have followed the structure of the judgment in such detail and
drawn out the judgeÕs Þndings and conclusions in order to substantiate my
opening observation that this was a truly exceptional case for the scale of the
husbandÕs litigation misconduct. There was almost no length to which he
was not prepared to go in order to attempt to defeat or diminish the wifeÕs
claim. In such a case the judgeÕs search for reality is never easy but it is vital
that the court should not be prevented or emasculated by the devious and
dishonest.

Submissions on appeal

45 It is in that context that I turn to the submissions on this appeal. The
only appellants are the three companies who have had the advantage of
representation by Mr Amos QC whose style of advocacy seems to clothe any
client with respectability. They also had the advantage of a specialist
company law junior in Mr Shaw.

46 Mr Amos Þrst urged that the word ÔÔentitledÕÕ could not mean by

custody or control but only by enforceable legal right.

47 Second, Mr Amos submitted that the corporate veil could only be
pierced if impropriety of a particular character could be established. That
proposition applied as much in Family as in Chancery proceedings. Ben
HashemÕs case [2009] 1 FLR 115 had been speciÞcally approved by the
recent decision of this court in VTB Capital plc v Nutritek International
Corpn [2012] 2 LloydÕs Rep 313.

48 Third, he submitted that that last word from this court implicitly
overruled the dicta in Nicholas v Nicholas [1984] FLR 285 and in In re
A Company [1985] BCLC 333.

49 Fourth, Mr Amos distinguished MubarakÕs case [2001] FLR 673.
Bodey J was considering the courtÕs powers in the enforcement of an award
arising from a contested hearing in which the husband had conceded that the
company assets were to be treated as his.

50 Finally Mr Amos submitted that the regulatory structure of company
law militated strongly in favour of allowing the appeal. For what the order
had achieved was to change the order of priority, not just preferring one
creditor over another but advancing the husband as shareholder over any
and all creditors.

51 Mr Todd QC and Mr Trowell essentially relied on the legal analysis
of Moylan J. However, Mr Todd submitted that Ben HashemÕs case and
NicholasÕs case were not in conßict rather that they illustrated the operation
of two separate principles. Ben HashemÕs case considered and applied to
Þnancial provision cases the classic rules of company law which tightly
conÞned the circumstances in which a court might pierce the corporate veil.
However, Nicholas v Nicholas recognised an essential power in Þnancial
provision cases to make orders against assets which undoubtedly belonged
to the husband, despite the fact that he might, for whatever reason, have
chosen to hold them in a trust or company.

Conclusions

52 In weighing these rival submissions on the development of the case
law I prefer the submissions of Mr Todd. Were there only one line of
authority and were the Family Division judge bound to apply the
company law as stated in the VTB case [2012] 2 LloydÕs Rep 313, in
many cases he or she would be unable to make orders fair to applicant
wives.

53 The powers of redistribution of assets on pronouncement of a
decree came into force on 1 January 1971 and the development of the
necessary case law was a gradual process. The decision in Nicholas v
Nicholas [1984] FLR 285 can be seen as a relatively early pronouncement
of the power necessary to enable the judge in Þnancial provision cases to do
justice.

54 More recently, Munby J was ideally qualiÞed to hold the balance
between the family law and the company law authorities. Important is his
decision in W v H (Family Division: Without Notice Orders) [2001] 1 All ER
300. Between pp 310E and 311D Munby J recognised the importance of the
power of Family Division judge in Þnancial provision cases as Þrst stated in
Nicholas v Nicholas. He struck the balance in Þnancial provision

proceedings precisely when he said in the Þnal paragraph of the passage to
which I have referred above:

A

ÔÔNothing that I say should be taken as intended to water down in any
way the robustness with which the Family Division ought to deal in
appropriate cases with husbands who seek to obfuscate or to hide or
mask the reality behind shams, artiÞcial devices and similar contrivances.
Nor do I doubt for a moment the propriety and utility of treating as one
and the same a husband and some corporate or trust structure which it is
apparent is simply the alter ego or creature of the husband. On the other
hand, and as the Nicholas case itself demonstrates, the court does notÑin
my judgment cannot properlyÑadopt this robust approach where, for
example, property is held by a company in which, although the husband
has a majority shareholding, the minority shareholdings are what
Cumming-Bruce LJ called Ôreal interestÕ held by individuals who as
Dillon LJ put it, are not nominees but business associates of the husband.ÕÕ
55 I would adopt that paragraph as a clear statement of the principle

properly and necessarily applied in family provision proceedings.

56 When Munby J came to deliver his judgment in Ben HashemÕs case
[2009] 1 FLR 115 the number of cases referred to in the judgment is
impressive and includes his earlier decision in W v H (cited as In re W (Ex
parte Orders) which is how it had been designated in the Family Law
Reports).

57 In A v A [2007] 2 FLR 467 Munby J had emphasised that his
observations in W v H did not permit a court to ride rough shod over
established principles especially if third party interests were involved. In Ben
HashemÕs case [2009] 1 FLR 115, para 94 he made the same point, citing
from his judgment in A v A those paragraphs in which he had set limit on his
prior observations in W v H. Thus, although in A v A and Ben HashemÕs
case I Þnd Munby J cautioning against excess and emphasising that company
law was uniform in all divisions, he does not disavow the propositions stated
in W v H.

58 I would not complicate the approach that a Family Division judge
can legitimately adopt either by reference to company law authority on
ÔÔlifting or piercing the corporate veilÕÕ or by questioning whether judges have
used an alternative expression of the same principle when they have referred
to ownership by an alter ego. The simple question is whether the individual
is entitled to the property within the meaning of section 24(1)(a). The
Family Division judges with particular expertise in this Þeld (such as, Bodey,
Coleridge and Mostyn JJ) have on many occasions stressed the need to get to
the reality in determining the assets to which the husband is entitled. Indeed
Mostyn J in an obiter passage in his judgment in Hope v Krejci [2012]
EWHC 1780 (Fam), handed down on 29 June 2012, considered the impact
of the decision in the VTB case. He concluded in para 22:

ÔÔI can easily see why these principles are critically necessary when the
objective is that which was sought in the VTB case, namely to deem
someone to be a party to a contract to which he plainly is not. But I have
great di–culty in seeing why they must be satisÞed for the form of
piercing of the veil that is the telescoping order, which is almost
invariably the situation confronted in Þnancial remedy proceedings.ÕÕ

59 Moylan J, whose expertise in this area is no less, adopted that

approach and thereby achieved justice for the applicant.

60 Mr AmosÕs submissions in this court are essentially the submissions
advanced by Mr Wagsta› below. They were rightly rejected by the judge.
Vital are the judgeÕs Þndings as to the complete absence of boundaries
between the husband and his companies observed by not only him, who is
not an appellant, but also the companies, who are. On the exceptional facts
of this case I conclude that the judge was entitled to order the husband to
transfer or cause to be transferred the assets which he did.

61 In the course of argument we were referred to a process which is
known as telescoping which involves ordering the individual not to transfer
the property but to transfer shares or to vote himself dividends or loans as a
route to the property. That seems to me both cumbersome, expensive and
uncertain to achieve the desired end.
It is to import the discipline of
company law in to a situation where at all material times the individual has
not respected or utilised that discipline. However, that point hardly arises in
the present case where none of the parties has ever advocated it.

62 As indicated above I would dismiss this appeal.
63 I have of course reviewed the judgment which I wrote in July in
response to the receipt in October of the powerful judgment written by
Rimer LJ. However, despite its cogency I emphasise that all judges who have
endeavoured to achieve fairness in big money cases at Þrst instance,
including Munby J, have followed the pathway marked by Cumming-
Bruce LJ, himself a former judge of the Division. I myself followed this path
in the eight years that I sat in the Division and I have not questioned it in the
more years that I have sat in this court. If this court now concludes that all
these cases were wrongly decided they present an open road and a fast car to
the money maker who disapproves of the principles developed by the House
of Lords that now govern the exercise of the judicial discretion in big money
cases.

64 In this case the reality is plain. So long as the marriage lasted, the
husbandÕs companies were milked to provide him and his family with an
extravagant lifestyle. That was only possible because the companies were
wholly owned and controlled by the husband and there were no third party
interests. Of course in so operating them the husband ignored all company
law requirements and checks.

65 Once the marriage broke down, the husband resorted to an array of
strategies, of varying degrees of ingenuity and dishonesty, in order to deprive
his wife of her accustomed a´uence. Amongst them is his invocation of
company law measures in an endeavour to achieve his irresponsible and
selÞsh ends. If the law permits him so to do it defeats the Family Division
judgeÕs overriding duty to achieve a fair result.

Introduction

66 This appeal raises a question as to the courtÕs jurisdiction in
ancillary relief proceedings between spouses to order assets held by
companies to be transferred to the applicant spouse in or towards
satisfaction of her claim. The applicant (respondent to the appeal) was
Yasmin Prest (ÔÔthe wifeÕÕ). Michael Prest (ÔÔthe husbandÕÕ), the main

[2013] 2 AC

respondent to her application, was originally an appellant but his appeal
was struck out for want of compliance with conditions of orders of the
court. The remaining appellants, also respondents to her application, are
three companies in his control: Petrodel Resources Ltd (ÔÔPRLÕÕ), Petrodel
Upstream Ltd (ÔÔUpstreamÕÕ) and Vermont Petroleum Ltd (ÔÔVermontÕÕ). All
three are incorporated in the Isle of Man.

67 The main orders under challenge are those in para 5 of Moylan JÕs
order of 16 November 2011 by which he ordered the husband to ÔÔtransfer or
cause to be transferredÕÕ to the wife: (i) four London properties and an
interest in a Þfth all ÔÔheld in the name ofÕÕ PRL; and (ii) two London
properties ÔÔheld in the name ofÕÕ Vermont. Para 5 did not also relate to
properties held by Upstream, but Upstream appeals (as do PRL and
Vermont) against other orders made by the judge, including his costs orders,
although there is no need to refer further to them in this judgment.

68 In making the para 5 orders the judge was purporting to exercise the
jurisdiction conferred upon the court by section 24(1)(a) of the Matrimonial
Causes Act 1973, which provides so far as material:

ÔÔOn granting a decree of divorce . . . the court may make any one or
more of the following orders, that is to sayÑ (a) an order that a party to
the marriage shall transfer to the other party . . . such property as may be
so speciÞed, being property to which the Þrst-mentioned party is entitled,
either in possession or reversion . . .ÕÕ (Emphasis supplied.)
69 A question that exercised the judge, and this court on the appeal, was
whether the properties the subject of his para 5 orders were ÔÔpropertyÕÕ to
which the husband was so entitled. Only if they were did the judge have
jurisdiction to make the orders. Thorpe LJ has concluded that the judge was
entitled to regard the properties as such ÔÔpropertyÕÕ and so make the orders
that he did.

70 I respectfully disagree with Thorpe LJÕs reasoning and conclusion
and would allow the appeals against the para 5 orders.
I consider, with
respect, that the judge fell into fundamental error. He made no primary
Þndings justifying any conclusion other than that the properties were part of
the assets of, and belonged beneÞcially to, the companies that respectively
owned them. He held, however, that the husbandÕs sole control of the
companies as their 100% owner enabled him to deal as he wished with
the companiesÕ assets, and that it followed that the husband was therefore
the beneÞcial owner of such assets and so ÔÔentitledÕÕ to them within the
meaning of section 24(1)(a).

71 In so holding the judge was wrong. He should have held that
section 24(1)(a) had no application to the para 5 properties and gave the
court no jurisdiction to make the orders. That is because the shareholders of
a company have no interest in, let alone entitlement to, the companyÕs assets
and the same applies to a shareholder who is a 100% owner of the company.
The distinction between the respective legal personalities, rights and
liabilities of a company and those of its shareholders is as valid today as
when the House of Lords decided Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd [1897]
AC 22 and it applies as much in the disposition of ancillary relief proceedings
as in other proceedings. The judge, however, simply equated the companies
with the husband and regarded their assets as his.

72 The judge gave a very full judgment in which he explained that the
husbandÕs failure to co-operate in the disclosure process and to give clear
evidence prevented him from giving a comprehensive account into which all
the pieces of the jigsaw could be Þtted. I do not question that such lack of
co-operation made the judgeÕs task more di–cult than it should have been.
The judgeÕs Þndings of central
importance are, however, as to the
companies, their ownership and their assets and I must explain them.

73 The structure of the many companies in the Petrodel group is
complicated but the relevant shareholdings are as follows. A Nevis
company, Petrodel Resources (Nevis) Ltd (ÔÔthe Nevis companyÕÕ), holds
100% of Upstream. The Nevis company also holds 97.5% of a Nigerian
company called Petrodel Resources (Nigeria) Ltd (ÔÔPRNLÕÕ), the other 2.5%
being held as to half each by the wife and Helen Davies (the husbandÕs
sister). PRNL holds 99.99% of PRL, with the other 0.01% being held by
Margaret Wilson, the wifeÕs mother; and PRNL and PRL respectively hold
51% and 49% of Vermont. The husbandÕs evidence was that the Nevis
company (which owned 97.5% of PRNL) was itself wholly owned as to
100% by PRNL. The judge said (para 55(c)) that ÔÔthis alleged circular
ownership is but one of the puzzling features of this caseÕÕ. He also,
however, referred to the di›erent evidence of Mr Le Breton (who had
worked in the Petrodel group until 2008), which was that the Nevis
company was not owned by PRNL but that its shares were held for the
husbandÕs beneÞt through a trust; and at the hearing of the appeal,
Mr Amos QC, for the appellants, told us that the Nevis company is now
owned by a Nevis entity called the Family One Foundation, whose shares are
held on trust for, amongst others, the husband. There are other companies
in the group to which the judge referred in his judgment, but it is unnecessary
to refer to them. The appeals are only about, or only directly about, PRL,
Vermont and Upstream.

74 The judge said (para 55(b)) that PRNL was ÔÔe›ectively a holding
company for [PRL]ÕÕ. Both companies were incorporated in 1993. PRL was
the main trading company of the group, its accounts showing that it started
trading in 2002. Its original shareholders were the husband and the wife and
its Þrst directors were relatives of the wife. By the trial, its shareholding was
held as I have described and its directors were Ms Walters and Mr Murphy,
the latter providing his services through a management company. The judge
found that the husband began working full-time in the group in 2005, as
chief executive o–cer of PRL. The judge said of PRL, at para 22, that:

ÔÔ[it] has been involved in the oil business in what are called
downstream activities, namely trade and transportation, and more
recently has been involved in upstream activities, namely oil exploration
and production. Accounts for the years 2005, 2007 and 2008 . . . show
turnover of between $572m and $1,400m and proÞts of between just
under $3m and approximately $6m.ÕÕ
75 The judge referred, at para 77, to the husbandÕs evidence that
although PRL was still trading in gasoline, it had not undertaken a trade
since one e›ected in early 2010 for which payment remained due.
Documents produced during the trial showed, however, that ÔÔsubstantial
trades have continued to be made by companies within the group being,

probably, either [Vermont] and/or [the Nevis company]ÕÕ. Both PRL and
Vermont are, or were, trading companies.

76 The former matrimonial home, 16, Warwick Avenue, London W2,
was bought in PRLÕs name in 2001. The judge said, at para 228, that if it
were necessary so to decide, he would have held that Warwick Avenue was
held by PRL on trust, or as a nominee, for the husband (he had earlier set out
the evidence justifying such a Þnding) and (by para 3 of his order) he ordered
its transfer to the wife. There is no appeal against that order, permission to
appeal having been refused. As for the seven other London properties
respectively held by PRL and Vermont which are the subject of the appeals,
the judge made no like Þnding that any was held either on trust, or as
nominee, for the husband although he had been pressed by the wife to do so.
The judge explained that all the London properties were the subject of a
charge by their respective corporate owners to BNP Paribas and that all save
for Warwick Avenue were also charged to Ahli United Bank (UK) plc. The
charged properties had a combined gross value of £11.3m, the indebtedness
to Ahli being just under £1.9m.
In paras 80—84 and 159—161, the judge
explained the evidence as to the indebtedness to BNP Paribas but was unable
to make a clear Þnding as to its amount. On one view, it may have been
about $7.6m.

77 The judge made an important Þnding as to the husbandÕs role in the
governance of PRL. He referred to Mr Le BretonÕs evidence that its directors
acted pursuant to the husbandÕs instructions and to the terms of the
husbandÕs employment contract as chief executive o–cer, which gave him
full discretion as to the management of PRLÕs a›airs ÔÔin so far as [his]
actions are for the beneÞt of the company and its shareholdersÕÕ. He said, at
para 70, that:

ÔÔI am satisÞed that the directors of the group, including Mr Murphy,
act in accordance with instructions given by or on behalf of the husband.
The husband was unable in his oral evidence to provide details of any
speciÞc occasion when the directors had not acted in accordance with his
instructions.ÕÕ

The judge thus found the husband to be a ÔÔshadow directorÕÕ of PRL
(compare section 251(1) of the Companies Act 2006), although he did not so
describe him.

78 The judge explained (at paras 71—74) the unsatisfactory evidence in
relation to the directorsÕ current account shown in the PRL accounts, which
showed liabilities to directors of just over $10m for each of 2008 and 2009.
This appeared to ba´e the husband in his cross-examination, who at one
point denied that he had a current or loan account with PRL as he was not a
director. Despite this, the judge found it to be clear that ÔÔthere is no person
other than the husband to whom such sums could or would be dueÕÕ and he
referred to the husbandÕs acknowledgement elsewhere that he did have a
directorÕs loan account. The judge then said, at paras 74—75:

ÔÔ74. The loan account has not been produced.

Indeed, there is no
direct evidence at all as to how the husbandÕs income and bonuses are
dealt with in PRLÕs accounts save possibly for references to directorsÕ
remuneration which, given the amounts, are very unlikely to relate to
actual directors. Further, the amounts given for directorsÕ emoluments

are signiÞcantly less than the annual amounts spent by the husband on
himself and his family and for which there appears to be no signiÞcant
source other than PRL . . . The husband told me that he does not know
how his income and bonus are dealt with in the accounts. When he was
asked whether he receives any beneÞts from PRL other than his salary he
replied that this is an accounting question. When asked in cross-
examination to explain how some of the payments relating to the wifeÕs
mother were for the companyÕs beneÞt, the husband replied that she was a
shareholder. When Mr Todd asked whether a dividend had been
declared, the husband said he was not sure how this beneÞt or these
payments had been received.

ÔÔ75. It was suggested to the husband in the course of his cross-
examination that he just draws from PRL whatever he and his family
need. He denied this but when then asked how he paid for school fees he
said he would either pay it himself or he would take a directorÕs loan. The
only company of which the husband is a director is [PRNL]. There is no
indication that this company has had su–cient resources to enable school
fees to be paid. As the husbandÕs employment contract permits him to set
his own bonus, the whole exercise is artiÞcial in any event as, if required,
he could simply ascribe all payments made for his or his familyÕs beneÞt as
being part of his bonus.
I have no doubt at all that the husband does,
indeed, just draw from PRL whatever he and his family need, as and when
they need it.ÕÕ

The judge referred, at para 92, to the fact that school fees, other educational
costs, holidays in Italy and the cost of a chalet in Meribel had been paid by
PRL out of its Royal Bank of Scotland account in the Isle of Man.

79 The judge made certain Þndings with regard to the husbandÕs
interest in the Petrodel group between paras 199 and 210. He concluded as
follows, at paras 208—210:

ÔÔ208. I spent some time during the hearing, and longer since, trying to
make sense of what appeared to be inconsistent themes in the husbandÕs
evidence and seeking to identify how they might be reconciled.
Ultimately I have decided that I have been seeking to impose an unduly
legalistic framework onto a relatively simple factual situation, namely
that the husband operates and controls the Petrodel group and its assets
for the beneÞt of his immediate family. The wealth within the group is the
familyÕs wealth to which the husband has unrestricted access.
I am
satisÞed that the husband is both the e›ective owner and controller of the
whole of the Petrodel corporate structure. In coming to this conclusion
I accept the evidence of Mr Le Breton that the husband told him that he is
the ultimate beneÞcial owner and I also accept his apposite phrase that
Petrodel is the husband and the husband is Petrodel. In my judgment, the
Information Memorandum as found by the wife accurately describes the
husband as the owner.

ÔÔ209. The extent to which the companies are the husbandÕs nominees
is demonstrated by the term in his contract . . . that he Ôshall be assumed
to report to the board for issues pertaining to the management of the
company, yet you shall have and employ full discretion with the way you
manage all the a›airs of the company in so far as your actions are for the
beneÞt of the company and its shareholdersÕ. As the husband is the only

436

[2013] 2 AC
[2013] 2 AC

e›ective shareholder, the husband is managing the a›airs of the company
solely for his beneÞt, hence the complete lack of any need for real board
control. The husband has clearly used the companies to meet his and his
familyÕs personal expenditure, as well as his legal costs in these
proceedings, without any inhibition. The lack of proper accounting also
demonstrates the lack of any board control or supervision.

ÔÔ210. I am also satisÞed that all the assets held within the companies
are e›ectively the husbandÕs property. He is able to procure their disposal
as he may direct based again on his being the controller of the companies
and the only beneÞcial owner. There are no third party interests of any
relevance because the other shareholders are merely nominal with no
expectation of beneÞting from their shareholdings.ÕÕ
80 Those paragraphs include a clear Þnding that the husband was the
ultimate owner of the group and so in a position to control its a›airs. The
judge described him as the ÔÔe›ective ownerÕÕ of the group and I read the
ÔÔe›ectiveÕÕ as reßecting that, whilst the ultimate shareholding was not vested
in the husband, he was nevertheless its sole controller. Given the evidence he
heard, that Þnding was unsurprising and the appeals involved no challenge
to it.

81 The question in the appeal is not, however, as to the ownership of
the ultimate shareholding that conferred control of the group companies,
but as to the ownership of the properties the subject of the para 5 orders.
There is no dispute that they were vested in and held by one or other of PRL
and Vermont and so, prima facie, were their assets. They could not therefore
be made the subject of the para 5 orders unless the true analysis was that,
although held by the companies, they were properties to which the husband
was ÔÔentitled, either in possession or reversionÕ ÕÕ within the meaning of
section 24(1)(a). In para 210 the judge found that all the Petrodel groupÕs
assets were ÔÔe›ectively the husbandÕs propertyÕÕ. I interpret the ÔÔe›ectivelyÕÕ
as reßecting the judgeÕs reluctance, at any rate by that point in his judgment,
to go so far as to say that they were his property.

82 During the argument, Thorpe LJ suggested that the judge probably
there meant that the assets belonged to the husband ÔÔin realityÕÕ. With
respect, that is to substitute for the judgeÕs own imprecise wording a phrase
of like imprecision. The question for the judge was in principle simple.
Section 24(1)(a) obviously focuses only on property to which the respondent
spouse is beneÞcially entitled, the location of the legal title being immaterial.
The assets held by the companies (including therefore the properties) either
belonged beneÞcially to the companies or to the husband. No third
alternative was canvassed. Before the judge could make an order under
section 24(1)(a) in relation to the various London properties, he had to be
satisÞed that they were the husbandÕs beneÞcial property: and a Þnding that
were ÔÔe›ectivelyÕÕ his property (whatever that may mean) was not good
enough. The judge appears there to have been basing that Þnding on no
more than his primary Þnding that the husbandÕs sole control of the Petrodel
group carried with it the authority to deal with all the groupÕs assets. The
critical question, however, is whether such control meant that the husband
was in fact the beneÞcial owner of the companiesÕ assets and, therefore, that
the companies had no beneÞcial interest in them. The judge has not yet
answered that question unambiguously, although these paragraphs were not

his last word on the topic. The ordinary principle is that the shareholders of
a company (including a shareholder with 100% control) have no interest of
any nature in the companyÕs assets.

83 In paras 211—230, the judge explained the award that he proposed to
make in favour of the wife. In assessing the husbandÕs Þnancial resources,
which was the Þrst issue upon which the judge embarked, he referred again
to the husbandÕs failure to give full and frank disclosure of his resources and
held that he was entitled to draw adverse inferences against him. In making
his assessment, the judge took into account the value of his interests in the
Petrodel group and explained, in para 215, that he was satisÞed that the
husband had continued through Petrodel to trade successfully since 2004,
the accounts of PRL suggesting that it had made a net proÞt for the four
years 2005 to 2008 of $19m. The judge concluded that the husband ÔÔmust
be worth at least $60m, i e approximately £37.5mÕÕ. That Þnding reßected
that the husbandÕs wealth included the value of his ultimate shareholding in
the Petrodel group. The judge decided that a fair award to make to the wife
was for her to receive resources totalling £17.5m.

84 The judge turned, at para 217, to consider how that award should be
structured. Mr Todd QC, for the wife, had sought a lump sum order, with
property transfer orders in respect of the London properties and the
company shares in part satisfaction. Counsel for the husband and the
companies had respectively submitted that no direct orders could be made in
respect of the shares or properties held by the companies unless the judge
was able to ÔÔÞnd the requisite impropriety as set out in [Ben Hashem v Al
Shayif [2009] 1 FLR 115, a decision of Munby J]ÕÕ. That was a decision to
the e›ect that, without such a Þnding, it was not open to the court to pierce
the Petrodel companiesÕ veils of incorporation and so identify the companies
with the husband; and that, without such piercing and identiÞcation, there
was no basis for an order directly in respect of shares and/or properties held
by the companies, because such assets were their assets, not the husbandÕs.
The judge added that there was ÔÔalso the separate issue of whether the
companies hold the shares and properties on trust for the husband or as his
nomineeÕÕ. If the answer to that was yes, the route to the order sought by
Mr Todd was straightforward: because if such shares and/or properties were
so held, they were plainly ÔÔproperty to which [the husband was entitled],
either in possession or reversionÕÕ within the meaning of section 24(1)(a). In
the event, the judge declined to answer that latter question in the a–rmative.
85 Importantly, the judge also expressly rejected the case that there was
any relevant impropriety or, therefore (as might be thought to follow), any
case for piercing the corporate veils of the Petrodel companies. His reasons
were these, at paras 218—219:

ÔÔ218. Dealing Þrst with the issue of impropriety, has the wife
established that the company structure has been used to avoid or conceal
liability? In my judgment the company structure in this case was set up
and has been used for conventional reasons including wealth protection
and the avoidance of tax. Mr Todd is right, for example, to point to the
reference in the annex to the husbandÕs Form E to his transferring his
shares in [PRNL] to the Nevis company because he was involved in
litigation. However, this does not result in the company structure being
used to conceal or avoid liability.
It is seeking to provide a degree of

protection for the wealth, which may or may not be e›ective depending
on the nature of the rights retained by the husband. He is also right to
point to the company structure e›ectively being the husbandÕs money box
which he uses at will. This might be contrary to accounting or company
law principles but any disregard of those principles does not, in my view,
mean that the structure is being used to avoid or conceal liability. From
the husbandÕs perspective the wealth and the corporate structure is and
remains his but at the same time he is able to take advantage of the tax
and other beneÞts of holding it within a corporate structure.

ÔÔ219. I also do not accept Mr ToddÕs submission that the undoubted
use by the husband of the corporate structure to seek to deny that the
companies or their assets are his resources or are assets available to him
amounts to impropriety as that word is used in the authorities.
It is
simply a husband giving false evidence. Accordingly, I do not consider
that the wife has established impropriety in this case.ÕÕ
86 Having held that the conditions for piercing the corporate veil were
not satisÞed, the judge nevertheless went on to hold that the husband was
ÔÔentitledÕÕ to the relevant properties within the meaning of section 24(1)(a)
and, therefore, that he could and should make the para 5 orders for the
transfer of the properties held by PRL and Vermont. That reasoning
substantially repeated what the judge had found in paras 208—210 (quoted
above) but he re-reasoned the issues and I must set out what he said, at
paras 220—228. I should also Þrst set out his interpretation, in para 193, of
Bodey JÕs decision in Mubarak v Mubarak [2001] 1 FLR 673:

ÔÔ193. In essence, Bodey J decided, notwithstanding the comments in
[Crittenden v Crittenden [1990] 2 FLR 361], that property is within the
scope of section 24 if it is property to which a spouse is to be treated as
being ÔentitledÕ which can include property held by a company of which a
spouse e›ectively has complete, or perhaps more accurately a su–cient
degree of, control or ownership. Although the e›ect is to pierce the
corporate veil it is, in my view, a question of statutory interpretation.
Does the power given to the court by the Matrimonial Causes Act extend
to property held through a corporate or other structure to which one
spouse is (in e›ect) entitled through the use of rights and powers available
to him and her? Bodey J decided that if a party has e›ective control of the
legal or corporate structure and, because third party interests would not
be prejudiced, is also the only person e›ectively entitled to the beneÞt of
the property, then that property is within the scope of section 24 as being
Ôproperty to which . . . (that) party is entitled in possessionÕ.ÕÕ

ÔÔ220. In my judgment, the question I must decide is whether the
relevant shares and properties are ÔpropertyÕ to which the husband Ôis
entitled, either in possession or reversionÕ.
It is plain that the word
ÔpropertyÕ is extremely broad and covers all forms of property. The
crucial words are, therefore, Ôentitled either in possession or reversionÕ,
words which have not been the subject of any particular analysis. I agree
with Mr Wagsta›e that if a lay person was asked the question whether a
husband who owns a company which owns a house is entitled to the
house, they would reply in the a–rmative but I also agree with him that
I must decide from a legal perspective whether as a matter of statutory
interpretation, as applied to the facts of this case, the answer is the same.

In undertaking this task, I am persuaded that I should apply [Nicholas v
Nicholas [1984] FLR 285] and what appears to me to be Bodey JÕs
reasoning in Mubarak v Mubarak as set out in para 193 above.

ÔÔ221. As I have indicated, I am satisÞed that the husband has complete
control over the respondent companies both in terms of their operation
and in terms of their management. He is the controlling force and the
directors clearly act on his instructions. They are, to use the words of
Munby J from Ben HashemÕs case, the husbandÕs ÔstoogesÕ or ÔciphersÕ.
I could also adopt the following passage from Lord Denning MRÕs
judgment in Wallersteiner v Moir [1974] 1 WLR 991, 1013: ÔHe was in
control of them as much as any ÔÔone-man companyÕÕ is under the control
of the one man who owns all the shares and is the chairman and managing
director . . . He controlled their every movement. Each danced to his
bidding. He pulled the strings.Õ

ÔÔ222. There is no evidence that any of the directors of any of the
companies acted other
than in accordance with the husbandÕs
instructions. There is good evidence provided by Mr Le Breton that the
corporate structure, the whole of it, was managed as the husband directed
and I remind myself, again, of the terms of the husbandÕs contract of
employment. Payments were made for the beneÞt of the husband and his
family without any apparent attempt to see whether the husband was
entitled to such payments. I have seen no reference to any determination
being made of the husbandÕs bonus. The husband does not know how his
income and bonus were accounted for in the accounts. There is reference
to directorÕs remuneration but the amounts are substantially less than the
amounts paid to the husband or for the beneÞt of the family. The
husband himself accepts that the structure is such that he is able to e›ect
whatever might be required to meet his obligations under Itsekiri
customary law, be it transferring shares to his siblings or otherwise. How,
I ask, would the husband be able to achieve this if he is not the e›ective
owner of the whole group and of the companies?

ÔÔ223. The superÞcial nature of the company structure and the extent of
the husbandÕs control can be seen from his contract of employment and
the other matters to which I have referred. It is also clear to me that the
husband looks at things from the perspective of obligations or need. The
legal structure is of secondary importance save that clearly any such
structure must be capable of being used to enable his obligations and/or
his needs to be met. So, for example, if the husbandÕs customary law
obligations require him to give his siblings shares in the company, then
the structure must be such as to enable him to do so. I am conÞdent that
Mr Elusogbon did tell the husband not to worry because, indeed, the
structure which holds the wealth and assets can be adjusted as required,
or to put it another way the wealth held within the structure is freely
available to be distributed as the husband directs. It is di–cult to see how
this could be achieved by him unless he controls, in English law terms,
both the legal and the beneÞcial interest in the worth. Further, if the
husband not only has complete control but also is the sole e›ective
owner, which I have found that he is, in my judgment, again in English
law terms, I would see this as equating to beneÞcial ownership.

ÔÔ224. In summary, therefore, in my judgment the answer to the
question of whether an asset held in the legal name of a company is

' 2013 The Incorporated Council of Law Reporting for England and Wales

property which falls within section 24(1)(a) depends on the facts of the
case. It is right, of course, that as a matter of company law a shareholder
only has a right of participation in accordance with the articles of
association and has no right to any particular item of property. But, what
if the shareholder is, in fact, able to procure the transfer to them of a
particular item of company property, such as a matrimonial home, as a
result of their control and ownership of the property and the absence of
any third party interests. Am I to ignore the reality that the shareholder is
able to procure the transfer to them of that property for the purposes of
deciding whether it is property to which they are entitled?

ÔÔ225. In my judgment, it would be contrary to the purpose and
intention of the legislation if I were to do so. The legislation is intended to
ensure that marital wealth can be distributed by the court between the
parties in a fair and just manner. In this case the husband can without
inhibition acquire the properties and shares which the wife seeks because,
in e›ect, the companies are his nominees or agents. As a result, in my
judgment, the husband is ÔentitledÕ to the shares and properties held in the
names of the corporate respondents because there is no impediment,
including third party interests, to his enjoying the full beneÞt of these
assets. They are held by the companies for the husband because the
corporate structure is being used as a repository for the family wealth.
E›ectively the husband, in respect of the companies and their assets, is in
the same position he would be in if he was the beneÞciary of a bare trust
or the companies were his nominees. There exists no legal impediment to
his procuring the transfer of the assets held by the companies into his
name. In the language of the cases, they are his Ôalter egoÕ.

ÔÔ226. I do not consider that the company law principles, relied upon in
particular by Mr Wagsta›e, determine the scope of the powers given to
the court under the Matrimonial Causes Act.
In my view, if a party is
both the e›ective controller and the e›ective owner of a company it does
not strain the language of the Matrimonial Causes Act to decide that he is
Ôentitled . . . in possessionÕ to an asset held by that company such as the
former matrimonial home. This interpretation accords with what was
said in Nicholas v Nicholas. As identiÞed in Mubarak, he is entitled to the
asset in possession because he has the right and ability to procure its
transfer to him for his own use. This is not to challenge the principles
established by Salomon or Adams v Cape Industries plc or the other
authorities referred to in Ben HashemÕs case.
It is to recognise, as was
said by Slade LJ in the Cape case [1990] Ch 433, 536G, with my emphasis:
Ôsave in cases which turn on the wording of particular statutes, the court is
not free to disregard the principles of Salomon merely because it considers
that justice so requires.Õ

ÔÔ227. As a matter of general law the companies in the Petrodel group
may be separate legal entities but,
in my judgment, under the
Matrimonial Causes Act their assets fall within the scope of section 24 as
a result of the complete nature of the husbandÕs control and ownership.
As Mr Wagsta›e submitted, the wife can have no stronger claim than the
husbandÕs. In this case, as a result of control and ownership, the husband
is able to procure the transfer of the properties and shares into his sole
name or as he may direct. The case was argued on behalf of the husband
and the companies on the basis of the husbandÕs rights as against the

company. Apart from the alleged interests of the husbandÕs siblings,
which I have rejected, it has not been asserted that any other rights or
interests would or should inhibit me from making the orders sought by
the wife.

ÔÔ228. I also propose to deal speciÞcally with the position of Warwick
Avenue.
I am satisÞed that the moneys used in the purchase and
refurbishment of that property came from the husband. There is no
evidence that he lent this money to the company, nor that he gifted it to
the company. Accordingly, if it were necessary for me to decide the issue,
I would decide speciÞcally that the company holds that property on
resulting trust for the husband.ÕÕ

The appeals

87 I make Þrst some observations about section 24(1)(a) of the
Matrimonial Causes Act 1973.
It is a clear and uncomplicated provision.
The task that section 24(1)(a) sets the court is to identify ÔÔproperty to which
[the respondent spouse] is entitled, either in possession or reversionÕÕ, and
then to consider whether to make a property adjustment order in relation to
any property so identiÞed. The ÔÔpropertyÕÕ to which the paragraph refers
means property to which the respondent spouse is beneÞcially entitled. The
nature of the courtÕs inquiry as to the beneÞcial ownership of a particular
asset will be the same as it would be in a case not arising under the section 24
jurisdiction: ÔÔpropertyÕÕ for the purposes of section 24(1)(a) cannot and does
not mean something di›erent from ÔÔpropertyÕÕ in other contexts. The
inquiry will show that the asset in question either is, or is not, property of the
respondent spouse. If it is, it is vulnerable to the exercise of the section 24
jurisdiction. If it is not, it is not.

88 This takes me back to para 218 of the judgeÕs judgment. The judgeÕs
rejection there of the submission that the establishment of the Petrodel
structure involved any impropriety such as to entitle the court to pierce the
companiesÕ respective corporate veils was crucial to the disposition of the
inquiry as to the beneÞcial ownership of the assets held by the appellants.
The relevance of the ÔÔneed for improprietyÕÕ submission was that it was only
if relevant impropriety could be shown that the corporate veils could in
consequence be pierced, following which it would then be open to the court,
so far as it might think Þt, to treat certain of the companiesÕ assets as
the husbandÕs and make transfer orders in respect of
them under
section 24(1)(a).

89 The judge, however, rejected the submission that there had been any
relevant impropriety and instead found that the company structure ÔÔwas set
up and has been used for conventional reasons including wealth protection
and the avoidance of taxÕÕ. That can mean only that he was making a
conventional Þnding that the ÔÔwealthÕÕ of the companies (which I presume
means their assets) belonged beneÞcially to them. That is because, if he was
instead Þnding that their ÔÔwealthÕÕ had always belonged, and continued to
belong, not to the companies but exclusively to the husband, he could in
consequence only have found that the companies were mere nominees for
him, which would undermine his Þnding as to the legitimacy of the
establishment and use of the company structure. The judge underlined this
by noting that the husbandÕs use of the companies ÔÔe›ectively [as his] money
box . . . at willÕÕ might have been contrary to accounting or legal principles

' 2013 The Incorporated Council of Law Reporting for England and Wales

but that such use did not undermine the legitimacy of the establishment of
their structure. He was implicitly saying that the companies were entities
with assets of their own the use and disposal of which might be constrained
by law, as a companyÕs assets are; and that the husband, perhaps improperly,
had helped himself to their assets did not alter that.

90 The last sentence of at para 218 is more di–cult. The judge there
said that whilst ÔÔfrom the husbandÕs perspectiveÕÕ the companiesÕ ÔÔwealth
and corporate structure is and remains hisÕÕ, at the same time ÔÔhe is able to
take advantage of the tax and other beneÞts of holding it within a corporate
structureÕÕ. I am not conÞdent that I understand what the judge was saying
there. If he was saying that the companiesÕ ÔÔwealthÕÕ in fact belonged (and,
presumably, had always belonged) beneÞcially to the husband, it would
follow that the husband was not entitled to take advantage of the suggested
beneÞts of holding them within a corporate structure: the assets (and
liabilities) would, on that basis, have belonged to him alone, the companies
would simply have held the assets as his nominees and the incorporation of
the companies could have achieved no relevant change in his personal
position.
If, however, the judge was simply saying (as I regard more
probable, since otherwise para 218 would overall make no sense) that the
husband was, at least in substance, the sole beneÞcial owner of the shares in
the ultimate holding company and so had complete control of all the group
companies and their respective wealth, there is no problem. He would then
simply have been describing the commonplace circumstance under which
the one-man owner of a company, or a group of companies, enjoys total
control of its or their a›airs.

91 I therefore arrive at the judgeÕs para 220 on the basis that he has not
only made no Þnding that the assets held by the Petrodel companies were
other than assets that belonged to them beneÞcially (as a companyÕs assets
do) but has in fact found (in para 218) that they did so belong. In para 220
the judge focused on the question that section 24(1)(a) posed for him and
indicated that he derived guidance from Nicholas v Nicholas [1984] FLR
285 and Mubarak v Mubarak [2001] 1 FLR 673 as to how he should answer
it.

92 The judge then again explained, in paras 221—223, how the husband
had sole control of the Petrodel companies and how he exercised that control
by being their sole (shadow) director and how he was ÔÔthe e›ective owner of
the whole groupÕÕ (meaning, as I have said, that he had sole control of the
shares in the ultimate parent, the Nevis company). At the end of para 223,
he concluded that the combined facts of the husbandÕs complete control and
the fact that he was ÔÔthe sole e›ective ownerÕÕ equated to ÔÔbeneÞcial
ownershipÕÕ: and he was apparently there saying that those combined
circumstances made the husband the sole beneÞcial owner of the companiesÕ
assets. If he was not saying that, I do not know what he meant; if he was
saying it, his statement cannot stand with para 218.

93 In paras 224 and 225, the judge made clear his Þndings that the
husband was ÔÔentitledÕÕ to all the companiesÕ assets, and that Þnding
necessarily carried with it a Þnding that the husband was the exclusive
beneÞcial owner of such assets and that the companies had no beneÞcial
interest in them. The companies which, in para 218, the judge had found to
be legitimately established ÔÔfor conventional reasons including wealth

protection and the avoidance of taxÕÕ have, therefore, by para 225 become
the husbandÕs nominees or agents in respect of his own assets.

94 The judgeÕs conclusion to that e›ect was based on his holding that
the husbandÕs sole control of the companiesÕ a›airs gave him the beneÞcial
ownership of all the assets held by the companies. His view was that such a
sole shareholderÕs power over the assets of the company he owns is equal to
property.
It was his view that if (as in every case he will) a sole ultimate
shareholder of a group of companies is in a position to procure the transfer
to himself of any asset held by any of the companies, then, in ÔÔthe absence of
any third party interestsÕÕ, any such asset is property to which the sole
shareholder is ÔÔentitledÕÕ within the meaning of section 24(1)(a). The
corollary must be that it is not property to which the company is entitled or
in which the company has any beneÞcial interest: the company is, in such a
case, merely holding its assets as the nominee of its 100% controller.

95 The judge summarised his Þndings in para 226. His conclusion was
that the controller of a company who has the ÔÔright and abilityÕÕ to transfer
its assets to himself for his own use is ÔÔentitled in possessionÕÕ to the asset.
That does, the judge recognised, amount to treating the companyÕs assets as
the controllerÕs rather than the companyÕs. But he did not regard it as
amounting to a departure from the principles of Salomon v A Salomon & Co
Ltd [1897] AC 22 since section 24(1)(a) authorised such an inroad into the
Salomon principles. That last observation is a di–cult one. If, as the judge
appears to have considered, section 24(1)(a) is to be interpreted as meaning
that, in the case of a company in the sole ownership of a single individual, all
the assets of the company are ÔÔproperty to which [that individual] is
entitledÕÕ, that logically involves no inroad into the Salomon principles at all:
it simply means that the e›ect of section 24(1)(a) is that such a company
owns beneÞcially none of the assets it holds, which instead all belong
beneÞcially to its 100% owner. Such an interpretation, however, involves a
misunderstanding of section 24(1)(a) and is wrong.

96 In particular, if the judge regarded anything in Nicholas v Nicholas
[1984] FLR 285 and Mubarak v Mubarak [2001] 1 FLR 673 as supporting
his conclusion, he misunderstood them. Those cases had nothing to say
about the ordinary meaning of section 24(1)(a) and neither suggested that it
means anything other than I have indicated it means. The relevant
statements in the Nicholas and Mubarak cases were directed to a
consideration of the circumstances in which it might be appropriate for the
court to ÔÔpierce the corporate veilÕÕ of a company and then to treat its assets
as those of the husband for the purposes of section 24(1)(a). In the present
case, however, the judge appears to have regarded the guidance in Ben
Hashem v Al Shayif [2009] 1 FLR 115 as to when the corporate veil might be
pierced as the applicable guidance and held, in paras 218 and 219, that there
was no basis for piercing the veil. Such guidance di›ers from that in
Nicholas v Nicholas [1984] FLR 285 and Mubarak v Mubarak [2001]
1 FLR 673.

97 I respectfully disagree with the judgeÕs reasoning and conclusion.
Once he had rejected the submission that he could pierce the corporate veils
of the companies in the Petrodel group, he had no choice but to Þnd that
assets of PRL and Vermont, including the London properties the subject of
the appeals, belonged beneÞcially to PRL and/or Vermont respectively, and
that none of such assets belonged beneÞcially to the husband. The judgeÕs

di›erent conclusion that such properties were, or were ÔÔe›ectivelyÕÕ, the
husbandÕs property was based on reasoning that was internally inconsistent,
contrary to principle and wrong. I shall now explain why in fuller detail.

Basic principles

98 First, the appeals concern companies all incorporated in jurisdictions
other than England and Wales. There was, however, no expert evidence as
to any foreign law governing the operations of any of the companies and the
appeals were argued on the basis that English law applied to their
operations.

99 Second, Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd [1897] AC 22 provides the
highest authority for the principle that a duly incorporated company is a
legal entity wholly separate from those who incorporate it, with rights and
liabilities of its own; and there was here no suggestion that any of the group
companies was other than duly incorporated. The principle established by
the Salomon case is too well known to require elaboration. I shall cite just
two short passages. Lord Halsbury LC said, at p 31:

ÔÔEither the limited company was a legal entity or it was not. If it was,
the business belonged to it and not to Mr Salomon. If it was not, there
was no person and no thing to be an agent at all; and it is impossible to say
at the same time that there is a company and there is not.ÕÕ

Lord Macnaghten said, at p 53:

ÔÔIt has become the fashion to call companies of this class Ôone-man
companiesÕ. That is a taking nickname, but it does not help one much in
the way of argument.
If it is intended to convey the meaning that a
company which is under the absolute control of one person is not a
company legally incorporated, although the requirements of the 1862 Act
may have been complied with, it is inaccurate and misleading: if it merely
means that there is a predominant partner possessing an overwhelming
inßuence and entitled practically to the whole of the proÞts, there is
nothing in that that I can see contrary to the true intention of the
1862 Act, or against public policy, or detrimental to the interests of
creditors.ÕÕ
100 Third, as appears from the latter quotation, it makes no di›erence
to the fact of a companyÕs separate entity that a single individual controls all
its shares. That is, and always has been, a commonplace circumstance.
Companies can now be, and often are, incorporated with a single member.
At the time of SalomonÕs case, the minimum number was seven and the
Salomon company was incorporated with seven members, but the House
made plain that it makes no di›erence to the separate existence of the
company that all the shares are held in trust for one person who has full
control over it: (see again per Lord Macnaghten, and also per Lord
Herschell, at p 45, and per Lord Davey, at p 54.

101 Fourth, it follows from the fact of the companyÕs separate identity
that its property belongs beneÞcially to the company itself and in no sense
belongs, either at law or in equity, to its shareholders, who have no interest
of any nature, whether proprietary or otherwise, in its assets.
If they are
working members and are remunerated by the companies for their e›orts,
the money so paid to them will cease to be the companyÕs money and become

theirs; likewise if a dividend is lawfully declared and paid to them; and
likewise again if, upon liquidation, the surplus assets after paying the
creditors are divided between them. Until, however, any of such events
occurs, the money or property hitherto held by the company does not belong
to the shareholders but to the company. If authoritative support is required
for that, see Macaura v Northern Assurance Co Ltd [1925] AC 619, 626
where Lord Buckmaster said: ÔÔNow, no shareholder has any right to any
item of property owned by the company, for he has no legal or equitable
interest therein.ÕÕ He might equally have said ÔÔno shareholder is entitled
to any item of property . . .ÕÕ And Lord Wrenbury said, at p 633: ÔÔthe
corporator even if he holds all the shares is not the corporation, and . . .
neither he nor any creditor of the company has any property legal or
equitable in the assets of the corporation.ÕÕ (Emphasis supplied.) The latter
quotation has a particular resonance for present purposes.
That a
shareholder of company A, which in turns wholly owns company B, owns
none of the assets of either company was also recognised by the House of
Lords in British American Tobacco Co Ltd v Inland Revenue Comrs [1943]
AC 335: see p 339, per Viscount Simon LC. A companyÕs beneÞcial
ownership of its assets was similarly recognised by both Lords Justices in
Nicholas v Nicholas [1984] FLR 285 (the relevant dicta in that case, to
which I shall return, are as to when it may be appropriate to pierce a
companyÕs veil and to treat the assets as instead belonging to its controller)
and was again recognised by the same two judges in Crittenden v Crittenden
[1990] 2 FLR 361. For a recent recognition of the same principle, see In re
Coroin Ltd; McKillen v Misland (Cyprus) Investments Ltd [2012] BCLC
611, paras 50, 52 in a judgment of mine with which Tomlinson and
Lloyd LJJ agreed.

102 The judge noted in para 220 that ÔÔa lay personÕÕ might think that a
husband ÔÔwas entitledÕÕ to a house owned by a company that he owned.
A lay person might so think but he would be wrong. If the same lay person
carried on a business through a company of which he was the sole owner,
and caused the company to incur liabilities that it could not meet, he would
have no hesitation in asserting that the liabilities must be met exclusively by
the company (by recourse exclusively to its assets) and (provided his shares
were fully paid) had nothing to do with him personally. That is what limited
liability is about.

103 Fifth, whilst in the second sentence of para 224 the judge appears
rightly to have recognised that a shareholder has no interest in his companyÕs
assets, he went on to hold that this principle is trumped if the shareholderÕs
total control of the group empowers him to procure the transfer to himself of
a ÔÔparticular item of propertyÕÕ. The judge found that the husband held such
power, which meant, as the judge further held, that such item therefore
belonged to him not to the company.
It was not even necessary for the
husband Þrst to procure the exercise of the power: its mere existence meant
that the property belonged beneÞcially not to the company, but to the
husband.

104 With respect to the judge, his ÔÔpower equals propertyÕÕ reasoning is
wrong. It is heretical to suggest that the total control that a single individual
is (and will always be) entitled to exercise over the a›airs of his one-man
company is a feature resulting in the companyÕs assets becoming assets to
which he is ÔÔentitledÕÕ and, therefore, to which the company is not entitled.

ÔÔEntitlementÕÕ within the meaning of section 24(1)(a) can, as I have said,
only mean beneÞcially entitled (the paragraph cannot, for example, extend
to property vested in a spouse on trust for a third party). The logic of the
judgeÕs reasoning appears, therefore, to be that a one-man company can
never own assets beneÞcially but can only ever hold its assets as the nominee
of its sole controller. That is what Lord Wrenbury said is not the law.

105 The ßaw in the ÔÔpower equals propertyÕÕ approach is that it ignores
the fundamental principle that the only entity with the power to deal with
assets held by it is the company. Those who control its a›airsÑeven if the
control is in a single individualÑact merely as the companyÕs agents. Their
agency will include the authority to procure an exercise by the company of
its dispositive powers in respect of its property, but those powers are still
exclusively the companyÕs own: they are not the agentsÕ powers. When and
if the agents act as such, and procure a corporate disposition, the property
which immediately before the disposition belonged to the company will
become the property of the disponee. Until then, it remains the property of
the company and belongs beneÞcially to no one else. The judgeÕs point that
the agent is automatically the owner of all the companyÕs assets by the mere
fact of his authority to procure the company to dispose of them to himself is
astonishing and does not begin to pass muster. And why should it? The
proposition was simply the fruit of a judicial attempt to shoehorn into
section 24(1)(a) assets which manifestly do not Þt there. The judgeÕs Þnding
that the husbandÕs mastery of the companies meant that they and their assets
were his, and that they were the equivalent of mere nominees or agents for
him (see, for example, his para 225) could have been lifted directly from the
argument of counsel for the respondents that was rejected in Salomon v
A Salomon & Co Ltd [1897] AC 22, 28, 29.

106 That is probably all that needs to be said about the judgeÕs ÔÔpower
equals propertyÕÕ theory.
I shall, however, add a little more. A further
reason why the theory does not work is that the judge overlooked that even
the one-man in such a company does not have unlimited power to procure
the company to deal as he would wish with the companyÕs assets. He may in
practice be able to do so, by procuring the payment of its money and the
execution of corporate dispositions right, left and centre, all perhaps for
nothing in return. But he will not be able to do so lawfully. Even he will be
constrained by the capital maintenance provisions which limit such
wholesale disposals. He cannot, for example, lawfully procure the making
of distributions by the company save out of its distributable proÞts and, if he
does, the distribution will be unlawful and void. I discussed such problems
in Inn Spirit Ltd v Burns [2002] 2 BCLC 780, which concerned a one-man
corporate group, in which the one-man purported to pay himself a dividend.
The one-man is not in a position lawfully to distribute to himself the entirety
of his companyÕs assets at any time. To revert to the judgeÕs para 225, there
is a ÔÔlegal impedimentÕÕ to wholesale transfers by a company in favour of its
one-man controller. Only when the one-man lawfully procures the exercise
of the corporate power of disposition in his own favour is it possible to
identify which property has ceased to belong to the company and has
become his.

107 Further, the judge ignored that the companies he was dealing with
(at any rate PRL and Vermont) were trading companies. They became the
wealthy entities they did through commercial dealings with third parties,

and were apparently Þnanced by third party banks who took security for
their loans over the group assets. In the course of creating their corporate
wealth, the companies will have incurred liabilities to such third parties as
creditors. Taking PRL as an example, if the judgeÕs theory that ÔÔpower
equals propertyÕÕ is right, and all PRLÕs apparent assets in fact belonged
beneÞcially to the husband,
it would follow that during its trading
operations PRL would logically have been meeting its liabilities with the
husbandÕs money; and, if it ceased to do so and was put into creditorsÕ
liquidation by a dissatisÞed creditor, the husband would be entitled to assert
that none of its apparent remaining assets belonged to it, that they all
belonged to him and that there was therefore nothing available for the
creditors in the liquidation. Such a potential outcome is another absurd
consequence of the judgeÕs approach.
If the judge was right, third parties
would be unlikely ever to be willing to trade with one-man companies, since
such companies could never be more than mere nominees for the individual
who controls them, whoever that might be. The third parties would,
however, also face the problem that they would often not know whether any
particular company was or was not a one-man company, since they might
not know whether its control was enjoyed by a single individual.

108 How does the judgeÕs approach square with these considerations?
With whom did the judge consider the companiesÕ trading counterparties
were dealing? The companies? The husband? We were told at the hearing
of the appeals that separate judgment creditorsÕ petitions had been presented
in the Isle of Man against PRL by Mr Le Breton and Munin Navigation Co
Ltd: see Munin Navigation Co Ltd v Petrodel Resources Ltd [2012] EWCA
Civ 136 for an account of MuninÕs claim. As matters stand, the judge has
made a Þnding of fact, binding on PRL, to the e›ect that none of the assets
apparently held by PRL belongs to it beneÞcially. To what assets did he
consider its creditors would be entitled to look for repayment of their debts?
109 For these reasons, I conclude that the judge was wrong to hold that
the properties the subject of the para 5 orders belonged beneÞcially other
than to PRL and Vermont respectively. He should have held that the
husband had no beneÞcial interest in them and that they were therefore not
ÔÔproperty to which [he was] entitledÕÕ for the purposes of section 24(1)(a).

110 I turn to the family proceedings authorities. Some support for the
judgeÕs decision might be said to be found in certain of them, although the
judge did not deploy such support in the way he might have done.
In my
judgment, however, properly analysed, they provide no legitimate support.
Certain of them contain dicta that I would regard as incorrect and which
should not in future be followed or applied.

The family authorities

111 Perhaps the best support for the judgeÕs decision (but not his
reasoning) is in certain dicta in the judgments of this court in Nicholas v
Nicholas [1984] FLR 285 (Cumming-Bruce and Dillon LJJ). The husband
was the 71% shareholder in two companies, with the other 29% held by his
business associates. The wife sought a property adjustment order. One of
the companies owned a property, Elmwood, which had been used in part as
the matrimonial home and in part for commercial purposes. The judge
ordered the husband to undertake to procure the sale by the company of
Elmwood to the wife for approximately £105,000 and to pay £105,000 to

[2013] 2 AC

the wife to enable her to buy it. The husband declined to give the
undertaking and appealed against the order.

112 In contrast to the orders made by the judge in this case, the
Nicholas v Nicholas order did not, therefore, seek simply to divert a
companyÕs property to the wife for a nil return and so purport to conÞscate
its assets for her beneÞt. The judge instead fashioned an order whose
substance was that the husband was to buy Elmwood from the company at
full value for her beneÞt. The husbandÕs point on his appeal was that the
judge had no jurisdiction to make such an order.
In giving the Þrst
judgment, Cumming-Bruce LJ accepted that there was no jurisdiction to
order the husband to give the undertaking but said that deÞciency in the
order could be overcome by simply ordering the husband to use his
controlling vote in the company to achieve the sale. I do not understand on
what basis it was thought that the court could have so ordered (and it turned
out that there was none) but Cumming-Bruce LJ also explained how there
was anyway a further problem. He referred to section 24, the property
adjustment order section, and cited section 24(1)(a). He continued, so far as
material, at pp 287—288:

ÔÔOn the facts of the instant case, the property known as Elmwood . . .
is vested in the company which owns it, and a question arises whether,
having regard to the shareholdings in the two relevant companies . . . it is
proper for the court to pierce the corporate veil with the e›ect that though
the company is the legal owner of the realty the court would disregarded
[sic] the corporate ownership and make an order which, in e›ect, is an
order against the husband, the individual shareholder. Of course it is
quite clear, and there is abundant authority, that where the shareholding
is such that
the minority interests can for practical purposes be
disregarded, the court does and will pierce the corporate veil and make an
order which has the same e›ect as an order that would be made if the
property was vested in the majority shareholder. But in the instant case it
is not possible to take the view that the minority interests in either
company can be thus disregarded. The shareholdings . . . are of such a
character that the minority interests are real interests and it would not be
an appropriate case in which the court should exercise its power to pierce
the corporate veil. That being so, as . . . Elmwood is vested in the
company and the companyÕs ownership has to be respected, is it an
appropriate use of the power to order a lump sum under section 23 to add
to the order for a lump sum an obligation imposed upon the husband to
procure the transfer by the company of the companyÕs property to the
wife by way of sale, the purchase money being the sum ordered by way of
lump sum?

ÔÔI am satisÞed that, although I perfectly understand the reasons that
led the judge to take the view that such an order, made as he thought by
way of undertaking, should be made, having regard to the terms of
section 24 when read with the terms of section 23(1)(c) [which empowers
the court to order the payment of a lump sum], it is not open to the court
to supplement the express powers speciÞed in section 23(1)(c) and
section 24(1) in such a way as to exercise an inherent power, the e›ect of
which will be to force a third party, to wit the company, to sell property
vested in the company by way of sale to the petitioner. The di–culty,

I feel, is that Parliament has in section 24(1)(a) speciÞcally limited the
property that shall be the subject of a property adjustment order and has
limited it to property which is property to which the Þrst-mentioned party
is entitled in possession or reversion. Clearly, no order could be made in
respect of Elmwood, the companyÕs property, pursuant to section 24.
Section 23 is in terms drafted in such a way as to limit it simply to the
obligation to pay a lump sum. I am unable to hold that I can collect from
section 23, when read with section 24, any power to order, as ancillary to
an order for a lump sum, an order imposing an obligation upon a
respondent to procure that a third party in whom the property is
beneÞcially vested to divest itself of that property by way of sale to a
petitioning wife, whether the machinery be by exercise of the majority
shareholderÕs voting power or otherwise.

ÔÔFor those reasons, though with reluctance, I take the view that there
was no power to make the order that the judge made in respect of the
transfer of Elmwood, whether by way of undertaking which, as I have
already explained, was not an appropriate form of order, or by way of a
direct order ordering the respondent to use his controlling vote in [the
relevant company] to cause the sale of the companyÕs property to the
petitioner. For those reasons I would hold that that very important
feature of the judgeÕs order should be varied.ÕÕ
113 Cumming-Bruce LJ then engaged in a discussion as to whether the
court should vary the lump sum order of £105,000, none of which is
material. Dillon LJ said, at pp 292—293, that he entirely agreed and, so far as
material, continued:

ÔÔthe case as presented in this court is presented on a signiÞcantly
di›erent basis from the case as understood by the judge. He plainly
understood, as did counsel for the wife, that the husband was prepared to
undertake, if the judge took the view that Elmwood should be transferred
to the wife, that the husband would use his controlling interest in [the
relevant company], to achieve such a transfer against payment by the wife
of the sum which the husband would provide by way of lump sum
payment. On that understanding it is not surprising that he made the
order he did. But it is now clear that there was no authority in counsel to
o›er any undertaking to the court and no undertaking has been given.
Therefore, it is a question whether the court has power to order the
husband to transfer the property to the wife against the payment of
£105,000, the property being vested in the company and not in the
husband himself. If the company was a one-man company and the alter
ego of the husband, I would have no di–culty in holding that there was
power to order a transfer of the property, but that is not this case. The
evidence shows that the husband only has a 71% interest in the company.
The remaining 29% is held by individuals who . . . are not nominees but
business associates of the husband . . . I Þnd it quite impossible, therefore,
to ignore the corporate entity of [the company]. Therefore the order the
judge made cannot stand.ÕÕ
114 Both judgments in Nicholas v Nicholas [1984] FLR 285 correctly
recognised the existence of the separate legal personalities of the company
that owned Elmwood and the husband and, therefore, that Elmwood was

not the latterÕs property which could be the subject of an order under
section 24(1)(a). For reasons that Cumming-Bruce LJ explained, with which
Dillon LJ agreed, there was no jurisdiction in the court to make either the
order the judge had made or a modiÞed order to like e›ect requiring the
husband to procure the sale of Elmwood to the wife. The present
importance of the case lies, however, in the indication by both judges that:
(i) (per Cumming-Bruce LJ, at p 287) in a case in which the husband is the
majority shareholder in the company holding the relevant asset, and

ÔÔthe minority interests in the company can for practical purposes be
disregarded, the court does and will pierce the corporate veil and make an
order which has the same e›ect as an order that would be made if the
property was vested in the majority shareholderÕÕ;

and (ii) (per Dillon LJ, at p 292):

ÔÔIf the company was a one-man company and the alter ego of the
husband, I would have no di–culty in holding that there was power to
order a transfer of the property, but that is not this case.ÕÕ

Cumming-Bruce LJ asserted that there was ÔÔabundant authorityÕÕ for his
proposition. He did not, however, refer to any, the report recorded none as
cited and during the overnight adjournment of the hearing of this appeal
counsel identiÞed no reported authority to which they considered he might
have been referring.

115 The judge took the view (at para 219) that the observations by
Cumming-Bruce and Dillon LJJ to which I have just referred were obiter and
In Hope v Krejci [2012] EWHC 1780 (Fam) at [27],
I agree with him.
Mostyn J said he was not so sure, expressing the view that ÔÔthe reasoning
went to the very core of the decision not to pierce the corporate veilÕÕ.
I recognise that the opening words of my quotation from Cumming-
Bruce LJÕs judgment (ÔÔa question arises . . .ÕÕ) might suggest that there was
an issue in the appeal as to whether or not the veil could be pierced. I do not,
however, understand that there was. The order under appeal was not a ÔÔveil
piercingÕÕ order: it was not premised on any basis other than that Elmwood
was an asset beneÞcially owned by the company. The order was directed at
achieving its sale to the wife for full value and the issue on the appeal was
whether there was jurisdiction to make such an order. There is no
suggestion that it became part of the wifeÕs case in the Court of Appeal by a
cross-appeal that the court could achieve a like result as that intended by the
judgeÕs order by piercing the corporate veil and making a direct transfer
order, and such a case would, on the facts, have been hopeless. The courtÕs
decision was simply that there was no jurisdiction to make the type of order
the judge had made and it had nothing to do with the circumstances in which
the court can ÔÔpierce the veilÕÕ. In my view, the observations (per Cumming-
Bruce LJ) as to ÔÔveil piercingÕÕ or (per Dillon LJ) as to the company being the
husbandÕs alter ego were obiter.

116 I interpret those observations as simply indicating the Lords
JusticesÕ views that, in a case in which the husband is, either actually or in
substance, the 100% owner of a company that owns an asset that might
usefully be applied in or towards satisfaction of a wifeÕs ancillary relief
claim, it will or may be open to the court to pierce the companyÕs corporate
veil and then treat that asset as property of the husband so as to enable it to

be the subject of a section 24(1)(a) order. Mr Todd, for the wife, disagreed
with that analysis and submitted that it was not what the Lords Justices were
saying. Despite Cumming-Bruce LJÕs express reference to ÔÔveil piercingÕÕ
(which Mr Todd invited us to disregard), he said that both Lords JusticesÕ
respective observations were directed simply at applying a broad
language of section 24(1)(a), and that
interpretation to the relevant
submission perhaps reßected the judgeÕs own understanding of them. They
were, Mr Todd said, saying that property owned by a company of which the
husband is, actually or in substance, the 100% owner is property to which
the husband is ÔÔentitledÕÕ within the meaning of section 24(1)(a), whereas
property owned by a company in which the husband has less than a 100%
interest, and in which other shareholders have material shareholdings of
their own, is not property to which the husband is so ÔÔentitledÕÕ.

117 I respectfully reject that submission. There is no support for it in
either judgment in Nicholas v Nicholas [1984] FLR 285, nor does it bear any
sort of reasoned analysis.
In essence, it amounts to an attribution to the
Lords Justices in the Nicholas case of an adoption of Moylan JÕs approach
that the 100% controller of a company is beneÞcially entitled to property
held by it, whereas a company whose control is split between two or more
shareholders with independent interests will itself be the beneÞcial owner of
such property. The suggestion that the beneÞcial entitlement to property
held by a company will vary according to the number of controllers of its
shares is absurd and neither Lord Justice in the Nicholas case was saying
anything of the sort. All that they were sayingÑand Cumming-Bruce LJ
used the very phraseÑwas that in a case in which a company is wholly
owned by a husband, it will or may be open to the court to ÔÔpierce the
corporate veilÕÕ; and, having done so, by inference then to treat the property
held by the company as belonging to him so as to enable it to be subjected to
a section 24(1)(a) order. I say ÔÔby inferenceÕÕ, because neither judge so spelt
it out. But the inference must be right because the whole point of ÔÔveil
piercingÕÕ is to identify the company with its controller. That is manifestly
what Cumming-Bruce LJ was saying; and, although Dillon LJ did not also
expressly refer to ÔÔveil piercingÕÕ, he did refer to the company as an alter ego
of the husband, another traditional way of referring to the same concept.

118 I therefore reject Mr ToddÕs submission as to the sense of the dicta
Section 24(1)(a) cannot bite on a companyÕs
in Nicholas v Nicholas.
it can only bite on the husbandÕs, and both Lords Justices
property,
recognised that. The critical question raised by the Nicholas case is,
however, whether they were right in their respective dicta as to how recourse
to ÔÔveil piercingÕÕ might enable the circumnavigation of that obstacle in the
path of a wife whose ancillary relief sights are set on an asset held by a
company. That is a central question raised by these appeals and I shall
shortly return to it.

119 We were also referred to Crittenden v Crittenden [1990] 2 FLR
361, also a decision of this court (by coincidence, also of Dillon LJ and Sir
Roualeyn Cumming-Bruce).
It is necessary only to cite from Dillon LJÕs
judgment, with which Sir Roualeyn Cumming-Bruce agreed. Dillon LJ said,
at p 364:

ÔÔThe sections relied on by Mr Turner for the imposition of such a
restriction are sections 24A and 37 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973.

Section 24A is concerned with the position where the court is considering
ordering a sale of property. Subsection (1) provides: ÔWhere the court
makes under section 23 or 24 of this Act a secured periodical payments
order, an order for the payment of a lump sum or a property adjustment
order, then, on making that order or at any time thereafter, the court may
make a further order for the sale of such property as may be speciÞed in
the order, being property in which or in the proceeds of sale of which
either or both of the parties to the marriage has or have a beneÞcial
interest, either in possession or reversion.Õ That wording can relate to the
shares in the company, Somerton Marine Ltd, which are owned in their
own right by Mr or Mrs Crittenden, but it cannot relate to the assets of
Somerton Marine Ltd.ÕÕ
120 The point that Dillon LJ was making was that whilst the shares in
the company owned respectively by Mr and Mrs Crittenden were ÔÔpropertyÕÕ
in which they had a beneÞcial interest, they had no such interest in the assets
of the company and therefore no sale order in respect of such assets could be
made. Dillon LJ was simply recognising the trite principle that a companyÕs
assets belong beneÞcially to the company and not to its shareholders. It was
suggested to us in argument that Dillon LJ was there departing from his
obiter remarks in the Nicholas case and that, in agreeing with him, Sir
Roualeyn Cumming-Bruce was departing from his own obiter remarks in the
Nicholas case.
In the Nicholas case, Sir Roualeyn Cumming-
Bruce made clear that the core principle is that a section 24(1)(a) order
cannot be made in respect of a companyÕs property and Dillon LJ agreed.
Both Lords Justices, albeit expressing themselves di›erently, also uttered the
dicta to the e›ect that, in a one-man company case, recourse to ÔÔveil
piercingÕÕ may enable a departure from the core principle that ordinarily
applies. The court in the Crittenden case was not implicitly asserting that
there was no scope for any ÔÔveil piercingÕÕ exception to the core principle.
All it was doing was to refer to that principle without also referring to any
exception to it. We are still left with the question of the correctness of the
dicta in Nicholas v Nicholas [1984] FLR 285. I turn to that question.

I disagree.

121 The di–culty that the dicta pose is this. SalomonÕs case [1897] AC
22 shows that a duly incorporated company (including a ÔÔone-man
companyÕÕ) is a legal entity separate from its members, with rights and
liabilities of its own. Its assets belong beneÞcially to it, and it alone, and its
members have no interest in them. This follows from the formal distinction
between a company and its members, a distinction that applies equally to a
one-man company and its controller. The Þrst problem with the Nicholas
dicta is that the court was saying that, in the case of a one-man company, its
corporate identity can be ignored and its assets treated as belonging not to it
but to the one man. That was apparently a heretical departure from the
Salomon principle. On what basis could the Nicholas case endorse it?

122 As to that, it has also long been recognised that there may be
circumstances in which it will be legitimate for the court to ÔÔpierce the
corporate veilÕÕ of a company, as it has come to be called, thereby identify the
company with those in control of it and, in its discretion, then to depart from
the separate identity principle established in SalomonÕs case. In such a case,
the court may then be prepared to grant remedies against the company
which, apart from any such veil piercing, might otherwise appear to be

available only against those controlling it; or to grant remedies against the
controllers which might otherwise appear to be available only against the
company.

123 In my preceding sentence, I was substantially quoting from para 47
of the judgment of the court delivered by Lloyd LJ in the Court of AppealÕs
decision earlier this year in VTB Capital plc v Nutritek International Corpn
[2012] 2 LloydÕs Rep 313 (the court also comprising Aikens LJ and myself ).
That case concerned a commercial dispute that raised several issues, one of
which related to the courtÕs jurisdiction to pierce the corporate veil and the
e›ect and consequences of doing so. The issues were far removed from those
of the present case but the importance of the judgment in the VTB case is
that it recognised and a–rmed the strict limitations identiÞed in prior
authority as to the only factual circumstances in which it will be open to the
court to ÔÔpierce the veilÕÕ. Thus it noted, at para 48, the unanimous (albeit
obiter) view of the House of Lords in Woolfson v Strathclyde Regional
Council 1978 SC (HL) 90, 96, that ÔÔit is appropriate to pierce the corporate
veil only where special circumstances exist indicating that it is a mere faade
concealing the true factsÕÕ (emphasis supplied). That limitation was
expressly recognised by the judgment of this court in Adams v Cape
Industries plc [1990] Ch 433, 539D—E, and the court had there also earlier
said, at p 536G:

ÔÔsave in cases which turn on the wording of particular statutes or
contracts, the court is not free to disregard the principle of Salomon v
A Salomon & Co Ltd [1897] AC 22 merely because it considers that
justice so requires.ÕÕ
124 A decision not referred to in the VTB case, but to which we were
and which it is convenient to notice, is that of this court in Ord v Belhaven
Pubs Ltd [1998] 2 BCLC 447. That was a commercial case in which the
issue was whether, in a case in which the defendant company was perceived
as having insu–cient assets to meet the claim, it was open to the court to
substitute as defendants its parent company and another subsidiary which
had taken over its trading operations. The judge had held that it was, relying
in part on the view that it was open to her to lift the defendantÕs corporate
veil and so enable the claim to be directed against the proposed new
defendants. Hobhouse LJ, in a judgment with which Brooke LJ and Sir John
Balcombe agreed, held that the judge was wrong. He said, at p 457, that she
had approached the case on the basis that it was open to her to regard the
companies as one economic unit and to disregard the distinction between
them and then to say:

ÔÔsince the company cannot pay, the shareholders who are the people
Þnancially interested should be made to pay instead. That of course is
radically at odds with the whole concept of corporate personality and
limited liability and the decision of the House of Lords in Salomon v
A Salomon & Co Ltd [1897] AC 22.ÕÕ

Hobhouse LJ then referred to WoolfsonÕs case in the House of Lords and
quoted, as I have, from Lord Keith (in [1998] 2 BCLC 447, the quotation is
erroneously included as part of Hobhouse LJÕs own words); and he referred
to the Court of AppealÕs decision in the Adams case as showing that ÔÔthere
must be some impropriety before the corporate veil can be piercedÕÕ. He held

that as the plainti›s could not show the establishment of a faade concealing
the true facts, or any other relevant impropriety, they could not satisfy the
conditions for piercing the veil and the judge had been wrong to pierce it.
That reasoning was, I consider, part of the ratio of the courtÕs decision as to
why the judge had been wrong to make the decision she did. Sir John
Balcombe, with his experience of both commercial and family law, did not
qualify his agreement with Hobhouse LJ by indicating that di›erent
principles applied in family cases.

125 Having digressed to OrdÕs case, I return to the cases referred to in
the VTB case as identifying the limitations upon the exercise of the veil
piercing jurisdiction. Trustor AB v Smallbone (No 2) [2001] 1 WLR 1177
was a case in which, after referring to (amongst other cases) the Woolfson
and Adams cases, Sir Andrew Morritt V-C said, at para 23, that

ÔÔthe court is entitled to Ôpierce the corporate veilÕ and recognise the
receipt of the company as that of the individual(s) in control of it if the
company was used as a device or faade to conceal the true facts thereby
avoiding or concealing any liability of those individual(s)).ÕÕ

I shall now set out the material parts of what the court in the VTB case
[2012] 2 LloydÕs Rep 313, paras 78—80 said about the next key authority, a
decision in family proceedings:

ÔÔ78. Ben Hashem v Shayif [2009] 1 FLR 115 is a judgment of Munby J
that includes between paras 144 and 221 a comprehensive discussion of
the principles by reference to which the court may pierce the veil of
incorporation. Between paras 159 and 164 Munby J restated the
principles, which he summarised as follows. First, ownership and control
of a company are not themselves su–cient to justify piercing the veil.
Second, the court cannot pierce the veil, even when no unconnected third
party is involved, merely because it is perceived that to do so is necessary
in the interests of justice. Third, the corporate veil can only be pierced
when there is some impropriety. Fourth, the companyÕs involvement in
an impropriety will not by itself justify a piercing of its veil: the
impropriety Ômust be linked to use of the company structure to avoid or
conceal liabilityÕ (a principle derived from Trustor). Fifth, it follows that
if the court is to pierce the veil, it is necessary to show both control of the
company by the wrongdoer and impropriety in the sense of a misuse of
the company as a device or faade to conceal wrongdoing. Sixth, a
company can be a faade for such purposes even though not incorporated
with deceptive intent: Ô164 . . . The question is whether it is being used as
a faade at the time of the relevant transaction(s). And the court will
pierce the veil only so far as is necessary to provide a remedy for the
particular wrong which those controlling the company have done.
In
other words, the fact that the court pierces the veil for one purpose does
not mean that it will necessarily be pierced for all purposes.Õ

ÔÔ79. Mr Snowden accepted that summary as a correct statement of the
principles save that he questioned the correctness of the Þnal principle, as
to a requirement of necessity, as he also questioned the correctness of
Warren JÕs like point in [Dadourian Group International Inc v Simms
[2009] 1 LloydÕs Rep 601]. He said that it does not follow that a piercing
of the veil will be available only if there is no other remedy available

against the wrongdoers for the wrong they have committed. In principle,
we agree with Mr SnowdenÕs suggested qualiÞcation . . . With that
qualiÞcation, we would, however, respectfully agree with Munby JÕs
summary of the principles.

ÔÔ80. Mr Snowden also submitted, in expansion of Munby JÕs fourth
principle (and reliance on what Munby J said at para 199) that it is not
su–cient for veil piercing purposes merely to show that the company is
involved in wrongdoing, for example that it is carrying out a fraud: there
will be no question in such a case of the company being used as a faade.
The relevant wrongdoing must be in the nature of an independent wrong
that involves the fraudulent or dishonest misuse of the corporate
personality of the company for the purpose of concealing the true facts.
In principle, we agree with that too.ÕÕ
126 The VTB case thus provided this courtÕs a–rmation, drawing on
earlier judgments of the House of Lords, the Court of Appeal (to which it
could usefully have included a reference to OrdÕs case), the Chancery
Division and the Family Division, of the strict limits as to the exercise of the
courtÕs jurisdiction to pierce a companyÕs corporate veil so as to enable it to
disregard the separate corporate identity of a company and, instead, to
identify it with its controllers. The decision showed that what is required is
nothing less than proof of impropriety directed at the misuse of the
corporate structure for the purpose of concealing wrongdoing. The judge in
the present case did not have the advantage of the decision in the VTB case
(either at Þrst instance, per Arnold J [2011] EWHC 3107 (Ch), or in the
Court of Appeal [2012] 2 LloydÕs Rep 313). He did, however, have the
beneÞt of Munby JÕs decision in Ben Hashem v Al Shayif [2009] 1 FLR 115,
which was in all material respects approved by this court in the VTB case,
and, in para 217, he referred, as I have said, to the submissions made to him
that he could not make orders against the shares or properties ÔÔunless I Þnd
the requisite impropriety as set out in Ben HashemÕs case [2009] 1 FLR
115ÕÕ. He therefore directed himself correctly as to the conditions that must
be satisÞed before the court could pierce the veil of the Petrodel group
companies and he rejected the submission that there had been any relevant
impropriety. He found, therefore, that there was, for example, no question
of the relevant properties having originally been beneÞcially owned by the
husband and put into corporate names for the improper purpose of defeating
the wifeÕs claims in her Þnancial provision application. He found, by the
application of criteria since a–rmed in this court, that there was no factual
basis upon which it was open to the court to pierce the corporate veil of any
of the Petrodel companies.

127 With that discussion of the criteria for a judicial piercing of a
corporate veil, I return to the dicta in Nicholas v Nicholas [1984] FLR 285.
Both Lords Justices indicated their views that, if the respondent to an
application for a property adjustment order is a husband with sole control of
a one-man company, there is no di–culty in treating the companyÕs assets as
his property for the purpose of meeting any such application. They were
apparently saying that the total control of a company in the husband is by
itself enough to entitle the court to pierce its veil and treat its assets as the
husbandÕs.

128 The legal basis for those assertions is unclear. There was an
assumption in the argument before us that the ÔÔabundant authorityÕÕ to
which Cumming-Bruce LJ was referring was unreported authority in the
Family Division, although he did not say so and unreported authority is
anyway hardly authority. It is also improbable that Dillon LJ would have
been so basing his own dicta: he had, by September 1983, been a Lord
Justice for a year and before that his experience was made up of 31 years as a
practitioner at the Chancery Bar and three years as a judge of the Chancery
Division.

129 Whilst neither side suggested it to us, I regard it as probable that
Cumming-Bruce LJ, and also Dillon LJ, were basing themselves on (inter
alia) dicta falling from Lord Denning MR in Wallersteiner v Moir [1974]
1 WLR 991. Cumming-Bruce LJ was later to refer to them in In re
A Company [1985] BCLC 333, when delivering the judgment of this court
(himself and Hollings J). He said, at pp 337—338:

ÔÔIn our view the cases before and after Wallersteiner v Moir [1974]
1 WLR 991 show that the court will use its powers to pierce the corporate
veil if it is necessary to achieve justice irrespective of the legal e–cacy of
the corporate structure under consideration. As Lord Denning MR said
[at p 1013], the companies identiÞed were distinct legal entities and the
principles of Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd [1897] AC 22 prima facie
applied. But only prima facie. On the facts of the Wallersteiner case, the
companies danced to Dr WallersteinerÕs bidding. Buckley LJ disagreed on
the facts about the position of IFT, but Scarman LJ held that the evidence
disclosed liability in Wallersteiner on the ground that he instigated the
loan of £50,000.ÕÕ
130 The di–culty with that, however, is that Lord Denning MRÕs dicta
in relation to veil piercing (as similarly also advanced by him in Littlewoods
Mail Order Stores Ltd v McGregor [1969] 1 WLR 1241, 1254) were the
subject of consideration by this court in the later decision Adams v Cape
Industries plc [1990] Ch 433, 543, where the court said that

ÔÔin Wallersteiner v Moir [1974] 1 WLR 991 Buckley LJ, at p 1027, and
Scarman LJ, at p 1032, expressly declined to tear away the corporate veil.
In the Littlewoods case [1969] 1 WLR 1241, 1255, Sachs LJ expressly
disassociated himself from the suggestion that the subsidiary was not a
separate legal entity and Karminiski LJ refrained from associating himself
with it. We therefore think that the plainti›s can derive little support
from those dicta of Lord Denning MR.ÕÕ
131 In re A Company [1985] BCLC 333 was not apparently referred to
in the Adams case, but following the Woolfson, Adams and VTB cases, it is,
I consider, clear, as Mr Amos submitted, that the opening sentence of the
quoted statement in In re A Company cannot be regarded as the law. Nor
does the mere fact that a company dances to its sole controllerÕs bidding
entitle the court, without more, to equate the company with that controller
(Moylan J also referred, at para 221, to Lord Denning MRÕs dicta in
Wallersteiner v Moir as if it provided a key to the case). Mr Todd advanced
no argument in support of the approach adopted by the court in In re
A Company and the tide of authority is now solidly against it.

132 In my judgment, the dicta in Nicholas v Nicholas [1984] FLR 285
cannot stand with: (i) the prior House of Lords guidance in the Woolfson
case 1978 SC (HL) 90 as to the only circumstance in which a judicial
piercing of the corporate veil is appropriate, or (ii) with the subsequent
adoption of that approach by the Court of Appeal in the Adams case [1990]
Ch 433 and the Ord case [1998] 2 BCLC 447, or (iii) with the Þrst three
principles identiÞed by Munby J in Ben HashemÕs case [2009] 1 FLR 115,
and accepted as correct by this court in the VTB case [2012] 2 LloydÕs Rep
313, as to the preconditions of a veil-piercing exercise. Whilst Nicholas v
Nicholas was not cited in the Adams or VTB cases, there is no basis on
which its dicta can be defended as establishing a separate, freestanding,
legitimate principle of English law. They involve a head-on disregard of
Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd [1897] AC 22. They were not advanced on
the basis that they were directed at a special type of case justifying special
treatment.
In any particular case, an inability on the part of the court to
make a property adjustment order in relation to property held by the
husbandÕs company rather than by the husband himself may be perceived as
producing the potential for injustice; but the Adams case made clear that, by
itself, such a consideration is no basis for assuming a jurisdiction to pierce
the corporate veil: the court cannot disregard the Salomon case ÔÔmerely
because it considers that justice so requiresÕÕ. The husband and his company
are separate legal persons and each owns his and its separate assets. Those
di›erences must be respected and cannot be ignored merely because it is
perceived as convenient to do so. A condition of the accepted basis for a
piercing of the corporate veil is that the controller of the company has
misused the fact of its separate corporate identify for the purpose of hiding
facts or concealing wrongdoing. The rationale is that a wrongdoer cannot
beneÞt from his dishonest misuse of a corporate structure for improper
purposes. There was no suggestion in Nicholas v Nicholas [1984] FLR 285
that any such condition must be met before the veil could be pierced. The
dicta were, in my judgment, wrong and should not be followed.

133 In fact, they have been followed. In Green v Green [1993] 1 FLR
326, Connell J considered (I do not understand why) that there was a conßict
between the dicta in the Nicholas case and the decision in CrittendenÕs case
but regarded the former as providing the key to his case and decided it on the
basis that the husband was to be equated with the company of which he was
the 100% owner so that an order for sale could be made of its land. Connell
JÕs reasoning does not further the discussion. He just took the Nicholas dicta
at face value and applied them. He did, however, note, at p 340, that the
dicta reßected a practice that his own experience told him had been followed
for some time (without, though, referring to any reported authority
reßecting it).

134 In Wicks v Wicks [1999] Fam 65, this court overruled Green v
Green on the basis that the court had no jurisdiction to make the order it did.
The ratio of the decision did not, however, turn on Connell JÕs decision that,
following the Nicholas case (to which the court did not refer), he could
ÔÔpierce the corporate veilÕÕ; and only Peter Gibson LJ referred to that. He
said, at p 89:

ÔÔI Þnd it di–cult to see how the application for ancillary relief in Green
v Green [1993] 1 FLR 326 could have been said to relate to land when the

[2013] 2 AC

husband merely owned shares in the two companies which owned land.
I can well understand Connell JÕs desire to Þnd a solution so that the
petitioner and her child could be provided with a home, but I do not think
that the court had power in that case to order a sale of the land.ÕÕ
135 W v H (Family Division: Without Notice Orders) [2001] 1 All ER
300 was a decision of Munby J. The wife obtained an ex parte injunction
against B Co and X restraining the disposition of a property owned by B Co,
the shares of which were said to have been held on trust for the wife,
husband and children. X claimed to have bought the shares from the
husband but the wife asserted that the sale had been a sham. The report is
about the inter partes hearing at which X and B Co sought the setting aside
of the injunction. Munby J held that it should be continued. The
importance of the decision lies in his observations at pp 310—311:

ÔÔI ought to deal with a wider question canvassed by Mr Everall
[counsel for the wife]. This relates to the approach to be adopted in the
Family Division in cases where assets which a wife says belong in truth
and reality to her husband are, or appear to be, vested in some other
person, or in some corporate or trust entity.

ÔÔMr Everall, referring me to Nicholas v Nicholas [1984] FLR 285,
Green v Green [1993] 1 FLR 326, Purba v Purba [2000] 1 FCR 652 and
Khreino v Khreino (No 2) [2000] 1 FCR 80, submits that the court adopts
a robust approach in such cases and does not allow itself to be, to use
Thorpe LJÕs words in KhreinoÕs case (at p 85), emasculated by over-
reÞned or technical arguments based on strict principles of property law.

ÔÔI readily accept that there is much force in Mr EverallÕs submission.
Thus, as can be seen from NicholasÕs case (at pp 287, 292) and
GreenÕscase (at pp 337, 340), where property is vested in a one-man
company which is the alter ego of the husband, the Family Division will
pierce the corporate veil, disregard the corporate ownership and, without
requiring the company to be joined as a party, make an order which has
the same e›ect as the order that would be made if the property was vested
in the husband. Indeed, the court can and will adopt this approach even
where there are minority interests involved if they are such that they can
for practical purposes be disregarded.

ÔÔMoreover, as Thorpe LJÕs forthright observations in PurbaÕs case (at
pp 654—655), and KhreinoÕs case (at p 85), show, the court will not allow
itself to be bamboozled by husbands who put their property in the names
of close relations in circumstances where, taking a realistic and fair view,
it is apparent that the recipient is a bare trustee and where the answer to
the real questionÑWhose property is it?Ñis that it remains the husbandÕs
property. Again, in such cases there is no need for the third party to be
joined. As PurbaÕs case shows, where a transfer has been made post-
separation to a close relative in order to defeat a wifeÕs claims, the court
can and will act without going through the formality of joining the third
party or making setting aside orders under section 37. And as KhreinoÕs
case shows, the court can and in appropriate cases will grant Mareva
injunctions against both the husband and his o›shore company and the
relative who holds the bearer shares in the company without requiring
either the company or the relative to be joined as parties.

ÔÔNothing that I say should be taken as intended to water down in any
way the robustness with which the Family Division ought to deal in
appropriate cases with husbands who seek to obfuscate or to hide or
mask the reality behind shams, artiÞcial devices and similar contrivances.
Nor do I doubt for a moment the propriety and utility of treating as one
and the same a husband and some corporate or trust structure which it is
apparent is simply the alter ego or the creature of the husband. On the
other hand, and as NicholasÕs case itself demonstrates, the court does
notÑin my judgment cannot properlyÑadopt this robust approach
where, for example, property is held by a company in which, although the
husband has a majority shareholding, the minority shareholdings are
what Cumming-Bruce LJ [1984] FLR 285, 287 called Ôreal interestsÕ held
by individuals who, as Dillon LJ (at p 292) put it, are not nominees but
business associates of the husband.ÕÕ
136 I have no di–culty with much of that.

If property held by a
husband has been put into the name of someone who, on the evidence, is
obviously a bare trustee for him, there will be no problem in holding that the
beneÞcial ownership has not changed. As explained in the Þrst sentence of
the last quoted paragraph, the court will also not be bamboozled by the use
by husbands to a like end of ÔÔshams, artiÞcial devices and similar
contrivancesÕÕ. The more di–cult part of the quotation is in its third
paragraph and the remainder of the last paragraph, which reßect unqualiÞed
acceptance of the proposition, drawn from the Nicholas case, of the courtÕs
jurisdictionÑin the absence of any relevant improprietyÑto equate a one-
man company with the one-man and treat its assets as his. No reasoned
justiÞcation for doing so was advanced, any more than in the Nicholas case.
The only implicit justiÞcation is that family justice requires it. That, without
more, is no justiÞcation. Why should family justice be regarded as di›erent
from any other sort of justice? No one would suggest that an unsatisÞed
creditor of the owner of a one-man company could look to the assets of the
company to meet his debt, even though he might be able to look to the
ownerÕs shares in the company (as a wife can on her ancillary relief
application). Since I consider that the dicta in the Nicholas case were wrong,
I also consider, with respect, that Munby JÕs acceptance of them as correct
was wrong. He was not, however, apparently referred to the authorities as
to the limitations upon the courtÕs ability to pierce the corporate veil.

137 The next authority, decided shortly after W v H, is Bodey JÕs
decision in Mubarak v Mubarak [2001] 1 FLR 673. The question was
whether the wife was entitled to enforce a lump sum payment order by
recourse to assets held by one or other company in the ultimate control of
the husband. The companies opposed the order. Bodey J said there were
two strands of authority: those decided in the company/commercial sphere
and those decided in the family sphere. The former strand, upon which the
companies relied, was based on the recognition of a company as a separate
legal entity, distinct from its shareholders, with assets belonging to it alone, a
strand based on the Salomon case. Whilst it admitted of circumstances in
which the veil could be pierced, the principle of most general application
was that a company will be not allowed to be used as a device or sham to
evade obligations and Bodey J referred to Gilford Motor Co Ltd v Horne
[1933] Ch 935 and Jones v Lipman [1962] 1 WLR 832, which provide good

[2013] 2 AC

examples of the sort of impropriety that is required. The companiesÕ counsel
submitted that there was no suggestion of any misuse of them in the instant
case and that the Adams case showed that ÔÔno principle exists where, if
reliance on the strict technicalities would produce injustice, then the veil of
incorporation can, without more, be liftedÕÕ.

138 Turning to the family cases, Bodey J referred to the Nicholas,
Crittenden, Green and Wicks cases. He then said [2001] 1 FLR 673,
681—682:

ÔÔDrawing all these authorities together, the precise extent of the
Family DivisionÕs power to go directly against the property of a company
owned or controlled by one of the spouses appears less than clear. In both
the Court of Appeal decisions disowning the power (Crittenden v
Crittenden [1990] 2 FLR 361 and Wicks v Wicks [1999] Fam 65) no
reference was seemingly made to Nicholas v Nicholas [1984] FLR 285,
which contained strong Court of Appeal observations that the power
exists when the circumstances there speciÞed pertain. The one reported
case to which I have been referred where the veil was actually lifted
(Green v Green [1993] 1 FLR 326) has been disapproved by one of the
judgments of the Court of Appeal in Wicks v Wicks [1999] Fam 65, but
the disapproval was not the ratio of the decision: neither were Crittenden
v Crittenden [1990] 2 FLR 361 nor Nicholas v Nicholas [1984] FLR 285
seemingly cited to the Court of Appeal in Wicks.

ÔÔFurther, it is quite certain that company law does not recognise any
exception to the separate entity principle based simply on a spouseÕs
having sole ownership and control.

ÔÔRationalisation of approach
ÔÔIdeally the Family Division and the Chancery Division should plainly
apply a common approach. However, the fact remains that di›erent
considerations do frequently pertain: the company approach, on the one
hand, being predominantly concerned with parties at armÕs length in a
contractual or similar relationship; the family approach, on the other
hand, being concerned with the distributive powers of the court as
between husband and wife applying discretionary considerations to what
will often be a mainly, if not entirely, family situation.

ÔÔI would echo the experience referred to by both Cumming-Bruce LJ
and Connell J (above) as regards lifting the veil in the Family Division
when it is just and necessary.
In practice, especially in Ôbig moneyÕ
cases, the husband (as I will assume) will often make a concession that
company/trust assets can be treated as his, whereafter the case proceeds
conveniently on that basis.
It is pragmatic, saves expense and usually
works. Problems such as have arisen in this case are rare and anyway can
be avoided where there are other assets against which the lump sum order
can be enforced.

ÔÔThe di–culty remains in deÞning those situations when lifting the veil
is appropriate by way of enforcement following such a concession in
ancillary relief proceedings. I would suggest that the Family Division can
make orders directly or indirectly regarding a companyÕs assets where
(a) the husband (as I am assuming) is the owner or controller of the
company concerned and (b) where there are no adverse third parties
whose position or interests would be likely to be prejudiced by such an

I include as third parties those with real minority

interests in the company and (where relevant on the facts) creditors and
directors. The reason for my including the latter two categories will
become apparent later in this judgment.

ÔÔI adopt the rationalisation of this o›ered by Mr Hunter, that it would
amount merely to a short-circuiting of the full company law route,
namely the declaration of a dividend to the husband comprising the
company asset concerned (e g the matrimonial home) enabling him
and/or the court then to transfer it onwards to the wife. It would amount
to his property for the purposes of section 24 in the same sense that the
law may look on that as done as ought to be done; whilst the mechanics of
the order would be along the lines adopted by Connell J in Green v Green
[1993] 1 FLR 326, 341: Ôthe respondent do sell, or cause G Ltd to sell,
four plots of the blue land to . . .Õ

ÔÔI would add that lifting the veil is most likely to be acceptable where
the asset concerned (being the property of an e›ectively one-man
company) is the partiesÕ former matrimonial home, or other such asset
owned by the company other than for day-to-day trading purposes.ÕÕ
139 After considering the evidence, Bodey J held that the case was not

one in which he should lift the veil. His reasons were these, at pp 685—686:

ÔÔboth companies are bona Þde trading companies incorporated well
before the matrimonial di–culties of the husband and wife. DIL is
incorporated outside the jurisdiction and the husband is not a director. It
is not suggested that they are as such being used as a sham or device, albeit
that their existence is very convenient to the husband. In my judgment,
there do exist genuine third party rights and interests which ought to be
respected, namely the interests of bona Þde commercial creditors (one of
them secured on the jewellery) and the position of directors who have
Þduciary duties and who oppose the seizure of stock in trade. The facts of
the case are far away from those of Green v Green [1993] 1 FLR 326
which Mr Pointer asks me to follow.

ÔÔApplying the above proposed approach as regards lifting the
corporate veil to the evidence now before me and having heard full legal
argument, I come to the conclusion that this case does not fall within the
necessarily circumscribed circumstances in which lifting the veil would be
acceptable. However much the court may wish to assist a wife and
children where a lump sum has not been paid, I am satisÞed that doing so
here, whensoever it may be permissible, would be a step too far in the all
the circumstances. This is a conclusion strengthened by article 1 of the
First Protocol [to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and
Fundamental Freedoms] that every natural and legal person is to be
entitled, subject to speciÞed exceptions, to the peaceful possession of their
possessions.ÕÕ
140 I do not, with respect, Þnd Bodey JÕs ÔÔrationalisation of approachÕÕ
convincing. Di›erent considerations obviously arise in commercial and
family cases but I cannot see why they can justify a di›erence of approach as
regards lifting the veil.
In all situations, the company is a separate legal
entity. A commercial creditor of the present husband, if unable to obtain
satisfaction from him, might well wish to attach assets of PRL and/or

Vermont as an alternative means of satisfaction. Absent an ability to lift the
corporate veil by Þrst satisfying the VTB conditions, his claim would fail: the
companies assumed and owed him no relevant obligations.
I fail to
understand the principle by which the wifeÕs ancillary relief claim is said to
be enforceable against such companies without any need Þrst to be able to
satisfy the VTB conditions. Why should wives (or husbands) be entitled to a
preferential exemption from what the Salomon case decided?

141 Bodey JÕs further discussion as to when it may be appropriate to lift
the veil in order to satisfy a wifeÕs claim appears to have been premised on
the basis that the husband has conceded that the companyÕs assets can be
regarded as his, which is not this case. Thorpe LJ, in argument, observed
that in his own experience such concessions are rare. I anyway cannot see
that such a concession can take the matter very far. As Bodey J noted, it will
still be necessary for the court to consider whether the veil should be lifted.
His approach was that the lifting (or not) of the veil in family proceedings in
relation to a company wholly or substantially owned by the husband is a
discretionary exercise dependent on a consideration of whether to award the
relevant asset to the wife would prejudice any minority interests in the
company and/or the interests of its directors and creditors. He therefore
favoured a balancing exercise directed to the consideration of whether the
diversion of a company asset to the wife would prejudice interests other than
those of the husband. If it would not, such diversion could be rationalised
(and given legitimacy) on the basis that the husband could be regarded as
under a duty to declare a dividend in his own favour of the asset, which
would then be his property; and ÔÔthe law may look on that as done which
ought to be doneÕÕ.

142 With respect, I neither follow nor agree with Bodey JÕs reasoning.
First, the husband is under no obligation to declare such a dividend even if it
is lawfully open to him to do so. Second, the court has no jurisdiction of
which I am aware to compel him to do so. Third, whether or not he ought to
do so (is that a reference to his moral obligations?), the law does not look on
as done that which ought to be done, even if equity sometimes does,
although it ordinarily does so only in respect of unperformed legal
obligations. Bodey JÕs approach does not appear to me to have much to do
with any true ÔÔlifting of the veilÕÕ. It proceeds instead on the basis that the
relevant assets are the companyÕs, as they are, which has not come by them
in circumstances involving any sort of relevant impropriety, but that the
family courts have a paternalistic jurisdiction to distribute them to a
claimant with no title to them provided that to do so will not prejudicially
a›ect anyone with a real
interest in their being preserved within the
company.

143 That approach is wrong. If, as it is, the question is whether or not
assets held by the company are (i) assets to which the husband is ÔÔentitledÕÕ
within the meaning of section 24(1)(a), or (ii) assets to which he is to be
treated as so entitled, the answer to (i) is that he is not so entitled. As for (ii),
the only circumstance in which it might, as a matter of discretion, be
appropriate to treat him as so entitled is if there are legitimate grounds for
lifting the corporate veil, for which purpose nothing less than compliance
with the VTB conditions will do. Those conditions did not feature in Bodey
JÕs rationalisation, even though he had been referred to this courtÕs decision
in the Adams case as identifying the limitations constraining an ability to lift

the veil. His suggestion that di›erent principles applyÑand, by inference,
should continue to apply in two divisions of the High CourtÑis one with
which I disagree. There is, as Mr Amos put it, but one law and but one High
Court and all its divisions must apply the same law.

144 A v A [2007] 2 FLR 467 is a decision of Munby J. It did not turn on
the piercing of any corporate veil, although in paras 18 and 19 he referred to,
and a–rmed, his own observations in W v H, on which I have earlier
commented, in part negatively. He also made the point, at para 95, that:

ÔÔonly property owned by a party to the marriage can be the subject of a
property adjustment or other order under the Matrimonial Causes Act
1973. Thus, to take a speciÞc example, there is no power in the court . . .
to order the transfer to the wife of the Antigua property, which is owned
by HDC [a company in which the shares were held by the husband, the
wife and a trust].ÕÕ

As to that, I agree.

145 I come back to Ben Hashem v Al Shayif [2009] 1 FLR 115.

Its
importance is that it reßected Munby JÕs exposition, approved by the Court
of Appeal in the VTB case in all respects save one (immaterial for present
purposes), as to the conditions that must be satisÞed before it is open to the
court to pierce the corporate veil and ignore the separate identities of the
company and its corporators. What is essential is the proof of relevant
impropriety. There are, however, perhaps two slightly odd features about
Munby JÕs reasoning.

146 First, he listed several reported authorities as the source of the
conditions that he summarised, and his list (at para 158) includes Nicholas v
Nicholas [1984] FLR 285. Neither the decision nor the dicta in the Nicholas
case, however, support the existence of such conditions. The decision had
nothing to do with veil piercing and the dicta are inconsistent with the
principles that Munby J identiÞed. Moreover, Munby J criticised Connell JÕs
decision to pierce the corporate veil in Green v Green [1993] 1 FLR 326, for
which Connell J had relied simply on the fact of the husbandÕs ownership
and control of the companies, having drawn his inspiration from the dicta in
the Nicholas case. If GreenÕs case was in this respect wrong, it ought to have
followed in Munby JÕs view that the dicta in the Nicholas case were also
wrong. Munby J also pointed out, at para 173, that Bodey J had been
correct in Mubarak v Mubarak [2001] 1 FLR 673 to recognise that the fact
that one spouse has sole ownership and control of a company is not enough
to justify a piercing of the companyÕs corporate veil. All that Munby J
actually said about the Nicholas case, at para 176, was that the veil piercing
claim failed because the minority interests in the company could not be
ignored. But (i) as I have said, I do not consider that there was a ÔÔveil
piercingÕÕ claim in the Nicholas case, and (ii) the suggestion by both Lords
Justices that, but for the minority interests, such a claim could without more
have succeeded cannot stand with Munby JÕs own explanation of the
conditions that must be satisÞed before such a claim can succeed. As for
Cumming-Bruce LJÕs reference to the ÔÔabundant authorityÕÕ in the Family
Division as to the courtÕs willingness and ability to pierce the veil in a ÔÔtotal
controlÕÕ case, Munby J noted at para 221 that counsel had been able to
identify only one Family Division case to date in which the court had
ÔÔpierced the veilÕÕ on that ground, namely Green v Green.

147 The second odd feature is that, in Ben Hashem v Al Shayif [2009]
1 FLR 115, Munby J implicitly endorsed his own earlier agreement with the
Nicholas dicta in W v H, from which he cited without critical comment at
para 94. As his own summary of the basis upon which a companyÕs veil may
be pierced showed that the Nicholas dicta were wrong, so must it have
followed that his earlier endorsement of the dicta was wrong. Munby J was
not entitled to have it both ways.

148 Kremen v Agrest (No 2) [2011] 2 FLR 490 is a decision of Mostyn
J. The case concerned the wifeÕs claim to unscramble successive transfers of
a single share in a BVI company that owned an English property occupied by
the husband. The judge set the transfers aside and declared that the
company held the property beneÞcially for the husband.
In making that
declaration, the judge pierced the companyÕs corporate veil. At para 43, he
said that counsel had asked him to make explicit that, given the terms of
Munby JÕs judgment in Ben HashemÕs case, he had found actual impropriety
on the part of the husband entitling him to pierce the veil. Mostyn J
summarised Ben HashemÕs case and said at para 44 that the decision had
surprised practitioners in ancillary relief proceedings, whose understanding
for years had been conditioned by the dicta in the Nicholas case. Nor did
Mostyn J share Munby JÕs expressed di–culty with Green v Green. He then
referred to Bodey JÕs judgment in MubarakÕs case, saying, at para 46:

ÔÔThere is a strong practical reason why the cloak should be penetrable
In Mubarak v Mubarak [2001]
even absent a Þnding of wrongdoing.
1 FLR 673, Bodey J pointed out that the same end of putting the
underlying asset into the hands of the claimant could be achieved by
going down a pure company law route rather than violating the sanctity
of the corporate veil.ÕÕ

Mostyn J then quoted the same passages from MubarakÕs case that I have.

149 I do not understand what Mostyn J meant by ÔÔgoing down a pure
company law route rather than violating the sanctity of the corporate veilÕÕ.
I am not clear that Bodey J had in mind that the court could order the
husband to declare an appropriate dividend and then release it to the wife. If
so, it would amount to an order requiring the husband to take steps to
achieve the holding by him of an asset he did not currently own and to which
he had no present entitlement. I do not know what jurisdiction there is to
make such an order.
If, as I consider, Bodey JÕs dicta were directed at
making an order directly regarding a companyÕs assets, that does violate the
sanctity to which Mostyn J referred. I add that if, contrary to Mostyn JÕs
view, impropriety needed to be shown before the veil could be pierced,
Mostyn J explained that there was abundant evidence of it in the case before
him. But the thrust of KremenÕs case was, however, that the Nicholas dicta
should be preferred to the Ben Hashem principles.

150 I come Þnally to Hope v Krejci [2012] EWHC 1780 (Fam), another
decision of Mostyn J, to which I have already referred. I shall not discuss the
judgment in at any length. Mostyn J cited from, and discussed, various
authorities to which I have referred,
including his own judgment in
KremenÕs case. At para 27, he endorsed his view as to the supremacy and
binding nature of the dicta in the Nicholas case and said that he did not
regard the VTB case [2012] 2 LloydÕs Rep 313, in which the Nicholas case
was not referred to, as requiring it to be altered. I read Mostyn JÕs discussion

of these matters in Hope v Krejci (although not his decision in KremenÕs
case) as obiter, but there is no doubt as to his view of the law that is or should
be applied in family proceedings.

The respondentÕs notice

151 By a respondentÕs notice, and if wrong on her primary submissions
in support of the judgeÕs reasoning, the wife sought to overturn the judgeÕs
Þndings in para 217 that there was no relevant impropriety in relation to the
establishment of the Petrodel group structure. The wife also challenged the
Þnding in para 218 that the husbandÕs conduct of the litigation did not
amount to relevant impropriety su–cient to justify the court in piercing the
companiesÕ corporate veil.

152 This aspect of the wifeÕs case was barely developed by Mr Todd in
his oral submissions, who acknowledged that, given the judgeÕs Þndings, it
was a di–cult argument.
I consider that it was not only di–cult but
impossible. There is no factual basis upon which this court can conclude
that these long-established companies were incorporated, or were used, as a
cloak or mask to hide the PRL and Vermont properties from the courtÕs gaze;
or, more particularly, as part of an attempt to hoodwink the court into
believing that assets that belonged beneÞcially to the husband were now the
companiesÕ assets and so escaped the wifeÕs reach. The wifeÕs case to such
end was not improved by pointing, as she didÑindeed it formed the main
part of Mr ToddÕs submissionÑto the husbandÕs unco-operative stance in
the litigation. In my judgment, there is no substance to this part of the wifeÕs
case and I shall devote no more space to it.

153 The wife also contended that the judge was wrong not to Þnd that
the relevant PRL and Vermont properties were held by those companies as
nominees or trustees for the husband. To that end, Mr Todd referred us to
several paragraphs of the judgeÕs judgment that he said supported such a
Þnding. These were, in the main, paragraphs in which the judge discussed
whether the assets of the Petrodel companies belonged to the husband rather
than the companies and concluded that they did.
I have explained why
I consider that the judge was wrong in that conclusion. If my criticism of his
judgment in that respect is justiÞed, there is, I consider, nothing in his
judgment that could enable this court to Þnd that he ought none the less to
have found that the speciÞc properties held by PRL and Vermont that are the
subject of para 5 of his order belonged beneÞcially to the husband. I would
also reject this argument advanced by the wife.

Conclusion

154 I have made clear my views on the ÔÔveil piercingÕÕ issue, but shall
summarise them. Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd [1897] AC 22 is House of
Lords authority a–rming the distinction between the separate legal
personalities of a company and its corporators.
It makes no di›erence to
such distinction that the company has a single corporator with total control
over its a›airs. It is a feature of the principle that a companyÕs assets belong
beneÞcially to the company and that its corporators have no interest in, or
entitlement to, them. It is a further feature of it that such assets cannot be
looked to in order to satisfy the personal obligations of the corporators, any
more than the lattersÕ personal assets can be looked to in order to satisfy the

In special circumstances, in particular in the
obligations of the company.
winding up of an insolvent company, there may be a statutory basis for
requiring the corporators to contribute personally to the companyÕs assets,
for example if they have misapplied its assets or engaged in wrongful or
fraudulent trading: see sections 212 to 214 of the Insolvency Act 1986.
Exceptions of that nature are, however, irrelevant for present purposes.

155 Subject to exceptions such as those, and to cases in which it is
legitimate to pierce the corporate veil, the separate corporate identity of a
company is a fact of legal life that all courts are required to recognise and
respect, whatever jurisdiction they are exercising. It is not open to a court,
simply because it regards it as just and convenient, to disregard such separate
identity and to appropriate the assets of a company in satisfaction either of
the monetary claims of its corporatorÕs creditors or of the monetary ancillary
relief claims of its corporatorÕs spouse. SalomonÕs case precludes any such
approach; and the same was made clear by the House of Lords in Woolfson v
Strathclyde Regional Council 1978 SC (HL) 90 and by the Court of Appeal
in Adams v Cape Industries plc [1990] Ch 433, Ord v Belhaven Pubs Ltd
[1998] 2 BCLC 447 and VTB Capital plc v Nutritek International Corpn
[2012] 2 LloydÕs Rep 313. The obiter dicta in Nicholas v Nicholas [1984]
FLR 285 to di›erent e›ect are inconsistent with the Salomon, Woolfson,
Adams, Ord and VTB cases and advance no reasoning why a di›erent
principle should apply in the family jurisdiction as compared with other
jurisdictions. The Salomon principle must apply equally to all jurisdictions.
A one-man company does not metamorphose into the one-man simply
because the person with a wish to abstract its assets is his wife.

156 The Woolfson, Adams, Ord, Ben Hashem and VTB cases show that
there may be factual circumstances in which it will be legitimate for the
court to pierce a companyÕs corporate veil and, to an appropriate extent,
disregard the fact of its separate identity from that of its corporators. They
all, however, a–rm that that can only be done in limited circumstances,
central to which is the demonstration of relevant impropriety in the
corporatorsÕ use of the company. The rationale for such an exceptional
jurisdiction is that the controllers of the company have so used the fact of its
separate identity for improper purposes that it may be appropriate for the
court to disregard its separate identity in order that its controllers may not
derive the advantage from such abuse that they intended to achieve.
It is
perhaps a relative of the principle that a wrongdoer cannot ordinarily be
allowed to proÞt from his own wrong. The jurisdiction, whilst of interest to
legal theorists, is an exceptional one and there are few reported decisions
where it has been applied (including, in particular, in family proceedings).
Just as there is no rational ground for regarding the family courts as exempt
from the Salomon case, so is there is no rational ground for regarding them
as exempt from the need to be satisÞed as to the conditions a–rmed in the
VTB case before piercing of a corporate veil. The dicta in the Nicholas case
cannot stand with the principles explained in the Woolfson, Adams, Ord,
Ben Hashem and VTB cases and they should no longer be regarded as of any

principles as inapplicable in family cases and instead supported the Nicholas
dicta, I would respectfully disagree with him.

157 In this case, once the judge had rejected the impropriety assertion,
he had no choice but to reject the claim that PRL and VermontÕs London
properties were or could be regarded as properties to which the husband had
any entitlement. He had no jurisdiction under section 24(1)(a) to make the
orders he did in relation to them.
In so far as he was suggesting that
section 24(1)(a) enabled the court to treat a companyÕs property as
belonging to its 100% owner, he was wrong. Section 24(1)(a) confers no
such jurisdiction.
It does no more than confer a jurisdiction to make a
transfer order in respect of property to which the respondent spouse is
beneÞcially entitled. Whether such spouse is or is not so entitled to the
particular item of property in issue will be a question of fact, to be answered
in the same way as it would regardless of the making of any application
under section 24(1)(a).

158 I would allow the appeals by PRL and Vermont against the judgeÕs

para 5 orders.

PATTEN LJ

159 I agree that the appeal should be allowed for the reasons contained
in the judgment of Rimer LJ and I fully endorse his treatment of the issues of
beneÞcial ownership and the limited circumstances in which it may be
appropriate to pierce the veil of incorporation.

that

160 What needs

to be emphasised is

the provisions of
section 24(1)(a) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 do not give the court
power to disapply the established principles of
legal and beneÞcial
ownership or of company law. On the contrary, those principles were
plainly intended to deÞne the limits of the courtÕs jurisdiction under the
statute and Moylan J was wrong to give the words ÔÔentitled, either in
possession or reversionÕÕ any wider meaning. Married couples who choose
to vest assets beneÞcially in a company for what the judge described as
conventional reasons including wealth protection and the avoidance of tax
cannot ignore the legal consequences of their actions in less happy times.

161 I wish particularly to support Rimer LJÕs criticism of the dicta in
Nicholas v Nicholas [1984] FLR 285 and his view that these cannot be relied
upon as a correct statement of the law following the decision of this court in
Adams v Cape Industries plc [1990] Ch 433. They have led judges of the
Family Division to adopt and develop an approach to company owned assets
in ancillary relief applications which amounts almost to a separate system of
legal rules una›ected by the relevant principles of English property and
company law. That must now cease.

The wife appealed. The issues for the Supreme Court, as set out in the

power in the context of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 to order the
transfer of assets, as part of an ancillary relief award, which belonged to

third party companies; (2) on a proper analysis, the companies held the
properties on trust for the husband and as such the court was empowered to
transfer those properties to the wife; (3) section 24(1)(c)(d) of the Act
empowered the court to alter the settlement by which the husband was
entitled to a beneÞcial interest in both the shares in the companies and their
assets; and (4) the circumstances were such that the wife should be permitted
to pierce the veil of incorporation either on the ground of impropriety or in
the interests of justice.

The facts are stated in the judgment of Lord Sumption JSC.

Richard Todd QC, Daniel Lightman and Stephen Trowell (instructed by

Farrer & Co LLP) for the wife.

Where an asset is held by a company which is e›ectively the alter ego of a
spouse, and the legitimate priority interests of innocent third parties can be
protected, section 24(1)(a) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 operates as
a statutory exception to the rule against piercing the corporate veil, enabling
the court to look at the reality of the underlying ownership of the asset and
to deal with the asset accordingly: see Nicholas v Nicholas [1984] FLR 285;
Green v Green [1993] 1 FLR 326; W v H (Family Division: Without Notice
Orders) [2001] 1 All ER 300; A v A [2007] 2 FLR 467; Ben Hashem v Al
Shayif [2009] 1 FLR 115; Mubarak v Mubarak [2001] 1 FLR 673 and
Kremen v Agrest (No 2) [2011] 2 FLR 490.

A person is entitled to the possession of an asset if he has the right and
ability to procure its transfer to him for his own use, free of legitimate third
party objection. The husband has all the rights of a 100% shareholder and
controller in the respondent companies, including the right to a memberÕs
voluntary liquidation.
Since the husband and the companies failed to
disclose the net asset position of the companies and failed to provide the
disclosure as to the acquisition costs of the properties which the husband and
the companies had been ordered to produce, the judge was entitled to
proceed on the basis that the secured creditors would be una›ected by the
proceedings; further or alternatively that the wifeÕs cross-appeal should
succeed on its facts and that it be declared that the companies held the
properties on resulting trust for the husband: for authority on the burden of
proof and who should call which evidence, see Herrington v British
Railways Board [1972] AC 877 and Wisniewski v Central Manchester
Health Authority [1998] PIQR P324.

The husband could be ordered to put the companies into a members
voluntary liquidation and the net proceeds then distributed to the wife;
rather than employ this largely artiÞcial exercise, the process could be
ÔÔtelescopedÕÕ into a transfer of the underlying assets (subject to the interests
of secured and trade creditors) to the wife.

The purpose of the Act is to do fairness as between spouses. The court
had a wide discretion to achieve this including by variation of a settlement:
see Brooks v Brooks [1996] AC 375. The Act requires the court to look not
only at what a spouse has now but at resources to which a spouse is or might
become entitled in the future: see sections 24(1) and 25 and Crews-Orchard
v Crews-Orchard (1970) 114 SJ 150.

The court may take notice of the fact that a spouse not only controls a
company but, subject to third party interests, may dispose of it at will: see W
v H (Family Division: Without Notice Orders) [2001] 1 All ER 300, 311;

1 FLR 326 and Mubarak v Mubarak [2001] 1 FLR 673, 679, 682. In the
minority of cases where a spouseÕs legitimate claim can only be met by
company assets the court should look to the powers vested in it by
section 24(1) and have regard to the powers and control of the other spouse.
If the interpretation of section 24(1)(a) favoured by the majority of the Court
of Appeal is upheld, the corporate structure will (subject to the applicability
of section 24(1)(c)) become a mechanism through which the aim of
achieving fairness will be defeated. Whilst the court can order the shares to
be transferred that would be frustrated in this case where the shares are held
in a ÔÔLa RondeÕÕ arrangement whereby company A owns B, which owns
C which in turn owns A and the companies are in three di›erent
jurisdictions. The jurisdiction to transfer assets held by a company under
section 24(1) would only ever be exercised sparingly, and only in an ÔÔalter
egoÕÕ case where the company and the spouse can be treated as one and the
same person for the purposes of section 24(1): see Ben Hashem v Al Shayif
[2009] 1 FLR 115 and VTB Capital plc v Nutritek International Corpn
[2012] 2 LloydÕs Rep 313. The 1973 Act is not alone in representing a
statutory departure from the sanctity of the corporate veil: see Adams v
Cape Industries plc [1990] Ch 433; Nokes v Doncaster Amalgamated
Collieries Ltd [1940] AC 1014; In re H (Restraint Order: Realisable
Property) [1996] 2 All ER 391 and Director of Public Prosecutions v
Compton The Times, 11 December 2002.

In circumstances where (1) the companies had failed to serve points of
defence, (2) the husband had failed to provide the information sought and
had given contradictory accounts of beneÞcial ownership, (3) a positive case
had been advanced by the wife in her statement that the understanding was
that the properties were beneÞcially owned by the husband and (4) the judge
had recorded that some of the properties had been transferred for a nominal
amount, the judge was entitled to Þnd that the properties were held by the
companies on trust for the husband.

Furthermore, the companies and/or the relevant underlying properties
could be regarded as constituting ÔÔnuptial settlementsÕÕ capable of variation
under section 24(1)(c). A liberal and purposive approach must be taken to
the interpretation of ÔÔnuptial settlementÕÕ in the context of the Act: see Blood
v Blood [1902] P 78, 82; Bosworthick v Bosworthick [1927] P 64, 71, 72;
Prinsep v Prinsep [1929] P 225, 232, 235; Brooks v Brooks [1996] AC 375,
391—392; Ben Hashem v Al Shayif [2009] 1 FLR 115, para 234; E v

(Financial Order: Overseas Trust) [2012] 1 FLR 667 and Hope v Krejci
[2013] 1 FLR 182. The jurisdiction under section 24(1)(c) is not limited to
cases concerning the matrimonial home, nor is there any reason why the
powers in section 24(1)(c) should be limited to trust structures. The
legislation should be read so as to enable the court to do justice between the
parties. The Þndings of fact made by the judge are consistent with a
determination that there is a nuptial settlement.

either on the ground of impropriety or in the interests of justice, in order to
obtain a fair outcome and the transfer of the properties which are in the
names of the companies. The judge erred in holding that the companies
cannot be held to have been improperly used, having been originally
constituted properly, and Rimer LJ, ante, pp 441—442, paras 89, 90, was
wrong in holding that because the judge had found that the companies were
originally properly constituted it would be inconsistent to hold that the
companies were shams or nominees. The husband was using the corporate
structure to defeat both the courtÕs inquiry and the subsequent enforcement
of an order. There was relevant impropriety: see Ben Hashem v Al Shayif
[2009] 1 FLR 115, para 164. Historically, the courts have recognised the
in the interests of justice: see In re
need to pierce the corporate veil
A Company [1985] BCLC 333. The suggestion in Adams v Cape Industries
plc [1990] Ch 433 that the interests of justice is not a su–cient ground on
which to pierce the corporate veil was made without the courtÕs attention
being drawn to In re A Company and should not be followed: see Trustor AB
v Smallbone (No 2) [2001] 1 WLR 1177, para 21.
In the exceptional
circumstances in which property has been held by a corporate structure that
is wholly controlled by one party to the marriage, making that partyÕs
shareholding the subject of an order under section 24(1) of the Act both
impractical and unlikely to be enforceable in practice, and that property has
overwhelmingly been used for the beneÞt of the parties to the marriage, the
court should have the discretion to pierce the corporate veil to make that
property the subject of an order under section 24(1) of the Act in the
interests of justice. Such a narrow and precisely restricted exception would
enable the court to respond to the demands of justice without unduly
compromising certainty. The husbandÕs conduct in the present proceedings
removes any doubt that the interests of justice are overwhelmingly in favour
of the wife.

Je›rey Green Russell Ltd) for the Petrodel companies.

ÔÔEntitledÕÕ in section 24(1)(a) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 must
be given its ordinary narrow meaning. It entails an enforceable right. Thus
the court can only order the transfer of assets in which a party holds a legal
or beneÞcial interest. The companiesÕ assets are not the husbandÕs assets: see
Broderip v Salomon [1895] 2 Ch 323; sub nom Salomon v A Salomon & Co
Ltd [1897] AC 22. A controlling shareholder, even if he is the sole
shareholder, has no interest in, or entitlement to, the companyÕs own
property: see Macaura v Northern Assurance Co Ltd [1925] AC 619,
626—627. These principles form an integral part of English law and apply
equally to ancillary relief proceedings since the law has to be applied in an
homogeneous, structured and disciplined manner across all Divisions of the
High Court: see McFarlane v McFarlane [2006] 2 AC 618; Imerman v
Tchenguiz [2011] Fam 116; Jones v Jones [2012] Fam 1 and A v A [2007]
2 FLR 467.

Section 24(1)(a) does not operate as a statutory exception to these
principles. There is no suggestion within its language, or its legislative
history, to indicate that Parliament intended, by implication, to create a far-
reaching exception which would allow a court in ancillary relief proceedings

to ignore the separate legal personality of a company and treat its property
as the personal property of its controlling shareholder. [Reference was made
to section 45 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1857 (20 & 21 Vict c 85) and
Milne v Milne (1871) LR 2 P & D 295, 299.] On the contrary,
section 24(1)(a) on its face and as a matter of statutory construction is
limited to property to which a party to a marriage has an enforceable right of
ownership in possession or reversion. An ability in practical terms to extract
an asset from a company does not equate to a rightful claim. Unvested
prospective rights are also insu–cient: see Crews-Orchard v Crews-Orchard
(1970) 114 SJ 150. There is nothing within section 24(1)(a) to suggest that
the court may simply disregard the English insolvency and capital-
maintenance regimes and contractual rights of other shareholders and,
instead, decide as a matter of judicial discretion which third party creditors
and shareholders are su–ciently deserving of protection. Such an approach
would create intolerable uncertainty for persons proposing to advance
moneys to a company controlled by a party to a marriage. Clear and express
wording would be required to achieve such a result: see Bank voor Handel
en Scheepvaart NV v Slatford [1953] 1 QB 248, 278. That case also
emphasises (at p 265) the international nature and acceptance of the concept
of separate corporate personality, which in the present case has the added
importance of the consideration of increasing respect and recognition by
foreign courts for the decisions and workings of English courts and English
family law.

if

Further,

The decision of the majority of the Court of Appeal does not enable an
unscrupulous party to a marriage to evade an ancillary relief award. First, if
that party holds shares in a company, such shares themselves are property to
which he is entitled and a court granting ancillary relief may order that they
be transferred to the other party to the marriage.
the
unscrupulous party takes steps to place his assets in a corporate vehicle in
order to avoid liability to pay ancillary relief, there are a variety of anti-
avoidance measures which may be available to reverse such transfers: see
section 37 of the 1973 Act and section 423 of the Insolvency Act 1986.
Alternatively, if a party to a marriage takes steps to place assets in a company
in order to evade an award of ancillary relief, the matrimonial court may be
justiÞed in piercing the corporate veil through the application of common
law principles by virtue of the impropriety exception. The wifeÕs reliance on
statutes disregarding the separate legal personality of a company is
misplaced: see In re H (Restraint Order: Realisable Property) [1996] 2 All
ER 391, 400—401; Director of Public Prosecutions v Compton [2002]
EWCA Civ 1720 at [44]; R v K [2006] BCC 362, para 25 and R v Gomez
[1993] AC 442, 496—497. The unfortunate position of the wife is no reason
for making an unprincipled order: see Ben Hashem v Al Shayif [2009] 1 FLR
115, para 301.
If reform is needed it is a matter for Parliament, not the
courts: see R (Prudential plc) v Special Comr of Income Tax (Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales intervening) [2013] 2 AC 185,
para 49. [Reference was also made to Charman v Charman (No 4) [2007]

In VTB Capital plc v Nutritek International Corpn [2013] 2 AC 337 the
Supreme Court assumed, without deciding, that English law permits the veil
of incorporation to be pierced on appropriate facts.
If it is necessary to
decide whether there are, as a matter of principle, any grounds on which the
corporate veil can be pierced at common law, it would be open to the court to
conclude that there are no freestanding common law principles. Given that
statute has given a company a separate legal existence, only statute can take
that existence away. Moreover, the cases which are relied on by the wife to
establish the courtsÕ power to pierce the veil can be explained on other
grounds or, in so far as they do suggest that such a jurisdiction exists, they
should be rejected as inconsistent with the clear statements of principle
contained in Broderip v Salomon [1895] 2 Ch 323; sub nom Salomon v
A Salomon & Co Ltd [1897] AC 22; Woolfson v Strathclyde Regional
Council 1978 SC (HL) 90; Adams v Cape Industries plc [1990] Ch 433;

Shayif [2009] 1 FLR 115 and VTB Capital plc v Nutritek International

285, 287E-F, 292F, of Cumming-Bruce LJ in In re A Company [1985] BCLC
333, 337I—338B and of Munby J in W v H (Family Division: Without Notice
Orders) [2001] 1 All ER 300, 310H. Alternatively, if there are freestanding
common law principles enabling the courts to pierce the corporate veil, the
courts may in any event only do so if there is proof of relevant impropriety
involving the misuse of a corporate structure to conceal or avoid a legal
liability: see Ben Hashem v Al Shayif [2009] 1 FLR 115, paras 159—164;
VTB Capital plc v Nutritek International Corpn [2012] 2 LloydÕs Rep 313;
[2013] 2 AC 337, para 79. The courts cannot simply pierce the corporate veil
whenever they perceive it to be in the interests of justice. The husband was
not guilty of relevant impropriety which would justify piercing the corporate
veil. Rather the corporate structure was set up and has been used for
conventional reasons, including wealth protection and the avoidance of tax.
The fact that the husband may have adopted an unco-operative stance in
litigation against the wife does not turn this entirely legitimate use of a
corporate structure into an improper use of such structure.

The judge did not Þnd that the companies held all of their properties on
trust for the husband. On the contrary, he concluded that the properties were
ÔÔe›ectivelyÕÕ the property of the husband and that the companies were ÔÔin
e›ectÕÕ nominees of the husband. These conclusions would have made no
sense if the companies were in fact nominees for the husband. Accordingly,
as the Court of Appeal correctly concluded, the judgeÕs rejection of this aspect
of the wifeÕs case was clear. There is no new evidence or other material which
would provide a basis for the Supreme Court to disturb the clear rejection of
this aspect of the wifeÕs case. Further, and in any event, the companies were
not and are not nuptial settlementsÑneither settlements, nor nuptial.

to escape his responsibilities to his wife and children by deploying either
(a) a corporate veil or (b) a cloak over the true beneÞcial ownership of the
properties. Here the husbandÕs and the companiesÕ failures to provide
proper disclosure raised the inference that the companies were beneÞcially
owned by the husband. If so that beneÞcial interest could be transferred to
the wife. Once the wife had asserted a positive case of beneÞcial ownership
it fell to the husband to produce the evidence which should have been in his
gift and which he and the companies were ordered to provide; their failure to
do so should result in a Þnding that the companies hold the bare legal title on
trusts of land for the husband as beneÞcial owner.

The word ÔÔentitledÕÕ in the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 is a word in
common use; it gives for an easy interpretation. If a reasonable person were
asked ÔÔis Mr Prest entitled to these properties in circumstances where he
could lawfully require their transfer or sale without any legitimate third
party objectionÕÕ then they would answer ÔÔyesÕÕ. Any arcane interpretation
which fails to achieve the underlying purpose of the Act is to be strongly
discouraged. Whilst of very limited use, the doctrine of piercing the corporate
veil survives and this would be an appropriate case for its deployment.

The court took time for consideration.

12 June 2013. The following judgments were handed down.

LORD SUMPTION JSC

Introduction

1 This appeal arises out of proceedings for ancillary relief following a
divorce. The principal parties before the judge, Moylan J, were Michael and
Yasmin Prest. He was born in Nigeria and she in England. Both have dual
Nigerian and British nationality. They were married in 1993, and during the
marriage the matrimonial home was in England, although the husband was
found by the judge to have been resident in Monaco from about 2001 to
date. There was also a second home in Nevis. The wife petitioned for
divorce in March 2008. A decree nisi was pronounced in December 2008,
and a decree absolute in November 2011.

2 The husband is not party to the appeal in point of form, although he is
present in spirit. The appeal concerns only the position of a number of
companies belonging to the group known as the Petrodel Group which the
judge found to be wholly owned and controlled (directly or through
intermediate entities) by the husband.
There were originally seven
companies involved, all of which were joined as additional respondents to
the wifeÕs application for ancillary relief. They were Petrodel Resources Ltd
(ÔÔPRLÕÕ), Petrodel Resources (Nigeria) Ltd (ÔÔPRL NigeriaÕÕ), Petrodel
Upstream Ltd (ÔÔUpstreamÕÕ), Vermont Petroleum Ltd (ÔÔVermontÕÕ), Elysium
Diem Ltd, Petrodel Resources (Nevis) Ltd (ÔÔPRL NevisÕÕ) and Elysium Diem
Ltd (Nevis). Three of these companies, PRL, Upstream and Vermont, all
incorporated in the Isle of Man, are the respondents in this court. PRL was
the legal owner of the matrimonial home, which was bought in the name of
the company in 2001 but was found by the judge to be held for the husband
beneÞcially. There is no longer any issue about that property, which is
apparently in the process of being transferred to the wife. In addition, PRL

was the legal owner of Þve residential properties in the United Kingdom and
Vermont is the legal owner of two more. The question on this appeal is
whether the court has power to order the transfer of these seven properties to
the wife given that they legally belong not to him but to his companies.

3 Part II of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 confers wide powers on
the court to order ancillary relief in matrimonial proceedings. Section 23
provides for periodical and lump sum payments to a spouse or for the beneÞt
of children of the marriage. Under section 24(1)(a), the court may order that
ÔÔa party to the marriage shall transfer to the other party . . . such property as
may be so speciÞed, being property to which the Þrst-mentioned party is
entitled, either in possession or reversionÕÕ. Section 25, as substituted by
sections 3 and 48(2) of the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984,
provides for a number of matters to which the court must in particular have
regard in making such orders, including, at section 25(2)(a), the ÔÔincome,
earning capacity, property and other Þnancial resources which each of the
parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable futureÕÕ.

4 The proper exercise of these powers calls for a considerable measure
of candour by the parties in disclosing their Þnancial a›airs, and extensive
procedural powers are available to the court to compel disclosure if
necessary. In this case, the husbandÕs conduct of the proceedings has been
characterised by persistent obstruction, obfuscation and deceit, and a
contumelious refusal to comply with rules of court and speciÞc orders. The
judge, Moylan J, recited in his judgment [2011] EWHC 2956 (Fam) the long
history of successive orders of the court which were either ignored or
evaded, the various attempts of the husband to conceal the extent of his
assets in the course of his evidence, and the collusive proceedings in Nigeria
by which he sought declarations that certain of the companies were held in
trust for his siblings. The only evidence on behalf of the respondent
companies was an a–davit sworn by Mr Jack Murphy, a director of PRL
and the corporate secretary of the three respondent companies, who failed to
attend for cross-examination on it. The judge rejected his excuse that he was
in bad health, and found that he was ÔÔunwilling rather than unable to attend
courtÕÕ: para 69. His conclusion was that

ÔÔas a result of the husbandÕs abject failure to comply with his
disclosure obligations and to comply with orders made by the court
during the course of these proceedings, I do not have the evidence which
would enable me to assemble a conventional schedule of assetsÕÕ: para 13.
However, he found that the husband was the sole beneÞcial owner and the
controller of the companies, and doing the best that he could on the material
available assessed his net assets at £37.5m.

5 By his order dated 16 November 2011, Moylan J ordered that the
husband should procure the conveyance of the matrimonial home at
16, Warwick Avenue, London W2 to the wife, free of incumbrances, and
that he should make a lump sum payment to her of £17.5m and periodical
payments at the rate of 2% of that sum while it remained outstanding,
together with £24,000 per annum and the school fees for each of their four
children. In addition he awarded costs in favour of the wife, with a payment
of £600,000 on account. The judge ordered the husband to procure the
transfer of the seven UK properties legally owned by PRL and Vermont to
the wife in partial satisfaction of the lump sum order. He directed those

companies to execute such documents as might be necessary to give e›ect to
the transfer of the matrimonial home and the seven properties. Moreover, in
awarding costs to the wife, the judge directed that PRL, Upstream and
Vermont should be jointly and severally liable with the husband for 10% of
those costs. Corresponding orders were made against certain of the other
corporate respondents to the original proceedings, but they did not appeal,
either to the Court of Appeal or to this court, and are no longer relevant,
save in so far as the facts relating to them throw light on the position of the
three respondents. No order was made (or sought) for the transfer of any
assets of Upstream, but that company is interested in the present appeal by
virtue of its liability under the judgeÕs order for part of the wifeÕs costs.

6 The distinctive feature of the judgeÕs approach was that he concluded
that there was no general principle of law which entitled him to reach the
companiesÕ assets by piercing the corporate veil. This was because the
authorities showed that the separate legal personality of the company could
not be disregarded unless it was being abused for a purpose that was in some
relevant respect improper. He held that there was no relevant impropriety.
He nevertheless concluded that in applications for Þnancial relief ancillary to
a divorce, a wider jurisdiction to pierce the corporate veil was available
under section 24 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. The judge found that
the matrimonial home was held by PRL on trust for the husband, but he
made no corresponding Þnding about the seven other properties and refused
to make a declaration that the husband was their beneÞcial owner.
It is
tolerably clear from his supplementary judgment of 16 November 2011
[2011] EWHC 3066 (Fam) (on the form of the order), that this was because
having decided that he was speciÞcally authorised to dispose of the
companiesÕ properties under section 24, it was unnecessary for him to do so
and undesirable because of ÔÔthe potential tax consequencesÕÕ: para 14. It is
not clear what potential tax consequences he had in mind, but his
observation suggests that without them he might well have made the
declaration sought.

7 In the Court of Appeal, the three respondent companies challenged
the orders made against them on the ground that there was no jurisdiction to
order their property to be conveyed to the wife in satisfaction of the
husbandÕs judgment debt. This contention, which has been repeated before
us, raises a question of some importance. For some years it has been the
practice of the Family Division to treat the assets of companies substantially
owned by one party to the marriage as available for distribution under
section 24 of the Matrimonial Causes Act, provided that the remaining
assets of the company are su–cient to satisfy its creditors. In the Court of
Appeal, the practice was supported by Thorpe LJ, but the majority
disagreed: ante, pp 421—467. Rimer LJ, delivering the leading judgment for
the majority, held that the practice developed by the Family Division was
beyond the jurisdiction of the court unless (i) the corporate personality of the
company was being abused for a purpose which was in some relevant respect
improper, or (ii) on the particular facts of the case it could be shown that an
asset legally owned by the company was held in trust for the husband. He
considered that the judge had rejected both of these possibilities on the facts,
and that he ought not therefore to have made the order.
In a short
concurring judgment, Patten LJ, ante, p 467, para 161, said that the Family
Division had developed ÔÔan approach to company owned assets in ancillary

relief applications which amounts almost to a separate system of legal rules
una›ected by the relevant principles of English property and company law.ÕÕ
The practice, he concluded, ÔÔmust now ceaseÕÕ. This has signiÞcant practical
implications. Unless the UK properties of the Petrodel Group are transferred
to Mrs Prest, it is possible (she says likely) that the lump sum order in her
favour will remain wholly unsatisÞed. To date, the matrimonial home has
been transferred to her but only subject to a pre-existing charge in favour of
BNP Paribas to secure a debt of undisclosed amount. 10% of the money
ordered to be paid on account of costs has been paid by the three
respondents, but only in order to satisfy a condition imposed on them on
their being granted leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal. Otherwise, apart
from paying the childrenÕs school fees, the husband has not complied with
any part of Moylan JÕs order and shows no intention of doing so if he can
possibly avoid it.

property is its own, and not that of its shareholders.
A Salomon & Co Ltd [1897] AC 22, the House of Lords held that these
principles applied as much to a company that was wholly owned and
In Macaura v Northern
controlled by one man as to any other company.
Assurance Co Ltd [1925] AC 619, the House of Lords held that the sole
owner and controller of a company did not even have an insurable interest in
property of the company, although economically he was liable to su›er by its
destruction. Lord Buckmaster said, at pp 626—627:

ÔÔno shareholder has any right to any item of property owned by the
company, for he has no legal or equitable interest therein. He is entitled
to a share in the proÞts while the company continues to carry on business
and a share in the distribution of the surplus assets when the company is
wound up.ÕÕ

In Lonrho Ltd v Shell Petroleum Co Ltd [1980] 1 WLR 627 the House of
Lords held that documents of a subsidiary were not in the ÔÔpowerÕÕ of its
parent company for the purposes of disclosure in litigation, simply by virtue
of the latterÕs ownership and control of the group. These principles are the
starting point for the elaborate restrictions imposed by English law on a
wide range of transactions which have the direct or indirect e›ect of
distributing capital to shareholders. The separate personality and property
of a company is sometimes described as a Þction, and in a sense it is. But the
Þction is the whole foundation of English company and insolvency law. As
Robert Go› LJ once observed, in this domain ÔÔwe are concerned not with
economics but with law. The distinction between the two is, in law,
fundamentalÕÕ: Bank of Tokyo Ltd v Karoon (Note) [1987] AC 45, 64. He
could justly have added that it is not just legally but economically
fundamental, since limited companies have been the principal unit of
commercial life for more than a century. Their separate personality and
property are the basis on which third parties are entitled to deal with them
and commonly do deal with them.

9 Against this background, there are three possible legal bases on which
the assets of the Petrodel companies might be available to satisfy the lump
sum order against the husband: (1) It might be said that this is a case in
which, exceptionally, a court is at liberty to disregard the corporate veil in
order to give e›ective relief. (2) Section 24 of the Matrimonial Causes Act
might be regarded as conferring a distinct power to disregard the corporate
veil in matrimonial cases. (3) The companies might be regarded as holding
the properties on trust for the husband, not by virtue of his status as their
sole shareholder and controller, but in the particular circumstances of this
case.

The judgeÕs Þndings: the companies

10 Most of the judgeÕs Þndings of fact were directed to two questions
which are no longer in dispute, namely whether the husband owned the
Petrodel Group and what was the value of his assets. For present purposes, it
is enough to summarise those which bear on the position of the three
corporate respondents.

11 At the time of the marriage, and throughout the 1990s, the husband
was employed by a succession of major international oil trading companies
as a trader, but in 2001 he left his last employer, Marc Rich, and began to
run his own companies.
Initially, there were two principal companies
involved, Aurora and the Petrodel companies. In 2004 Aurora was wound
up and thereafter he operated mainly through the Petrodel companies. The
principal operating company of
this group was PRL, a company
incorporated in the Isle of Man. Its Þnancial statements record that it was
incorporated on 4 May 1993, was dormant until 1996, and did not begin
operations until 25 April 2002, i e after the husband had left Marc Rich and
set up on his own. Between 1996 and 2002, it is described in its Þnancial
statements as a property investment company.
Its sole function in that
period appears to have been to hold title to the matrimonial home at
16, Warwick Avenue in London and Þve residential investment properties in
London, and to act as a channel for funding property purchases by other
companies of the group. The husbandÕs evidence was that the company had
engaged in substantial agricultural and oil related business in the 1990s, in
part in association with his then employer, Marc Rich. But this was
inconsistent with the companyÕs Þnancial statements, and the judge rejected
it. Mr Le Breton, a former business colleague of the husband, gave evidence
at the hearing which the judge accepted as reliable. Mr Le Breton said that
from about 2001 PRL was engaged in a limited way in oil trading and
shipping, and from 2006 moved into oil exploration and production in
Nigeria and West Africa. The latest disclosed accounts of PRL are draft
accounts for 2008 and 2009. The judge (para 147) declined to attach ÔÔany
signiÞcant weightÕÕ to the Þnancial data in the 2008 accounts, which he
considered to have been manipulated. All the disclosed accounts are now
very much out of date. For what they are worth, the accounts for both years
show a substantial turnover and large balances. The husbandÕs evidence was
that PRL ceased trading in 2010, when it lost its major exploration contract.
Given his evident determination to frustrate his wifeÕs claims on him, it
cannot be assumed that the assets of the company recorded in the disclosed
accounts are still there.

12 Management control of PRL has always been in the hands of the
husband, ostensibly as chief executive under a contract of employment
conferring on him complete discretion in the management of its business.
The judge found that none of the companies had ever had any independent
directors. The husband is a director of PRL Nigeria, but otherwise the
directors are all nominal or professional directors, generally his relatives,
who accept directions from him. The directors of PRL are Mr Murphy (the
principal of its corporate secretary) and a lady in Nevis who appears to have
been the coupleÕs cleaner there.

13 The ownership of the respondent companies proved to be more
di–cult to establish. The husband did not admit to having any personal
interest in the shares of any company of the group, and declined to say who
the ultimate shareholders were. Substantially all of the issued shares of PRL
are owned by PRL Nigeria. Almost all the shares of that company are
owned by PRL Nevis, a company about which very little is known, but
whose accounts show substantial balances, apparently derived from trading.
The husbandÕs evidence was that the shares of PRL Nevis were owned by its
own subsidiary PRL Nigeria. The judge described this as ÔÔpuzzlingÕÕ
(para 55) but made no Þnding as to whether it was true. More recently, it
has been suggested that PRL Nevis is owned by a family trust about which,
however, nothing has been disclosed. In the end, it did not matter, because
the judge cut through the complexities of the corporate structure by
accepting the evidence of the wife and Mr Le Breton that the husband was
the true owner of the Petrodel Group, as he had always told them he was,
even if the exact means by which he held it remained obscure. That
accounted for PRL, PRL Nigeria and PRL Nevis.

14 It also accounted for Vermont, whose shares are held 49% by PRL
and 51% by PRL Nigeria, and Upstream, which had a single issued share
held by PRL Nevis. Vermont was and possibly still is a trading company.
The husbandÕs evidence was that it began to ship crude oil in 2010. The
exact nature of UpstreamÕs business (if any) is unclear. It does not appear to
trade.

15 The husband declined to answer the question whether he received
any beneÞts from PRL other than his salary, saying that this was an
ÔÔaccounting questionÕÕ. The judge, however, made extensive Þndings about
this. He found that his personal expenditure substantially exceeded his
salary and bonuses as chief executive, and that the di›erence was funded
entirely by the company. There was no formality involved. The husband
simply treated the companiesÕ cash balances and property as his own and
drew on them as he saw Þt. The judge found that the husband had
ÔÔunrestricted accessÕÕ to the companiesÕ assets, unconÞned by any board
control or by any scruples about the legality of his drawings: para 208. He
used PRLÕs assets to fund his and his familyÕs personal expenditure,
including the substantial legal costs incurred in these proceedings. The
group was ÔÔe›ectively . . . the husbandÕs money box which he uses at willÕÕ:
para 218.

Piercing the corporate veil

16 I should Þrst of all draw attention to the limited sense in which this
issue arises at all.
ÔÔPiercing the corporate veilÕÕ is an expression rather
indiscriminately used to describe a number of di›erent things. Properly

speaking, it means disregarding the separate personality of the company.
There is a range of situations in which the law attributes the acts or property
of a company to those who control it, without disregarding its separate legal
personality. The controller may be personally liable, generally in addition to
the company, for something that he has done as its agent or as a joint actor.
Property legally vested in a company may belong beneÞcially to the
controller, if the arrangements in relation to the property are such as to make
the company its controllerÕs nominee or trustee for that purpose. For speciÞc
statutory purposes, a companyÕs legal responsibility may be engaged by the
acts or business of an associated company. Examples are the provisions of
the Companies Acts governing group accounts or the rules governing
infringements of competition law by ÔÔÞrmsÕÕ, which may include groups of
companies conducting the relevant business as an economic unit. Equitable
remedies, such as an injunction or speciÞc performance may be available to
compel the controller whose personal legal responsibility is engaged to
exercise his control in a particular way. But when we speak of piercing the
corporate veil, we are not (or should not be) speaking of any of these
situations, but only of those cases which are true exceptions to the rule in
Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd [1897] AC 22, i e where a person who owns
and controls a company is said in certain circumstances to be identiÞed with
it in law by virtue of that ownership and control.

17 Most advanced legal systems recognise corporate legal personality
while acknowledging some limits to its logical implications.
In civil law
jurisdictions, the juridical basis of the exceptions is generally the concept of
abuse of rights, to which the International Court of Justice was referring in
Case concerning Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Co Ltd (Belgium v
Spain) (Second Phase) [1970] ICJ Rep 3 when it derived from municipal law
a limited principle permitting the piercing of the corporate veil in cases of
misuse, fraud, malfeasance or evasion of legal obligations. These examples
illustrate the breadth, at least as a matter of legal theory, of the concept of
abuse of rights, which extends not just to the illegal and improper invocation
of a right but to its use for some purpose collateral to that for which it exists.
18 English law has no general doctrine of this kind. But it has a variety
of speciÞc principles which achieve the same result in some cases. One of
these principles is that
legal
relationships between persons (natural or artiÞcial) on the fundamental
assumption that their dealings are honest. The same legal incidents will not
necessarily apply if they are not. The principle was stated in its most
absolute form by Denning LJ in a famous dictum in Lazarus Estates Ltd v
Beasley [1956] 1 QB 702, 712:

the law deÞnes the incidents of most

ÔÔNo court in this land will allow a person to keep an advantage which
he has obtained by fraud. No judgment of a court, no order of a Minister,
can be allowed to stand if it has been obtained by fraud. Fraud unravels
everything. The court is careful not to Þnd fraud unless it is distinctly
pleaded and proved; but once it is proved, it vitiates judgments, contracts
and all transactions whatsoever . . .ÕÕ

The principle is mainly familiar in the context of contracts and other
consensual arrangements, in which the e›ect of fraud is to vitiate consent so
that the transaction becomes voidable ab initio. But it has been applied
altogether more generally, in cases which can be rationalised only on

grounds of public policy, for example to justify setting aside a public act such
as a judgment, which is in no sense consensual, a jurisdiction which has
existed since at least 1775: Duchess of KingstonÕs Case (1776) 2 SmithÕs LC
(13th ed) 644, 646, 651. Or to abrogate a right derived from a legal status,
such as marriage: R v Secretary of State for the Home Department,
Ex p Puttick [1981] QB 767. Or to disapply a statutory time bar which on
the face of the statute applies: Welwyn HatÞeld Borough Council v Secretary
of State for Communities and Local Government [2011] 2 AC 304. These
decisions (and there are others) illustrate a broader principle governing cases
in which the beneÞt of some apparently absolute legal principle has been
obtained by dishonesty. The authorities show that there are limited
circumstances in which the law treats the use of a company as a means of
evading the law as dishonest for this purpose.

19 The question is heavily burdened by authority, much of

it
characterised by incautious dicta and inadequate reasoning. I propose, Þrst,
to examine those cases which seek to rationalise the case law in terms of
general principle, and then to look at a number of cases in which the court
has been thought, rightly or wrongly, to have pierced the corporate veil in
order to identify the critical features of these cases which enabled them to do
so.

20 Almost all the modern analyses of the general principle have taken as
their starting point the brief and obiter but inßuential statement of Lord
Keith of Kinkel in Woolfson v Strathclyde Regional Council 1978 SC
(HL) 90. This was an appeal from Scotland in which the House of Lords
declined to allow the principal shareholder of a company to recover
compensation for the compulsory purchase of a property which the
company occupied. The case was decided on its facts, but at p 96, Lord
Keith, delivering the leading speech, observed that ÔÔit is appropriate to
pierce the corporate veil only where special circumstances exist indicating
that it is a mere facade concealing the true factsÕÕ.

21 The Þrst systematic analysis of the large and disparate body of
English case law was undertaken by a strong Court of Appeal in Adams v
Cape Industries plc [1990] Ch 433 (Slade, Mustill and Ralph Gibson LJJ).
The question at issue in that case was whether the United Kingdom parent of
an international mining group which was, at least arguably, managed as a
ÔÔsingle economic unitÕÕ was present in the United States for the purpose of
making a default judgment of a United States court enforceable against it in
England. Among other arguments, it was suggested that it was present in the
United States by virtue of the fact that a wholly owned subsidiary was
incorporated and carried on business there.
Slade LJ, delivering the
judgment of the court, rejected this contention: pp 532—544. The court,
adopting Lord KeithÕs dictum in Woolfson v Strathclyde, held that the
corporate veil could be disregarded only in cases where it was being used for
a deliberately dishonest purpose: pp 539, 540. Apart from that, and from
cases turning on the wording of particular statutes, it held at p 536 that:

ÔÔthe court is not free to disregard the principle of Salomon v
A Salomon & Co Ltd [1897] AC 22 merely because it considers that
justice so requires. Our law, for better or worse, recognises the creation
of subsidiary companies, which though in one sense the creatures of their
parent companies, will nevertheless under the general law fall to be

treated as separate legal entities with all the rights and liabilities which
would normally attach to separate legal entities.ÕÕ
22 In Trustor AB v Smallbone (No 2) [2001] 1 WLR 1177, Sir Andrew
Morritt V-C reviewed many of the same authorities. Mr Smallbone, the
former managing director of Trustor, had improperly procured large
amounts of its money to be paid out of its account to a company called
Introcom Ltd,
Introcom was owned and
controlled by a Liechtenstein trust of which Mr Smallbone was a beneÞciary.
Its directors acted on his instructions. At an earlier stage of the litigation,
Trustor had obtained summary judgment on some of its claims against
Introcom, on the footing that the payments were unauthorised and a breach
of Mr SmallboneÕs duty as managing director, that the company was ÔÔsimply
a vehicle Mr Smallbone used for receiving money from TrustorÕÕ, and that his
knowledge could be imputed to the company. The Vice-Chancellor was
dealing with a subsequent application by Trustor for summary judgment
against Mr Smallbone himself. It was accepted that there was an arguable
defence to the claims against him for damages or compensation for breach of
his duties as a director of Trustor. Accordingly the sole basis of the
application was that he was liable to account as a constructive trustee on the
footing of knowing receipt. This depended on the proposition that he was to
be identiÞed with Introcom and so treated as having received the money
himself. It was submitted that the authorities justiÞed piercing the corporate
veil in three, possibly overlapping, cases: (i) where the company was a
ÔÔfacade or shamÕÕ; (ii) where the company was involved in some form of
impropriety; and (iii) where it was necessary to do so in the interests of
justice. In each of these cases, the right of the court to pierce the corporate
veil was said to be subject to there being no third party interests engaged,
such as unconnected minority shareholders or creditors.
Sir Andrew
Morritt V-C concluded that the authorities supported the submission in
case (i), and also in case (ii) provided that the impropriety was a relevant
one, i e ÔÔlinked to the use of the company structure to avoid or conceal
liability for that improprietyÕÕ: para 22. He followed Adams v Cape
Industries plc in rejecting the submission as applied to case (iii).
In
summary, the court was ÔÔentitled to Ôpierce the corporate veilÕ and recognise
the receipt of the company as that of the individual(s) in control of it if the
company was used as a device or facade to conceal the true facts, thereby
avoiding or concealing any liability of those individual(s)ÕÕ: see para 23.

23 For years after it was decided, Adams v Cape Industries plc was
regarded as having settled the general law on the subject. But for much of
this period, the Family Division pursued an independent line, essentially for
reasons of policy arising from its concern to make e›ective its statutory
jurisdiction to distribute the property of the marriage on a divorce.
In
Nicholas v Nicholas [1984] FLR 285, the Court of Appeal (Cumming-Bruce
and Dillon LJJ) overturned the decision of the judge to order the husband to
procure the transfer to the wife of a property belonging to a company in
which he held a 71% shareholding, the other 29% being held by his business
associates. However, both members of the court suggested, obiter, that the
result might have been di›erent had it not been for the position of the
minority shareholders. Cumming-Bruce LJ, at p 287, thought that, in that
situation, ÔÔthe court does and will pierce the corporate veil and make an

order which has the same e›ect as an order that would be made if the
property was vested in the majority shareholder.ÕÕ Dillon LJ said, at p 292,
that ÔÔIf the company was [a] one-man company and the alter ego of the
husband, I would have no di–culty in holding that there was power to order
a transfer of the property.ÕÕ These dicta were subsequently applied by judges
of the Family Division dealing with claims for ancillary Þnancial relief, who
regularly made orders awarding to parties to the marriage assets vested in
companies of which one of them was the sole shareholder. Connell J made
such an order in Green v Green [1993] 1 FLR 326. In Mubarak v Mubarak
[2001] 1 FLR 673, 682C, Bodey J held that for the purpose of claims to
ancillary Þnancial relief the Family Division would lift the corporate veil not
only where the company was a sham but ÔÔwhen it is just and necessaryÕÕ, the
very proposition that the Court of Appeal had rejected as a statement of the
general law in Adams v Cape Industries plc [1990] Ch 433. And in Kremen
v Agrest (No 2) [2011] 2 FLR 490, para 46, Mostyn J held that there was a
ÔÔstrong practical reason why the cloak should be penetrable even absent a
Þnding of wrongdoingÕÕ.

24 There were of course dissenting voices, even in decisions on ancillary
relief. Much the most signiÞcant of them for present purposes was that of
Munby J. In A v A [2007] 2 FLR 467, paras 18—19, he drew attention to the
robust approach which had always been adopted by judges of the Family
Division in seeing through sham arrangements designed to hide the
ownership of assets of the marriage by vesting them in relatives or
companies which were in reality holding them as their nominees. But he
warned against departing from fundamental legal principle. He observed, at
para 21:

ÔÔIn this sense, and to this limited extent, the typical case in the Family
Division may di›er from the typical case in (say) the Chancery Division.
But what it is important to appreciate (and too often, I fear, is not
appreciated at least in this division) is that the relevant legal principles
which have to be applied are precisely the same in this division as in the
other two divisions. There is not one law of ÔshamÕ in the Chancery
Division and another law of ÔshamÕ in the Family Division. There is only
one law of ÔshamÕ, to be applied equally in all three divisions of the High
Court, just as there is but one set of principles, again equally applicable in
all three divisions, determining whether or not it is appropriate to Ôpierce
the corporate veil.Õ ÕÕ
25 In Ben Hashem v Al Shayif [2009] 1 FLR 115, another decision of
Munby J, the di›erence between the approach taken in the Family Division
and in other divisions of the High Court arose in a particularly acute form,
because he was hearing the claim for ancillary relief in conjunction with
proceedings in the Chancery Division. In the Family Division, the wife was
seeking an order transferring to her a property which she was occupying but
which was owned by a company controlled by the husband, while in the
Chancery proceedings the company was seeking a possession order in
respect of the same property. After reminding himself of what he had said in
A v A and conducting a careful review of both family and non-family cases,
Munby J formulated six principles at paras 159—164 which he considered
could be derived from them: (i) ownership and control of a company were
not enough to justify piercing the corporate veil; (ii) the court cannot pierce

the corporate veil, even in the absence of third party interests in the
company, merely because it is thought to be necessary in the interests of
justice; (iii) the corporate veil can be pierced only if there is some
impropriety;
the impropriety in question must, as Sir Andrew
Morritt V-C had said in the Trustor case [2001] 1 WLR 1177, be ÔÔlinked to
the use of the company structure to avoid or conceal liabilityÕÕ; (v) to justify
piercing the corporate veil, there must be ÔÔboth control of the company by
the wrongdoer(s) and impropriety, that is (mis)use of the company by them
as a device or facade to conceal their wrongdoingÕÕ; and (vi) the company
may be a ÔÔfacadeÕÕ even though it was not originally incorporated with any
deceptive intent, provided that it is being used for the purpose of deception
at the time of the relevant transactions. The court would, however, pierce
the corporate veil only so far as it was necessary in order to provide a remedy
for the particular wrong which those controlling the company had done.

26 In VTB Capital plc v Nutritek International Corpn [2012] 2 LloydÕs
Rep 313, VTB Capital sought permission to serve proceedings out of the
jurisdiction on the footing that the borrower under a facility agreement was
to be identiÞed with the persons who controlled it, so as to make the latter in
law parties to the same agreement. The attempt failed in the Court of
Appeal because the court was not satisÞed that
that would be the
consequence of piercing the corporate veil even if it were legitimate to do so:
see paras 90—91. The decision is not, therefore, direct authority on the
question whether the court was entitled to pierce the corporate veil. But the
court considered all the principal authorities on that question and arrived at
substantially the same conclusions as Sir Andrew Morritt V-C and Munby J.
Munby JÕs statement of principle was adopted by the Court of Appeal
subject to two qualiÞcations. First, they said that it was not necessary in
order to pierce the corporate veil that there should be no other remedy
available against the wrongdoer, and so far as Munby J suggested that it
was, he had set the bar too high. Secondly, they said that it was not enough
to show that there had been wrongdoing.

ÔÔThe relevant wrongdoing must be in the nature of an independent
wrong that involves the fraudulent or dishonest misuse of the corporate
personality of the company for the purpose of concealing the true factsÕÕ:
see paras 79—80.

On this point, the case took the same course in the Supreme Court [2013]
2 AC 337, which dismissed VTB CapitalÕs appeal. So far as piercing the
corporate veil
is concerned, the courtÕs reasons were given by Lord
Neuberger of Abbotsbury PSC. He noted the broad consensus among judges
and textbook writers that there were circumstances in which separate legal
personality of a company might be disregarded and the company identiÞed
with those who owned and controlled it. However, he declined to decide
whether the consensus was right on an appeal from an interlocutory
decision, given that, like the Court of Appeal, he considered that even if the
veil were pierced the result would not be to make a companyÕs controllers
party to its contracts with third parties. But he adopted, as it seems to me,
both the general reasoning of the Court of Appeal and the view of Munby J
that any doctrine permitting the court to pierce the corporate veil must be
limited to cases where there was a relevant impropriety: see paras 128, 145.

27 In my view, the principle that the court may be justiÞed in piercing
the corporate veil if a companyÕs separate legal personality is being abused
for the purpose of some relevant wrongdoing is well established in the
authorities.
It is true that most of the statements of principle in the
authorities are obiter, because the corporate veil was not pierced. It is also
true that most cases in which the corporate veil was pierced could have been
decided on other grounds. But the consensus that there are circumstances in
which the court may pierce the corporate veil is impressive. I would not for
my part be willing to explain that consensus out of existence. This is because
I think that the recognition of a limited power to pierce the corporate veil in
carefully deÞned circumstances is necessary if the law is not to be disarmed
in the face of abuse. I also think that provided the limits are recognised and
respected, it is consistent with the general approach of English law to the
problems raised by the use of legal concepts to defeat mandatory rules of
law.

28 The di–culty is to identify what

is a relevant wrongdoing.
References to a ÔÔfacadeÕÕ or ÔÔshamÕÕ beg too many questions to provide a
satisfactory answer.
It seems to me that two distinct principles lie behind
these protean terms, and that much confusion has been caused by failing to
distinguish between them. They can conveniently be called the concealment
principle and the evasion principle. The concealment principle is legally
banal and does not involve piercing the corporate veil at all. It is that the
interposition of a company or perhaps several companies so as to conceal the
identity of the real actors will not deter the courts from identifying them,
assuming that their identity is legally relevant. In these cases the court is not
disregarding the ÔÔfacadeÕÕ, but only looking behind it to discover the facts
which the corporate structure is concealing. The evasion principle is
di›erent.
It is that the court may disregard the corporate veil if there is a
legal right against the person in control of it which exists independently of
the companyÕs involvement, and a company is interposed so that the
separate legal personality of the company will defeat the right or frustrate its
enforcement. Many cases will fall
into both categories, but in some
circumstances the di›erence between them may be critical. This may be
illustrated by reference to those cases in which the court has been thought,
rightly or wrongly, to have pierced the corporate veil.

29 The Þrst and most famous of them is Gilford Motor Co Ltd v Horne
[1933] Ch 935. Mr E B Horne had been the managing director of the
Gilford Motor Co. His contract of employment precluded him being
engaged in any competing business in a speciÞed geographical area for Þve
years after the end of his employment ÔÔeither solely or jointly with or as
agent for any other person, Þrm or companyÕÕ. He left Gilford and carried on
a competing business in the speciÞed area, initially in his own name. He then
formed a company, JM Horne & Co Ltd, named after his wife, in which she
and a business associate were shareholders. The trial judge, Farwell J, found
that the company had been set up in this way to enable the business to be
carried on under his own control but without incurring liability for breach of
the covenant. However the reality, in his view, was that the company was
being used as ÔÔthe channel through which the defendant Horne was carrying
on his businessÕÕ: p 943. In fact, he dismissed the claim on the ground that
the restrictive covenant was void. But the Court of Appeal allowed the
appeal on that point and granted an injunction against both Mr Horne and

the company. As against Mr Horne, the injunction was granted on the
concealment principle. Lord Hanworth MR said, at pp 961—962, that the
company was a ÔÔmere cloak or shamÕÕ because the business was really being
carried on by Mr Horne. Because the restrictive covenant prevented
Mr Horne from competing with his former employers whether as principal
or as agent for another, it did not matter whether the business belonged to
him or to JM Horne & Co Ltd provided that he was carrying it on. The only
relevance of the interposition of the company was to maintain the pretence
that it was being carried on by others. Lord Hanworth MR did not explain
why the injunction should issue against the company, but I think it is clear
from the judgments of Lawrence and Romer LJJ, at pp 962 and 966, that
they were applying the evasion principle. Lawrence LJ, who gave the fullest
consideration to the point, based his view entirely on Mr HorneÕs evasive
motive for forming the company. This showed that it was

ÔÔa mere channel used by the defendant Horne for the purpose of
enabling him, for his own beneÞt, to obtain the advantage of the
customers of the plainti› company, and that therefore the defendant
company ought to be restrained as well as the defendant Horne.ÕÕ

In other words, the company was restrained in order to ensure that Horne
was deprived of the beneÞt which he might otherwise have derived from the
separate legal personality of the company. I agree with the view expressed
by the Court of Appeal in VTB Capital v Nutritek [2012] 2 LloydÕs Rep 313,
para 63, that this is properly to be regarded as a decision to pierce the
corporate veil.
It is fair to say that the point may have been conceded by
counsel, although in rather guarded terms (ÔÔif the evidence admitted of the
conclusion that what was being done was a mere cloak or shamÕÕ). It is also
true that the court in Gilford Motor Co Ltd v Horne [1933] Ch 935 might
have justiÞed the injunction against the company on the ground that
Mr HorneÕs knowledge was to be imputed to the company so as to make the
latterÕs conduct unconscionable or tortious, thereby justifying the grant of
an equitable remedy against it. But the case is authority for what it decided,
not for what it might have decided, and in my view the principle which the
Court of Appeal applied was correct. It does not follow that JM Horne &
Co Ltd was to be identiÞed with Mr Horne for any other purpose.
Mr HorneÕs personal creditors would not, for example, have been entitled
simply by virtue of the facts found by Farwell J, to enforce their claims
against the assets of the company.

30 Jones v Lipman [1962] 1 WLR 832 was a case of very much the same
kind. The facts were that Mr Lipman sold a property to the plainti›s for
£5,250 and then, thinking better of the deal, sold it to a company called
Alamed Ltd for £3,000, in order to make it impossible for the plainti›s to get
speciÞc performance. The judge, Russell J, found that company was wholly
owned and controlled by Mr Lipman, who had bought it o› the shelf and
had procured the property to be conveyed to it ÔÔsolely for the purpose of
defeating the plainti›sÕ rights to speciÞc performanceÕÕ. About half of the
purchase price payable by Alamed was funded by borrowing from a bank,
and the rest was left outstanding. The judge decreed speciÞc performance
against both Mr Lipman and Alamed Ltd. As against Mr Lipman this was
done on the concealment principle. Because Mr Lipman owned and
controlled Alamed Ltd, he was in a position speciÞcally to perform his

[2013] 2 AC

obligation to the plainti›s by exercising his powers over the company. This
did not involve piercing the corporate veil, but only identifying Mr Lipman
as the man in control of the company. The company, said Russell J
portentously at p 836, was ÔÔa device and a sham, a mask which [Mr Lipman]
holds before his face in an attempt to avoid recognition by the eye of equityÕÕ.
On the other hand, as against Alamed Ltd itself, the decision was justiÞed on
the evasion principle, by reference to the Court of AppealÕs decision in
Gilford Motor Co Ltd v Horne. The judge must have thought that in the
circumstances the company should be treated as having the same obligation
to convey the property to the plainti› as Mr Lipman had, even though it was
not party to the contract of sale. It should be noted that he decreed speciÞc
performance against the company notwithstanding that as a result of the
transaction, the companyÕs main creditor, namely the bank, was prejudiced
by its loss of what appears from the report to have been its sole asset apart
from a possible personal claim against Mr Lipman which he may or may not
have been in a position to meet. This may be thought hard on the bank, but
it is no harder than a Þnding that the company was not the beneÞcial owner
at all. The bank could have protected itself by taking a charge or registering
the contract of sale.

31 In Gencor ACP Ltd v Dalby [2000] 2 BCLC 734, the plainti› made a
large number of claims against a former director, Mr Dalby,
for
misappropriating its funds. For present purposes the claim which matters is
a claim for an account of a secret proÞt which Mr Dalby procured to be paid
by a third party, Balfour Beatty, to a British Virgin Island company under his
control called Burnstead. Rimer J held, at para 26, that Mr Dalby was
accountable for the money received by Burnstead, on the ground that the
latter was ÔÔin substance little other than Mr DalbyÕs o›shore bank account
held in a nominee nameÕÕ, and ÔÔsimply . . . the alter ego through which
Mr Dalby enjoyed the proÞt which he earned in breach of his Þduciary duty
to ACPÕÕ. Rimer J ordered an account against both Mr Dalby and Burnstead.
He considered that he was piercing the corporate veil. But I do not think
that he was. His Þndings about Mr DalbyÕs relationship with the company
and his analysis of the legal consequences show that both Mr Dalby and
Burnstead were independently liable to account to ACP, even on the footing
that they were distinct legal persons.
If, as the judge held, Burnstead was
Mr DalbyÕs nominee for the purpose of receiving and holding the secret
proÞt, it followed that Burnstead had no right to the money as against
Mr Dalby, who had in law received it through Burnstead and could properly
be required to account for it to ACP. Burnstead itself was liable to account to
ACP because, as the judge went on to point out, Mr DalbyÕs knowledge of
the prior equitable interest of ACP was to be imputed to it. As Rimer J
observed, ÔÔThe introduction into the story of such a creature company is . . .
insu–cient to prevent equityÕs eye from identifying it with Mr DalbyÕÕ. This
is in reality the concealment principle. The correct analysis of the situation
was that the court refused to be deterred by the legal personality of the
company from Þnding the true facts about its legal relationship with
Mr Dalby.
It held that the nature of their dealings gave rise to ordinary
equitable claims against both. The result would have been exactly the same
if Burnstead, instead of being a company, had been a natural person, say
Mr DalbyÕs uncle, about whose separate existence there could be no doubt.

32 The same confusion of concepts is, with respect, apparent in Sir
Andrew Morritt V-CÕs analysis in Trustor AB v Smallbone (No 2) [2001]
1 WLR 1177, which I have already considered. The Vice-ChancellorÕs
statement of principle at para 23 that the court was entitled to pierce the
corporate veil if the company was used as a ÔÔdevice or facade to conceal the
true facts thereby avoiding or concealing any liability of those individual(s)ÕÕ
elides the quite di›erent concepts of concealment and avoidance. As I read
his reasons for giving judgment against Mr Smallbone, at paras 24—25, he
did so on the concealment principle. It had been found at the earlier stage of
the litigation that Introcom was ÔÔsimply a vehicle Mr Smallbone used for
receiving money from TrustorÕÕ, and that the company was a ÔÔdevice or
facadeÕÕ for concealing that fact. On that footing, the company received the
money on Mr SmallboneÕs behalf. This conclusion did not involve piercing
the corporate veil, and did not depend on any Þnding of impropriety. It was
simply an application of the principle summarised by the Sir Andrew
Morritt V-C at para 19 of his judgment, that receipt by a company will count
as receipt by the shareholder if the company received it as his agent or
nominee, but not if it received it in its own right. To decide that question, it
was necessary to establish the facts which demonstrated the true legal
relationship between Mr Smallbone and Introcom. Mr SmallboneÕs
ownership and control of Introcom was only one of those facts, not in itself
conclusive. Other factors included the circumstances and the source of the
receipt, and the nature of the companyÕs other transactions if any.

33 In the Trustor case, as in the Gencor case, the analysis would have
been the same if Introcom had been a natural person instead of a company.
The evasion principle was not engaged, and indeed could not have been
engaged on the facts of either case. This is because neither Mr Dalby nor
Mr Smallbone had used the companyÕs separate legal personality to evade a
liability that they would otherwise have had. They were liable to account
only if the true facts were that the company had received the money as their
agent or nominee. That was proved in both cases. If it had not been, there
would have been no receipt, knowing or otherwise, and therefore no claim
to be evaded. The situation was not the same as it had been in Gilford Motor
Co v Horne [1933] Ch 935 and Jones v Lipman [1962] 1 WLR 832, for in
these cases the real actors, Mr Horne and Mr Lipman, had a liability which
arose independently of the involvement of the company.

34 These considerations reßect the broader principle that the corporate
veil may be pierced only to prevent the abuse of corporate legal personality.
It may be an abuse of the separate legal personality of a company to use it to
evade the law or to frustrate its enforcement. It is not an abuse to cause a
legal liability to be incurred by the company in the Þrst place. It is not an
abuse to rely on the fact (if it is a fact) that a liability is not the controllerÕs
because it is the companyÕs. On the contrary, that is what incorporation is
all about. Thus in a case like VTB Capital v Nutritek [2012] 2 LloydÕs Rep
313; [2013] 2 AC 337, where the argument was that the corporate veil
should be pierced so as to make the controllers of a company jointly and
severally liable on the companyÕs contract, the fundamental objection to the
argument was that the principle was being invoked so as to create a new
liability that would not otherwise exist. The objection to that argument is
obvious in the case of a consensual liability under a contract, where the
ostensible contracting parties never intended that any one else should be

[2013] 2 AC

party to it. But the objection would have been just as strong if the liability in
question had not been consensual.

35 I conclude that there is a limited principle of English law which
applies when a person is under an existing legal obligation or liability or
subject to an existing legal restriction which he deliberately evades or whose
enforcement he deliberately frustrates by interposing a company under his
control. The court may then pierce the corporate veil for the purpose, and
only for the purpose, of depriving the company or its controller of the
advantage that they would otherwise have obtained by the companyÕs
separate legal personality. The principle is properly described as a limited
one, because in almost every case where the test is satisÞed, the facts will in
practice disclose a legal relationship between the company and its controller
which will make it unnecessary to pierce the corporate veil. Like Munby J in
Ben Hashem v Al Shayif [2009] 1 FLR 115, I consider that if it is not necessary
to pierce the corporate veil, it is not appropriate to do so, because on that
footing there is no public policy imperative which justiÞes that course.
I therefore disagree with the Court of Appeal in VTB Capital v Nutritek
[2012] 2 LloydÕs Rep 313 who suggested otherwise at para 79. For all of these
reasons, the principle has been recognised far more often than it has been
applied. But the recognition of a small residual category of cases where the
abuse of the corporate veil to evade or frustrate the law can be addressed only
by disregarding the legal personality of the company is, I believe, consistent
with authority and with long-standing principles of legal policy.

36 In the present case, Moylan J held that he could not pierce the
corporate veil under the general law without some relevant impropriety, and
declined to Þnd that there was any. In my view he was right about this. The
husband has acted improperly in many ways.
In the Þrst place, he has
misapplied the assets of his companies for his own beneÞt, but in doing that he
was neither concealing nor evading any legal obligation owed to his wife.
Nor, more generally, was he concealing or evading the law relating to the
distribution of assets of a marriage on its dissolution. It cannot follow that
the court should disregard the legal personality of the companies with the
same insouciance as he did. Secondly, the husband has made use of the
opacity of the Petrodel GroupÕs corporate structure to deny being its owner.
But that, as the judge pointed out, at para 219, ÔÔis simply [the] husband giving
false evidenceÕÕ. It may engage what I have called the concealment principle,
but that simply means that the court must ascertain the truth that he has
concealed, as it has done. The problem in the present case is that the legal
interest in the properties is vested in the companies and not in the husband.
They were vested in the companies long before the marriage broke up.
Whatever the husbandÕs reasons for organising things in that way, there is no
evidence that he was seeking to avoid any obligation which is relevant in these
proceedings. The judge found that his purpose was ÔÔwealth protection and
the avoidance of taxÕÕ: para 218. It follows that the piercing of the corporate
veil cannot be justiÞed in this case by reference to any general principle of law.

Section 24(1)(a) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973

37 If there is no justiÞcation as a matter of general legal principle for
piercing the corporate veil, I Þnd it impossible to say that a special and wider
principle applies in matrimonial proceedings by virtue of section 24(1)(a) of
the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. The language of this provision is clear. It

empowers the court to order one party to the marriage to transfer to the
other ÔÔproperty to which the Þrst-mentioned party is entitled, either in
possession or reversionÕÕ. An ÔÔentitlementÕÕ is a legal right in respect of the
property in question. The words ÔÔin possession or reversionÕÕ show that the
right in question is a proprietary right, legal or equitable. This section is
invoking concepts with an established legal meaning and recognised legal
incidents under the general law. Courts exercising family jurisdiction do not
occupy a desert island in which general legal concepts are suspended or
mean something di›erent.
If a right of property exists, it exists in every
division of the High Court and in every jurisdiction of the county courts. If it
does not exist, it does not exist anywhere. It is right to add that even where
courts exercising family jurisdiction have claimed a wider jurisdiction to
pierce the corporate veil than would be recognised under the general law,
they have not usually suggested that this can be founded on section 24 of the
Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. On the contrary, in Nicholas v Nicholas
[1984] FLR 285, 288, Cumming-Bruce LJ said that it could not.

38 This analysis is not a›ected by section 25(2)(a) of the Matrimonial
Causes Act 1973. Section 25(2)(a) requires the court when exercising the
powers under section 24, to have regard to the ÔÔincome, earning capacity,
property and other Þnancial resources which each of the parties to the
marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable futureÕÕ. The breadth and
inclusiveness of this deÞnition of the relevant resources of the parties to the
marriage means that the relevant spouseÕs ownership and control of a
company and practical ability to extract money or moneyÕs worth from it are
unquestionably relevant to the courtÕs assessment of what his resources
really are. That may a›ect the amount of any lump sum or periodical
payment orders, or the decision what transfers to order of other property
which unquestionably belongs to the relevant spouse. But it does not follow
from the fact that one spouseÕs worth may be boosted by his access to the
companyÕs assets that those assets are speciÞcally transferrable to the other
under section 24(1)(a).

39 Moylan J considered that it was enough to justify his order to
transfer the properties that the husband should have the practical ability to
procure their transfer, whether or not he was their beneÞcial owner. He
found that this was established in the present case because of the power
which the husband had over the companies by virtue of owning and
controlling them. The judge did not make any Þnding about whether the
properties of the corporate respondents were held in trust for the husband,
except in the case of the matrimonial home in Warwick Avenue, which he
found to be beneÞcially his. What he held was that the assets of the
companies were ÔÔe›ectivelyÕÕ the husbandÕs property, because he treated
them as such. He was ÔÔable to procure their disposal as he may direct, based
again on his being the controller of the companies and the only beneÞcial
ownerÕÕ: para 210. The judge accepted that as a matter of company law, the
husband as shareholder had no more than a right of participation in
accordance with the companyÕs constitution, and that that did not confer
any right to any particular property of the company.
ÔÔBut, what if the
shareholder is, in fact, able to procure the transfer to them of a particular
item of company property, such as a matrimonial home,ÕÕ the judge asked,
ÔÔas a result of their control and ownership of the company and the absence
of any third party interests.ÕÕ The judgeÕs answer to that question was that

[2013] 2 AC

the ÔÔpurpose and intentionÕÕ of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 was that
the companiesÕ assets should be treated as part of the marital wealth.
ÔÔE›ectivelyÕÕ, he said, ÔÔthe husband, in respect of the companies and their
assets, is in the same position he would be in if he was the beneÞciary of a
bare trust or the companies were his nomineesÕÕ: para 225.

40 I do not accept this, any more than the Court of Appeal did. The
judge was entitled to take account of the husbandÕs ownership and control of
the companies and his unrestricted access to the companiesÕ assets in
assessing what his resources were for the purpose of section 25(2)(a). But he
was not entitled to order the companiesÕ assets to be transferred to the wife in
satisfaction of the lump sum order simply by virtue of section 24(1)(a). I do
not doubt that the construction of section 24(1)(a) of the Act is informed by
its purpose and its social context, as well as by its language. Nor do I doubt
that the object is to achieve a proper division of the assets of the marriage.
But it does not follow that the courts will stop at nothing in their pursuit of
that end, and there are a number of principled reasons for declining to give
the section the e›ect that the judge gave it. In the Þrst place, it is axiomatic
that general words in a statute are not to be read in a way which ÔÔwould
overthrow fundamental principles, infringe rights, or depart from the general
system of law, without expressing its intention with irresistible clearnessÕÕ.
The words are those of Lord Atkin in Nokes v Doncaster Amalgamated
Collieries Ltd [1940] AC 1014, 1031—1032, but the principle is very familiar
and has been restated by the courts in many contexts and at every level.
There is nothing in the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 and nothing in its
purpose or broader social context to indicate that the legislature intended to
authorise the transfer by one party to the marriage to the other of property
which was not his to transfer. Secondly, a transfer of this kind will ordinarily
be unnecessary for the purpose of achieving a fair distribution of the assets of
the marriage. Where assets belong to a company owned by one party to the
marriage, the proper claims of the other can ordinarily be satisÞed by
directing the transfer of the shares.
It is true that this will not always be
possible, particularly in cases like this one where the shareholder and the
company are both resident abroad in places which may not give direct e›ect
to the orders of the English court. In an age of internationally mobile spouses
and assets this is a more signiÞcant problem than it once was, but such cases
remain the exception rather than the rule. Section 24 cannot be construed as
if it were directed to that problem. Third, so far as a party to matrimonial
proceedings deliberately attempts to frustrate the exercise of the courtÕs
ancillary powers by disposing of assets, section 37 provides for the setting
aside of those dispositions in certain circumstances. Section 37 is a limited
provision which is very far from being a complete answer to the problem, but
it is as far as the legislature has been prepared to go.

These include elaborate provisions

in this case would cut across the statutory schemes of company and

regulating the
repayment of capital to shareholders and other forms of reduction of capital,
and for the recovery in an insolvency of improper dispositions of the
companyÕs assets. These schemes are essential for the protection of those
dealing with a company, particularly where it is a trading company like PRL
and Vermont. The e›ect of the judgeÕs order in this case was to make the
wife a secured creditor. It is no answer to say, as occasionally has been said

in cases about ancillary Þnancial relief, that the court will allow for known
creditors. The truth is that in the case of a trading company incurring and
discharging large liabilities in the ordinary course of business, a court of
family jurisdiction is not in a position to conduct the kind of notional
liquidation attended by detailed internal investigation and wide publicity
which would be necessary to establish what its liabilities are. In the present
case, the di–culty is aggravated by the fact that the last Þnancial statements,
which are not obviously unreliable, are more than Þve years old. To some
extent that is the fault of the husband and his companies, but that is unlikely
to be much comfort to unsatisÞed creditors with no knowledge of the state of
the shareholderÕs marriage or the proceedings in the Family Division. It is
clear from the judgeÕs Þndings of fact that this particular husband made free
with the companyÕs assets as if they were his own. That was within his
power, in the sense that there was no one to stop him. But, as the judge
observed, he never stopped to think whether he had any right to act in this
way, and in law, he had none. The sole shareholder or the whole body of
shareholders may approve a foolish or negligent decision in the ordinary
course of business, at least where the company is solvent: Multinational Gas
and Petrochemical Co v Multinational Gas and Petrochemical Services Ltd
[1983] Ch 258. But not even they can validly consent to their own
appropriation of the companyÕs assets for purposes which are not the
companyÕs: Belmont Finance Corpn Ltd v Williams Furniture Ltd [1979] Ch
250, 261 (Buckley LJ), Attorney GeneralÕs Reference (No 2 of 1982) [1984]
QB 624, R v Gomez [1993] AC 442, 496—497 (Lord Browne-Wilkinson).
Mr Prest is of course not the Þrst person to ignore the separate personality of
his company and pillage its assets, and he will certainly not be the last. But
for the court to deploy its authority to authorise the appropriation of the
companyÕs assets to satisfy a personal liability of its shareholder to his wife,
in circumstances where the company has not only not consented to that
course but vigorously opposed it, would, as it seems to me, be an even more
remarkable break with principle.

42 It may be said, as the judge in e›ect did say, that the way in which the
a›airs of this company were conducted meant that the corporate veil had no
reality. The problem about this is that if, as the judge thought, the property
of a company is property to which its sole shareholder is ÔÔentitled, either in
possession or reversionÕÕ, then that will be so even in a case where the sole
shareholder scrupulously respects the separate personality of the company
and the requirements of the Companies Acts, and even in a case where none
of the exceptional circumstances that may justify piercing the corporate veil
applies. This is a proposition which can be justiÞed only by asserting that
the corporate veil does not matter where the husband is in sole control of the
company. But that is plainly not the law.

BeneÞcial ownership of the properties

43 It follows from the above analysis that the only basis on which the
companies can be ordered to convey the seven disputed properties to the
wife is that they belong beneÞcially to the husband, by virtue of the
particular circumstances in which the properties came to be vested in them.
Only then will they constitute property to which the husband is ÔÔentitled,
either in possession or reversionÕÕ. This is the issue which the judge felt that
he did not need to decide. But on the footing that he was wrong about the

[2013] 2 AC

ambit of section 24(1)(a), it does need to be decided now. The issue requires
an examination of evidence which is incomplete and in critical respects
obscure. A good deal therefore depends on what presumptions may
properly be made against the husband given that the defective character of
the material
is almost entirely due to his persistent obstruction and
mendacity.

44 In Herrington v British Railways Board [1972] AC 877, 930—931,
Lord Diplock, dealing with the liability of a railway undertaking for injury
su›ered by trespassers on the line, said:

ÔÔThe appellants, who are a public corporation, elected to call no
witnesses, thus depriving the court of any positive evidence as to whether
the condition of the fence and the adjacent terrain had been noticed by any
particular servant of theirs or as to what he or any other of their servants
either thought or did about it. This is a legitimate tactical move under our
adversarial system of litigation. But a defendant who adopts it cannot
complain if the court draws from the facts which have been disclosed all
reasonable inferences as to what are the facts which the defendant has
chosen to withhold. A court may take judicial notice that railway lines are
regularly patrolled by linesmen and Bangers. In the absence of evidence to
the contrary, it is entitled to infer that one or more of them in the course of
several weeks noticed what was plain for all to see. Anyone of common
sense would realise the danger that the state of the fence so close to the live
rail created for little children coming to the meadow to play. As the
appellants elected to call none of the persons who patrolled the line there
is nothing to rebut the inference that they did not lack the common sense
to realise the danger. A court is accordingly entitled to infer from the
inaction of the appellants that one or more of their employees decided to
allow the risk to continue of some child crossing the boundary and being
injured or killed by the live rail rather than to incur the trivial trouble and
expense of repairing the gap in the fence.ÕÕ

The courts have tended to recoil from some of the Þercer parts of this
statement, which appear to convert open-ended speculation into Þndings of
fact. There must be a reasonable basis for some hypothesis in the evidence or
the inherent probabilities, before a court can draw useful inferences from a
partyÕs failure to rebut it. For my part I would adopt, with a modiÞcation
which I shall come to, the more balanced view expressed by Lord Lowry
with the support of the rest of the committee in R v Inland Revenue Comrs,
Ex p TC Coombs & Co [1991] 2 AC 283, 300:

ÔÔIn our legal system generally, the silence of one party in face of the
other partyÕs evidence may convert that evidence into proof in relation to
matters which are, or are likely to be, within the knowledge of the silent
party and about which that party could be expected to give evidence.
Thus, depending on the circumstances, a prima facie case may become a
strong or even an overwhelming case. But, if the silent partyÕs failure to
give evidence (or to give the necessary evidence) can be credibly
explained, even if not entirely justiÞed, the e›ect of his silence in favour of
the other party, may be either reduced or nulliÞed.ÕÕ

45 The modiÞcation to which I have referred concerns the drawing of
adverse inferences in claims for ancillary Þnancial relief in matrimonial
proceedings, which have some important distinctive features. There is a
public interest in the proper maintenance of the wife by her former husband,
especially (but not only) where the interests of the children are engaged. Partly
for that reason, the proceedings although in form adversarial have a
substantial inquisitorial element. The family Þnances will commonly have
been the responsibility of the husband, so that although technically a claimant,
the wife is in reality dependent on the disclosure and evidence of the husband
to ascertain the extent of her proper claim. The concept of the burden of proof,
which has always been one of the main factors inhibiting the drawing of
adverse inferences from the absence of evidence or disclosure, cannot be
applied in the same way to proceedings of this kind as it is in ordinary civil
litigation. These considerations are not a licence to engage in pure
speculation. But judges exercising family jurisdiction are entitled to draw on
their experience and to take notice of the inherent probabilities when deciding
what an uncommunicative husband is likely to be concealing. I refer to the
husband because the husband is usually the economically dominant party, but
of course the same applies to the economically dominant spouse whoever it is.
46 The facts, so far as the judge was able to make Þndings about them,

are that the London properties were acquired as follows:

Flat 4, 27, Abbey Road was transferred to PRL by the
husband for £1. It had been bought by him in 1991,
before the marriage and before the incorporation of PRL.
There are two charges on the property, in favour of Ahli
United Bank and BNP Paribas, apparently to secure loans
made to PRL. Neither the husband nor PRL has
complied with orders to disclose the loan agreement and
related documents.
Flat 5, 27, Abbey Road was transferred to PRL on the
same day, also for £1, by the husbandÕs younger brother
Michel. It had been bought in March of that year for
£48,650 in MichelÕs name. The wifeÕs evidence was that,
at the time, Michel was a student in London with no
substantial assets of his own who was being supported by
her husband. She said that her husband had led her to
believe that he had paid for it.
Flat 2, 143, Ashmore Road, is a leasehold property
transferred to PRL for £1 by the wife. It had originally been
bought by the husband in November 1992 in the name of
someone called Jimmy Lawrence. There is no information
about Jimmy Lawrence or the reasons for his involvement.
According to the husbandÕs evidence, the purchase money
came from PRL, but since PRL was not incorporated until
six months after that, this cannot be correct. At some stage,
it is unclear when or how, the lease was transferred into the
name of the wife, and she must have signed the transfer
when it was conveyed to PRL, but she had no recollection
of being involved or of ever having owned it.

The wife transferred her interest in the freehold of
143, Ashmore Street to PRL. The freehold had originally
been bought in 1996 in the name of the wife and one Esta
Blechman, who was the leasehold owner of another ßat in
the building. There is no information about the
consideration paid either in 1996 or in 1998. The
husbandÕs evidence was the funds to buy the wifeÕs
interest in 1996 came from PRL.
Flat 6, 62—64, Beethoven Street was transferred to PRL by
the husband for £85,000. He had originally bought it in
1988 (before the marriage) for £70,500. The property is
charged to secure the loans made by Ahli United Bank
and BNP Paribas.
The matrimonial home, 16, Warwick Avenue, was
bought in the name of PRL for £1.4m and subsequently
refurbished at a cost of about £1m. The judge rejected
the husbandÕs evidence that the purchase price and
refurbishment costs were funded by PRL, because at that
stage the company had not commenced trading
operations. He found that they were funded from
bonuses earned by the husband, presumably, at this stage,
from his last employer before he set up on his own. The
judge found that PRL had always held this property on
trust for the husband and that conclusion is not
challenged on this appeal. The property is charged to
secure the loans made by Ahli United Bank and BNP
Paribas. In accordance with the judgeÕs order PRL has
now conveyed it to the wife, but subject to the charges.
Flat 310, Pavilion Apartments was bought in the name of
Vermont for £635,000. The judge found that the money
was derived from PRL.
11 South Lodge, Circus Road, was bought in the name of
Vermont for £700,000. The judge found that the
purchase price was also derived from PRL. The property
is charged to secure the loans made to Ahli United Bank
and BNP Paribas.

The judge recorded the wifeÕs evidence that the husband had once advised
her that if anything were to happen to him, she should sell all the properties,
move to Nevis and use the proceeds of sale to meet her living expenses there.
47 The starting point is that in her points of claim the wife expressly
alleged, among other things, that the husband used the corporate defendants
to hold legal title to properties that belonged beneÞcially to him. All seven of
the properties in dispute on this appeal were identiÞed in her pleading as
having been held for him in this way. In her section 25 statement, she gives
evidence of her belief that he was their beneÞcial owner, supported in
some cases by admittedly inconclusive reasons for that belief. Neither the
husband nor the companies have complied with orders for the production of
the completion statements on the purchase of the properties and evidence of
the source of the money used to pay the purchase price. The companies were

joined to these proceedings only because they were alleged to be trustees for
the husband of the shareholdings and the properties and because orders were
being sought for their transfer to the wife. Yet the companies failed to Þle a
defence, or to comply with orders for disclosure. One of the few things that
is clear from Mr MurphyÕs a–davit was that the companiesÕ refusal to
co-operate was deliberate, notwithstanding that they were conscious that
the London properties (unlike the other assets) were within the jurisdiction
of the court, which was in a position directly to enforce any order that it
might make in respect of them. The only explanation pro›ered for their
contumacy was that the information was conÞdential to the companiesÕ
shareholders or ÔÔcommercial partnersÕÕ.
It is di–cult to imagine that any
commercial partners could enjoy rights of conÞdence over information
concerning residential investment properties in London, and on the judgeÕs
Þndings the only shareholder was the husband himself. The only directly
relevant evidence given by Mr Murphy in his a–davit is a bald assertion that
the companies are the sole beneÞcial owners of the shareholdings and the
properties, but he declined to appear for cross-examination on it. The judge
rejected his explanation that his health was not up to it. The judgeÕs Þndings
about the ownership and control of the companies mean that the companiesÕ
refusal to co-operate with these proceedings is a course ultimately adopted
on the direction of the husband.
It is a fair inference from all these facts,
taken cumulatively, that the main, if not the only, reason for the companiesÕ
failure to co-operate is to protect the London properties. That in turn
suggests that proper disclosure of the facts would reveal them to have been
held beneÞcially by the husband, as the wife has alleged.

48 Turning to what is known about the acquisition of the disputed
properties, PRL acquired the legal
interest in six London properties
(including the matrimonial home) between 1995 and 2001. All of these
properties were acquired by PRL before it began commercial operations and
began to generate funds of its own. This was the main basis on which the
judge found that the matrimonial home was held on trust for the husband
from its acquisition in 2001. Since, as the judge found, no rent was paid to
PRL for the familyÕs occupation of the matrimonial home, this is a
particularly clear case of the husband using PRL as a vehicle to hold legal
title on trust for himself.

49 Of the other Þve properties owned by PRL, the Þrst category
comprises the three properties (Flats 4 and 5, 27, Abbey Road, and Flat 2,
143, Ashmore Road) acquired by the company in December 1995 and
March 1996, in each case for a nominal consideration of £1. Since no
explanation has been forthcoming for the gratuitous transfer of these
properties to PRL, there is nothing to rebut the ordinary presumption of
equity that PRL was not intended to acquire a beneÞcial interest in them.
The only question is who did hold the beneÞcial interest. Flat 4, 27, Abbey
Road was transferred by the husband, who had originally bought it in his
own name in 1991, before PRL was incorporated. There is therefore an
ordinary resulting trust back to the husband, which is held by him subject to
the charges in favour of Ahli United Bank and BNP Paribas. Flat 5,
27, Abbey Road was transferred to PRL by the husbandÕs younger brother
Michel. He had acquired title shortly before at a time when he could not
have paid for it himself. The wifeÕs evidence was that the husband paid for
it. Again, there is no evidence to rebut the ordinary inference that the

husband was the beneÞcial owner of the property at the time of the transfer
to PRL, and that the company held it on a resulting trust for him. The
leasehold interest in Flat 2, 143, Ashmore Road was transferred to PRL by
the wife. The rather curious chain of title before that is summarised above.
The circumstances suggest that the husband must have provided the
purchase money and was the beneÞcial owner when the legal estate was held
by Jimmy Lawrence and also at the time of its transfer from him to the wife.
Either it then became the beneÞcial property of the wife (which is what
equity would initially presume); or else it remained in the beneÞcial
ownership of the husband, which is what I would on balance infer from the
wifeÕs evidence that the transfer was procured by the husband without her
conscious involvement. In either case, the company as the legal owner can
be required to transfer this property to the wife. I conclude that the husband
was at all relevant times the beneÞcial owner of all three properties.

in 143, Ashmore Road and Flat 6,

Flat 6,
62—64, Beethoven Street is known to have been acquired by PRL from the
husband in August 1998 for substantial consideration. Since PRL had not
begun operations at that stage, I infer that the purchase money must have
come from the husband. Virtually nothing is known about the terms of
acquisition of the wifeÕs interest in the freehold of 143, Ashmore Road,
except that the husband says that the money came from PRL. I infer for the
same reason that PRL was funded by the husband. In itself, that is consistent
with PRL being the beneÞcial owner if, for example, the husband provided
the money to the company by way of loan or capital subscription. But there
is no evidence to that e›ect, and I would not be willing to presume it in the
absence of any.
I conclude that the husband was the beneÞcial owner of
these two properties.

(Flat 310, Pavilion
Apartments and 11 South Lodge, Circus Road) which were acquired in the
name of Vermont for substantial consideration, in July 2001 and January
2004 respectively. Vermont is an oil trading company which according to
the husband started lifting oil
In the companyÕs Þnancial
statements for 2008, the two properties are listed as its only assets and there
were no liabilities apart from the bank loans charged on Flat 310, Pavilion
Apartments. Flat 310, Pavilion Apartments was acquired with funds derived
from PRL at a time when the company had not begun trading operations.
I infer that the funds were provided to PRL by the husband. The position is
the same in the case of 11 South Lodge, except that this was bought with
money provided by PRL at a time when it was an active trading company
and could therefore have funded the purchase itself. However, it is right to
note (i) that the ownership of residential investment property in London
appears to have nothing to do with the oil trading business in which PRL
was then engaged, and (ii) that at this stage of the history a consistent pattern
can be discerned by which the husband causes properties to be acquired with
funds provided by himself by companies under his control, nominally
funded by PRL but in fact by himself. If 11 South Lodge was the exception,
then it was a break with past practice. In the absence of any explanation of
these transactions by the husband or his companies, I conclude that both of
the properties acquired in the name of Vermont were beneÞcially owned by
the husband.

52 Whether assets legally vested in a company are beneÞcially owned by
its controller is a highly fact-speciÞc issue. It is not possible to give general
guidance going beyond the ordinary principles and presumptions of equity,
especially those relating to gifts and resulting trusts. But I venture to suggest,
however tentatively, that in the case of the matrimonial home, the facts are
quite likely to justify the inference that the property was held on trust for a
spouse who owned and controlled the company.
In many, perhaps most
cases, the occupation of the companyÕs property as the matrimonial home of
its controller will not be easily justiÞed in the companyÕs interest, especially
if it is gratuitous. The intention will normally be that the spouse in control
of the company intends to retain a degree of control over the matrimonial
home which is not consistent with the companyÕs beneÞcial ownership. Of
course, structures can be devised which give a di›erent impression, and
some of them will be entirely genuine. But where, say, the terms of
acquisition and occupation of the matrimonial home are arranged between
the husband in his personal capacity and the husband in his capacity as the
sole e›ective agent of the company (or someone else acting at his direction),
judges exercising family jurisdiction are entitled to be sceptical about
whether the terms of occupation are really what they are said to be, or are
simply a sham to conceal the reality of the husbandÕs beneÞcial ownership.

Terms for permission to appeal

54 Before parting with this case, I will only record my surprise that the
companies were given permission to appeal on such undemanding terms.
They were required to make a payment on account of costs, but they were
not required to purge their contempt in failing to disclose documents or
information, nor were they put on terms as to dealings with the properties.
There may have been good reasons for not imposing such terms, but on the
face of it the possibility was not even considered.

Conclusion

55 I would accordingly declare that the seven disputed properties vested
in PRL and Vermont are held on trust for the husband, and I would restore
para 6 of the order of Moylan J so far as it required those companies to
transfer them to the wife.

56 Subject to any contrary submissions as to costs, I would also restore
para 14 of the judgeÕs order so far as it dealt with the costs payable by PRL
and Vermont, and would order them to pay the costs of the appeal to the
Court of Appeal and to this court. As at present advised, I would not require
Upstream, against whom no relief has ever been sought, to pay any costs, but
in the rather unusual circumstances of this case, I would not make any costs
order in their favour either.

57 I agree that Mrs PrestÕs appeal succeeds. More particularly, I agree
that her appeal should be (i) allowed on the basis that the properties were
acquired and held by the respondent companies on trust for the husband, but
(ii) dismissed in so far as it relies on piercing the veil of incorporation, or on
section 24(1)(a) or (c) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973.

58 I agree with all that Lord Sumption JSC says on (i) the construction
of section 24(1)(a) of the 1973 Act, in paras 37—42, (ii) the trust issue, in his
masterly analysis of the facts and inferences to be drawn from them, in
paras 43—52, (iii) the point sought to be raised under section 24(1)(c), in
para 53, and (iv) his conclusions in paras 55 and 56, and there is nothing
I wish to add on those issues.

59 I wish, however, to add a little to what Lord Sumption JSC says on
the question of whether, and if so, in what circumstances, the court has
power to pierce the corporate veil in the absence of speciÞc statutory
authority to do so.

60 I agree that there are two types of case where judges have described
their decisions as being based on piercing the veil, namely those concerned
with concealment and those concerned with evasion.
It seems to me that
Staughton LJ had a similar classiÞcation in mind in Atlas Maritime Co SA v
Avalon Maritime Ltd (No 1) [1991] 4 All ER 769, 779G (quoted in VTB
Capital plc v Nutritek International Corpn [2013] 2 AC 337, para 118),
where he sought to distinguish between ÔÔliftingÕÕ and ÔÔpiercingÕÕ the
corporate veil.

61 I also agree that cases concerned with concealment do not involve
piercing the corporate veil at all. They simply involve the application of
conventional legal principles to an arrangement which happens to include a
company being interposed to disguise the true nature of that arrangement.
Accordingly, if piercing the corporate veil has any role to play, it is in
connection with evasion.

62 Furthermore, I agree that, if the court has power to pierce the
corporate veil, Munby J was correct in Ben Hashem v Al Shayif [2009]
1 FLR 115 to suggest that it could only do so in favour of a party when all
other, more conventional, remedies have proved to be of no assistance (and
therefore I disagree with the Court of Appeal in VTB Capital v Nutritek
[2012] 2 LloydÕs Rep 313, para 79, who suggested otherwise).

63 However, as in the recent decision of this court in VTB v Nutritek, it
is not necessary to decide whether there is a principle that it is open to a
court, without statutory authority (or, possibly, in the absence of the
intention of contracting parties), to pierce the veil of incorporation (ÔÔthe
doctrineÕÕ), and, if it is, the scope, or boundaries, of the doctrine.

64 However, I can see considerable force in the view that it is
appropriate for us to address those matters now. This is the second case in
the space of a few months when the doctrine has been invoked before this
court on what are, on any view, inappropriate grounds. It is also clear from
the cases and academic articles that the law relating to the doctrine is
unsatisfactory and confused. Those cases and articles appear to me to
suggest that (i) there is not a single instance in this jurisdiction where the
doctrine has been invoked properly and successfully, (ii) there is doubt as to
whether the doctrine should exist, and (iii) it is impossible to discern any

coherent approach, applicable principles, or deÞned limitations to the
doctrine.

65 In these circumstances, there is obvious value in seeking to decide
whether the doctrine exists, and if so, to identify some coherent, practical
and principled basis for it, if we can do so in this case.

66 Any discussion about the doctrine must begin with the decision in
Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd [1897] AC 22, in which a unanimous
House of Lords reached a clear and principled decision, which has stood
unimpeached for over a century. The e›ect of the decision is encapsulated at
pp 30—31, where Lord Halsbury LC said that a ÔÔlegally incorporatedÕÕ
company ÔÔmust be treated like any other independent person with its rights
and liabilities appropriate to itself . . . , whatever may have been the ideas or
schemes of those who brought it
is
characterised as a common law rule or a consequence of the companies
legislation (or an amalgam of both), it is a very well established principle of
long standing and high authority. Writing extrajudicially, Lord Templeman
referred to the principle in the Salomon case as the ÔÔunyielding rockÕÕ on
which company law is constructed, and on which ÔÔcomplicated argumentsÕÕ
might ultimately become ÔÔshipwreckedÕÕ: Forty Years On (1990) 11 Co Law

into existenceÕÕ. Whether that

67 The decision in the Salomon case plainly represents a substantial
obstacle in the way of an argument that the veil of incorporation can be
pierced. Further, the importance of maintaining clarity and simplicity in this
area of law means that, if the doctrine is to exist, the circumstances in which
it can apply must be limited and as clear as possible.

68 Since the decision in the Salomon case, there have been a number of
cases where the courts have considered ÔÔpiercingÕÕ or ÔÔliftingÕÕ the corporate
veil. The most important of those cases are discussed by Lord Sumption JSC
in paras 20—35 above. That discussion demonstrates, as I see it, the
following: (i) the decision of the International Court of Justice in Case
concerning Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Co Ltd (Belgium v Spain)
(Second Phase) [1970] ICJ Rep 3 recognises the doctrine; however, that is in
the context of a civil law system which includes the principle of abuse of
rights, and begs the question whether, in a common law system, the doctrine
should be applicable by the courts in the absence of speciÞc legislative
sanction; (ii) there are judgments in family cases based on obiter dicta in
Nicholas v Nicholas [1984] FLR 285 (e g the judgments of Thorpe LJ in this
case and of Mostyn J in Kremen v Agrest (No 2) [2011] 2 FLR 490), where
the doctrine has been treated as valid and applicable; but the application of
the doctrine, even if it exists, in these cases is unsound, as Munby J
e›ectively (in both senses of the word) indicated in A v A [2007] 2 FLR 467
and Ben Hashem v Al Shayif [2009] 1 FLR 115; (iii) there are two cases
outside the family law context which laid the ground for the establishment
of the doctrine, namely the decisions of the Court of Appeal in Gilford
Motor Co Ltd v Horne [1933] Ch 935, and of Russell J in Jones v Lipman
[1962] 1 WLR 832; (iv) there are two subsequent decisions, one of the
House of Lords, Woolfson v Strathclyde Regional Council 1978 SC (HL) 90,
the other of the Court of Appeal, Adams v Cape Industries plc [1990] Ch
433, in which it was assumed or accepted that the doctrine existed, but they
cannot amount to more than obiter observations, as in neither of them did
the doctrine apply; (v) in subsequent cases in the Court of Appeal and High

Court, it has been (unsurprisingly) assumed that the doctrine does apply, two
recent examples being the Court of Appeal decisions in VTB v Nutritek
[2012] 2 LloydÕs Rep 313 and Alliance Bank JSC v Aquanta Corpn [2013]
1 All ER (Comm) 819; (vi) however, in only two of those subsequent cases
(the Þrst instance decisions in Gencor ACP Ltd v Dalby [2000] 2 BCLC 734
and Trustor AB v Smallbone (No 2) [2001] 1 WLR 1177) has the doctrine
actually been relied on, and they each could have been decided the same way
without recourse to the doctrine, and therefore involved illegitimate
applications of the doctrine on any view: see para 62 above.

69 On closer analysis of cases mentioned in subpara (iii) above, it does
not appear to me that the facts and outcomes in the Gilford Motor and Jones
cases provide much direct support for the doctrine. However, the decisions
can fairly be said to have rested on the doctrine if one takes the language of
the judgments at face value. Further, they indicate that, where a court is of
the view (albeit that I think that it was mistaken in those cases) that there is
no other method of achieving justice, the doctrine provides a valuable means
of doing so.

70 In the Gilford Motor case [1933] Ch 935, the legal argument at Þrst
instance and on appeal seems to have concentrated on the validity of the
restrictive covenant: see pp 936—937, 950—952.
It is also clear from the
judgment of Lord Hanworth MR, at p 961, that counsel for the company
conceded that if, contrary to his contention, the company was a ÔÔmere cloak
or shamÕÕ and that the business was actually being carried on by Horne in
breach of the restrictive covenant, then the company should also be
restrained. Further, in my view, as that passage indicates, the case was one
of concealment, and therefore did not really involve the doctrine at all.

71 In any event, it seems to me that the decision in the Gilford Motor
case that an injunction should be granted against the company was amply
justiÞed on the basis that the company was HorneÕs agent for the purpose of
carrying on the business (just as his wife would have been, if he had used her
as the ÔÔcloakÕÕ); therefore, if an injunction was justiÞed against Horne, it was
justiÞed against the company. There is nothing in the judgments in the
Gilford Motor case to suggest that any member of the Court of Appeal
thought that he was making new law, let alone cutting into the well
established and simple principle laid down in Salomon v A Salomon & Co
Ltd [1897] AC 22.

72 It is by no means inconceivable that the three members of the Court
of Appeal in the Gilford Motor case were using the expression ÔÔcloak or
shamÕÕ to suggest, as a matter of legal analysis, a principal and agent
relationship. Lord Hanworth MR relied on a passage in a judgment of
Lindley LJ in Smith v Hancock [1894] 2 Ch 377, 385 (where the expression
ÔÔcloak or shamÕÕ appears to have originated), and in that passage, it seems to
me that the cloak or sham is treated as amounting to the business being
ÔÔcarried on for the defendantÕÕ. This view is supported by something Lord
Denning MR said in Wallersteiner v Moir [1974] 1 WLR 991, 1013, namely
it was ÔÔquite clearÕÕ that the companies in that case:

ÔÔwere just the puppets of Dr Wallersteiner . . . Transformed into legal
language, they were his agents to do as he commanded. He was the
principal behind them . . . At any rate, it was up to him to show that any
one else had a say in their a›airs and he never did so: cf Gilford.ÕÕ

73 As for Jones v Lipman [1962] 1 WLR 832, I am unconvinced that it
was necessary for Russell J to invoke the doctrine in order to justify an
e›ective order for speciÞc performance, as sought by the plainti›s in that
case. An order for speciÞc performance would have required Lipman not
merely to convey the property in question to the plainti›s, but to do
everything which was reasonably within his power to ensure that the
property was so conveyed: see e g Wroth v Tyler [1974] Ch 30, 47—51.
Lipman and an employee of his solicitors were the sole shareholders and
directors of the company, and its sole liability appears to have been a loan of
£1,500 to a bank (borrowed to meet half the £3,000 which it paid for the
property).
In those circumstances, it seems clear that Lipman could have
compelled the company to convey the property to the plainti›s (on the basis
that he would have to account to the company for the purchase price, which
would have ensured that the bank was in no way prejudiced).
Indeed,
I consider that the company could fairly have been described and treated as
being LipmanÕs ÔÔcreatureÕÕ, without in any way cutting into the principle
established in Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd [1897] AC 22.

74 The history of the doctrine over 80 years of its putative life (taking
the Gilford Motor case [1933] Ch 935 as the starting point) is, therefore, at
least as I see it, a series of decisions, each of which can be put into one of
three categories, namely: (i) decisions in which it was assumed that the
doctrine existed, but it was rightly concluded that it did not apply on the
facts; (ii) decisions in which it was assumed that the doctrine existed, and it
was wrongly concluded that it applied on the facts; and (iii) decisions in
which it was assumed that the doctrine existed and it was applied to the
facts, but where the result could have been arrived at on some other,
conventional, legal basis, and therefore it was wrongly concluded that it
applied: see para 62 above.
(The doctrine has been invoked in cases not
considered by Lord Sumption JSC, but they take matters no further: see the
decisions mentioned and brießy considered in VTB v Nutritek [2013] 2 AC
337, paras 125, 127.)

75 The lack of any coherent principle in the application of the doctrine
has been commented on judicially in many of the major common law

76 Judges in the United States have also been critical, even though the
doctrine has been invoked and developed to a much greater extent than in
this jurisdiction. In Secon Service System Inc v St Joseph Bank and Trust Co
(1988) 855 F 2d 406, 414, Judge Easterbrook in the US Court of Appeals

which for all their vividness tell us nothing about the reasoning which
underpins these decisionsÕÕ. Neyers in ÔÔCanadian Corporate Law, Veil-
(2000) 50 Univ
Piercing, and the Private Law Model CorporationÕÕ
Toronto LJ 173, 180, asks rhetorically: ÔÔHow can the Ôlegal person doctrineÕ
that is so central to corporate law in one sentence be disregarded so casually
in the next?ÕÕ D Michael in ÔÔTo Know a VeilÕÕ (2000) 26 J Corp Law 41, 55,
refers to the doctrine as ÔÔa non-existent and false doctrineÕÕ. Ramsay and
Noakes, ÔÔPiercing the Corporate Veil in AustraliaÕÕ (2001) 19 C & SLJ 250,
251, note that the doctrine ÔÔis far from clear in the case lawÕÕ. Oh, ÔÔVeil-
PiercingÕÕ (2010) 89 Texas Law Review 81, 84 says that ÔÔThe inherent
imprecision in metaphors has resulted in a doctrinal messÕÕ.

78 This last view has some resonance with my remarks in VTB v
Nutritek [2013] 2 AC 337, para 124, about the use of pejorative expressions
to mask the absence of rational analysis.
It also chimes with Cardozo JÕs
reference to the ÔÔmists of metaphorÕÕ in company law, which, ÔÔstarting as
devices to liberate thought, . . . end often by enslaving itÕÕ, in Berkey v Third
Avenue Railway Co (1926) 155 NE 58, 61.

79 In these circumstances, I was initially strongly attracted by the
argument that we should decide that a supposed doctrine, which is
controversial and uncertain, and which, on analysis, appears never to have
been invoked successfully and appropriately in its 80 years of supposed
existence, should be given its quietus. Such a decision would render the law
much clearer than it is now, and in a number of cases it would reduce
complications and costs: whenever the doctrine is really needed, it never
seems to apply.

80 However, I have reached the conclusion that it would be wrong to
discard a doctrine which, while it has been criticised by judges and
academics, has been generally assumed to exist in all common law
jurisdictions, and represents a potentially valuable judicial tool to undo
wrongdoing in some cases, where no other principle is available.
Accordingly, provided that it is possible to discern or identify an approach to

piercing the corporate veil, which accords with normal legal principles,
reßects previous judicial reasoning (so far as it can be discerned and
reconciled), and represents a practical solution (which hopefully will avoid
the problems summarised in para 75 above), I believe that it would be right
to adopt it as a deÞnition of the doctrine.

81 Having read what Lord Sumption JSC says in his judgment,
especially in paras 17, 18, 27, 28, 34 and 35, I am persuaded by his
formulation in para 35, namely that the doctrine should only be invoked
where ÔÔa person is under an existing legal obligation or liability or subject to
an existing legal restriction which he deliberately evades or whose
enforcement he deliberately frustrates by interposing a company under his
controlÕÕ.

82 It appears to me that such a clear and limited doctrine would not fall
foul of at least most of the strictures which have been made of the doctrine.
In particular, (i) it should be of value in the few cases where it can be
properly invoked; (ii) it is, I believe and hope, su–ciently clear as to render it
unlikely to be raised in inappropriate cases; and (iii) it does not cut across the
rule in Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd [1897] AC 22 because it is consistent
with conventional legal principles.

83 It is only right to acknowledge that this limited doctrine may not, on
analysis, be limited to piercing the corporate veil. However, there are three
points to be made about that formulation. In so far as it is based on ÔÔfraud
unravels everythingÕÕ, as discussed by Lord Sumption JSC in para 18, the
formulation simply involves the invocation of a well established principle,
which exists independently of the doctrine. In any event, the formulation is
not, on analysis, a statement about piercing the corporate veil at all. Thus, it
would presumably apply equally to a person who transfers assets to a spouse
or civil partner, rather than to a company. Further, at least in some cases
where it may be relied on, it could probably be analysed as being based on
agency or trusteeship especially in the light of the words ÔÔunder his controlÕÕ.
However, if either or both those points were correct, it would not undermine
Lord Sumption JSCÕs characterisation of the doctrine: it would, if anything,
serve to conÞrm the existence of the doctrine, albeit as an aspect of a more
conventional principle. And if the formulation is intended to go wider than
the application of ÔÔfraud unravels everythingÕÕ, it seems to me questionable
whether it would be right for the court to take the course of arrogating to
itself the right to step in and undo transactions, save where there is a well
established and principled ground for doing so. Such a course is, I would
have thought, at least normally, a matter for the legislature.
Indeed
Parliament has decided to legislate to this e›ect in speciÞed and limited
circumstances with protection for third parties,
in provisions such as
section 37 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 and section 423 of the
Insolvency Act 1986.
BARONESS HALE OF RICHMOND JSC (with whom LORD
WILSON JSC agreed)

84 I agree that this appeal should succeed, on the basis that the
properties in question were held by the respondent companies on trust for
the husband. As he is beneÞcially entitled to them, they fall within the scope
of
to make transfer of property orders under
section 24(1)(a) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. It also means that the

the courtÕs power

[2013] 2 AC

court has power to order that the companies, as bare trustees, transfer these
properties to the wife.

85 The reasons for holding that these properties were beneÞcially
owned by the husband have been amply explained by Lord Sumption JSC.
I would only emphasise the special nature of proceedings for Þnancial relief
and property adjustment under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, which he
explains in para 45. There is a public interest in spouses making proper
provision for one another, both during and after their marriage, in particular
when there are children to be cared for and educated, but also for all the
other reasons explored in cases such as McFarlane v McFarlane [2006] 2 AC
618. This means that the courtÕs role is an inquisitorial one. It also means
that the parties have a duty, not only to one another but also to the court, to
make full and frank disclosure of all the material facts which are relevant to
the exercise of the courtÕs powers, including of course their resources: see
Livesey (formerly Jenkins) v Jenkins [1985] AC 424. If they do not do so, the
court is entitled to draw such inferences as can properly be drawn from all
the available material, including what has been disclosed, judicial experience
of what is likely to be being concealed and the inherent probabilities, in
deciding what the facts are.

86 I also agree, for the reasons given by Lord Sumption JSC, that
section 24(1)(a) does not give the court power to order a spouse to transfer
property to which he is not in law entitled. The words ÔÔentitled, either in
possession or reversionÕÕ refer to a right recognised by the law of property.
This is clear, not only from the statutory language, but also from the
statutory history.

87 The words ÔÔentitled to any property either in possession or reversionÕÕ
Þrst appeared in the Matrimonial Causes Act 1857 (20 & 21 Vict c 85), which
introduced judicial divorce to the law of England and Wales. Section 45 gave
the court power, when granting a decree of divorce on the ground of the wifeÕs
adultery, to settle such property for the beneÞt of the husband and/or the
children of the marriage. The same words were used in section 3 of the
Matrimonial Causes Act 1884 (47 & 48 Vict c 68), when extending the same
power to a husbandÕs application for restitution of conjugal rights. They
were carried through, respectively, into section 191(1)(2) of the Supreme
Court of Judicature (Consolidation) Act 1925, then into section 24(1)(2) of
the Matrimonial Causes Act 1950, then into sections 17(2) and 21(3) of the
Matrimonial Causes Act 1965. The decree of restitution of conjugal rights
was abolished in the comprehensive package of matrimonial law reforms
which came into force on 1 January 1971. That package included, in
section 4(a) of the Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Act 1970, the
power to order either spouse to transfer to the other ÔÔproperty to which the
Þrst-mentioned party is entitled, either in possession or reversionÕÕ. This was
an expansion, for the beneÞt of either spouse and to outright transfer as well
as settlement, of the earlier power to settle the wifeÕs property. Section 4(a)
later became section 24(1)(a) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973.

88 There is nothing in the language, the history, or indeed the report of
the Law Commission which led to the 1970 Act, Report on Financial
Provision in Matrimonial Proceedings (1969) (Law Com No 25), to suggest
that those words should be read to include ÔÔproperty over which the Þrst-
mentioned party has such control that he could cause himself to become
entitled, either in possession or reversionÕÕ. But of course such property can

be taken into account when computing that partyÕs resources for the purpose
of section 25(2) of the 1973 Act, which lays down a non-exhaustive list of
factors to be taken into account by the court when deciding how to exercise
its various powers to make Þnancial and property adjustment orders.

89 Nor is there anything in the language of section 24(1)(a) to suggest
that it was ParliamentÕs intention to grant the divorce courts an express
power to ÔÔpierce the corporate veilÕÕ in such a way as to treat property
belonging to a limited company as property belonging to the spouse who
owns and/or controls the company. The question nevertheless arises as to
whether, in a case such as this, the courts have power to prevent the statutes
under which limited liability companies may be established as separate legal
persons, whether in this or some other jurisdiction, being used as an engine
of fraud. I agree with Lord Sumption JSC that ÔÔpiercing the corporate veilÕÕ
is an example of that general principle, with which family lawyers are
familiar from R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex p Puttick
[1981] QB 767.

90 Lord Sumption JSC refers to the process compendiously as
ÔÔdisregarding the separate personality of the companyÕÕ at para 16. When
considering its scope, however, it may be helpful to consider what the
purpose of doing this is. In Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd [1897] AC 22
the purpose was to go behind the separate legal personality of the company
in order to sue Aron Salomon personally for a liability that was legally that
of the company which he had set up (with himself and members of his family
as shareholders) to conduct his leather and boot-making business. This
succeeded at Þrst instance and in the Court of Appeal (sub nom Broderip v
Salomon), Lindley LJ going so far as to say [1895] 2 Ch 323, 339 that
ÔÔMr Aron SalomonÕs scheme is a device to defraud creditorsÕÕ. They did not
think that Parliament had legislated for the setting up of limited liability
companies in order that sole traders should be able to conduct their
businesses on limited liability terms. But the House of Lords disagreed: the
company was a separate person from Mr Salomon and he could not be made
liable for the companyÕs debts. They did not think that there was any fraud
involved simply in using a limited liability company as a vehicle for
conducting a legitimate business. Thus was the legal structure of modern
business born.

91 But there are a few cases where the courts have apparently been
prepared to disregard the separate personality of a company in order to
grant a remedy, not only against the company, but also against the individual
who owns and/or controls it. Both Gilford Motor Co Ltd v Horne [1933]
Ch 935 and Jones v Lipman [1962] 1 WLR 832 are examples of this. In both
those cases, it so happened that the controller had a pre-existing legal
obligation which he was attempting to evade by setting up a company, in the
one case a contractual obligation not to compete with his former employers,
in the other case a contractual obligation to sell some land to the claimant.
In In re Darby; Ex p Brougham [1911] 1 KB 95, on the other hand, the
liquidator of a creditor company was permitted to go behind the separate
personality of a debtor company registered in Guernsey in order to obtain a
remedy personally against its promoters who had fraudulently creamed o›
the proÞt from the sale by the Guernsey company to the creditor company of
a worthless licence to run a slate quarry in Wales.

92 I am not sure whether it is possible to classify all of the cases in which
the courts have been or should be prepared to disregard the separate legal
personality of a company neatly into cases of either concealment or evasion.
They may simply be examples of the principle that the individuals who
operate limited companies should not be allowed to take unconscionable
advantage of the people with whom they do business. But what the cases do
have in common is that the separate legal personality is being disregarded in
order to obtain a remedy against someone other than the company in respect
of a liability which would otherwise be that of the company alone (if it
existed at all).
In the converse case, where it is sought to convert the
personal liability of the owner or controller into a liability of the company, it
is usually more appropriate to rely on the concepts of agency and of the
ÔÔdirecting mindÕÕ.

93 What we have in this case is a desire to disregard the separate legal
personality of the companies in order to impose on the companies a liability
which can only be that of the husband personally. This is not a liability
under the general law, for example for breach of contract. It is a very speciÞc
statutory power to order one spouse to transfer property to which he is
legally entitled to the other spouse. The argument is that that is a power
which can, because the husband owns and controls these companies, be
exercised against the companies themselves. I Þnd it di–cult to understand
how that can be done unless the company is a mere nominee holding the
property on trust for the husband, as we have found to be the case with the
properties in issue here. I would be surprised if that were not often the case.
94 There is a statutory power to set aside certain dispositions made with
the intention of defeating a claim for Þnancial provision or property
adjustment in section 37 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973.
It is not
suggested in this case that the expenditure involved in buying these
properties, all of which were bought long before the marriage broke down,
was made with that intention.
If it had been, there might have been an
argument that the exception for bona Þde purchasers for value contained in
section 37(4) did not apply to a company where the controlling mind was
acting with that intention. But that is not this case.

95 Stone & Rolls Ltd v Moore Stephens [2009] AC 1391 is an example
of going behind the separate legal personality of the company in order to
ÔÔget atÕÕ the person who owned and controlled it, not for the purpose of
suing him, but in order to attribute his knowledge to the company so that its
auditors could raise a defence of ex turpi causa to the companyÕs allegation
that they had negligently failed to detect the fraudulent nature of its
business.

96 For all

those reasons,

in addition to those given by Lord
Sumption JSC, I would dismiss this appeal on all but the issue of whether
either party had a beneÞcial interest in the properties in question but allow it
on that ground. I fervently hope that the wife will gain some beneÞt from the
outcome of all this litigation, although in the light of the mortgages which
apparently encumber the properties I am not optimistic that she will.

LORD MANCE JSC

97 I agree that the appeal should be allowed for the reasons given by
Lord Sumption JSC, supplemented in their essence by Lord Neuberger of
Abbotsbury PSC.

98 I agree with Lord Sumption JSCÕs analysis of the domestic case law
to date in which the metaphor of ÔÔpiercing the veilÕÕ has been deployed as
part of the reasoning for a decision representing an exception to the basic
principle in Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd [1897] AC 22.

99 In the upshot, the only cases which Lord Sumption JSC identiÞes in
which a principle of ÔÔpiercing the veilÕÕ can be said to have been critical to the
reasoning can be rationalised as falling within what he describes as the
evasion principle. In other cases, the corporate entity was simply being used
to conceal the real actor, or some other analysis or relationship existed (such
as principal and agent, nominee or trustee-beneÞciary) to explain the
decision.

100 It is however often dangerous to seek to foreclose all possible future
situations which may arise and I would not wish to do so. What can be said
with conÞdence is that the strength of the principle in SalomonÕs case and the
number of other tools which the law has available mean that, if there are
other situations in which piercing the veil may be relevant as a Þnal fall-
back, they are likely to be novel and very rare.

101 In this connection, I have however in mind that, in giving the recent
Privy Council judgment in La Gnrale des Carrires et des Mines Sarl v
Hemisphere Associates LLC (Jersey) [2012] 2 LloydÕs Rep 443, para 77,
I said (in a context where Gcamines was a state corporation, not susceptible
of being wound up):

ÔÔThe alternative way in which Hemisphere puts its case is to submit
that, if Gcamines is otherwise accepted as a separate juridical entity, the
facts found justify the lifting of the corporate veil to enable Hemisphere to
pursue Gcamines as well as the state. In the BoardÕs view, this involves a
misapplication of any principles on which the corporate veil may be lifted
under domestic and international
law. Assuming for the sake of
argument that the ÔunceremoniousÕ subjecting of Gcamines to the
controlling will of the state involved a breach by the state of its duty to
respect Gcamines as a separate entity, that might conceivably justify an
a›ected third party, possibly even an aggrieved general creditor of
Gcamines, in suggesting that the corporate veil should be lifted to make
the state, which had deprived Gcamines of assets, liable for GcaminesÕ
debts. The Board need express no further view on that possibility.
It
represents the inverse of the present situation. There is no basis for
treating the stateÕs taking or GcaminesÕ use of GcaminesÕ assets for state
purposes, at which Hemisphere directs vigorous criticism, as a
justiÞcation for imposing on Gcamines yet further and far larger burdens
in the form of responsibility for the whole of the debts of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo. In international law as in domestic law, lifting the
corporate veil must be a tailored remedy, Þtted to the circumstances
giving rise [to] it.ÕÕ
102 It may be that the possibility on which I touched in para 77 would
evaporate as a possible further exception to the principle in SalomonÕs case
[1897] AC 22.
It is certainly a di›erent situation to those which Lord
Sumption JSC discusses. But one would wish to hear further argument on
this or any other suggested exception, in a case where it was directly
relevant, before deciding this. No one should, however, be encouraged to
think that any further exception, in addition to the evasion principle, will be

easy to establish, if any exists at all. The evident absence, under the close
scrutiny to which Lord Sumption JSC has subjected the case law, of
authority for any further exception speaks for itself.

LORD CLARKE OF STONE-CUM-EBONY JSC

103 I agree with the other members of the court that the appeal should
be allowed for the reasons given by Lord Sumption JSC. I only wish to add a
word on piercing the corporate veil. I agree that there is such a doctrine and
I also agree that Munby J was correct in Ben
that its limits are not clear.
Hashem v Al Shayif [2009] 1 FLR 115 to suggest that the court only has
power to pierce the corporate veil when all other more conventional
remedies have proved to be of no assistance. It is thus likely to be deployed
in a very rare case. Lord Sumption JSC may be right to say that it will only
be done in a case of evasion, as opposed to concealment, where it is not
necessary. However, this was not a distinction that was discussed in the
course of the argument and, to my mind, should not be deÞnitively adopted
unless and until the court has heard detailed submissions on it. I agree with
Lord Mance JSC that it is often dangerous to seek to foreclose all possible
future situations which may arise and, like him, I would not wish to do so.
I expressed a similar view in VTB Capital plc v Nutritek International Corpn
[2013] 2 AC 337 and adhere to it now. However, I also agree with Lord
Mance JSC and others that the situations in which piercing the corporate veil
may be available as a fall-back are likely to be very rare and that no one
should be encouraged to think that any further exception, in addition to the
evasion principle, will be easy to establish. It will not.

LORD WALKER OF GESTINGTHORPE

104 Lord Sumption JSC has comprehensively analysed the rather
confused evidence relating to beneÞcial ownership of the London properties.
His conclusion that they are all in the beneÞcial ownership of Mr Prest is in
my view irresistible, based as it is on positive evidence of the sources from
which the purchases were funded, as well as on inferences drawn from the
failure of Mr Murphy, a director of PRL, to attend court for cross-
examination. I also agree with all Lord Sumption JSCÕs observations as to
the construction and e›ect of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, to which
Baroness Hale of Richmond JSC has added a full account of its legislative
history. The appeal should be allowed in the terms proposed by Lord
Sumption JSC.

105 In these circumstances it is not strictly necessary for this court to
add further general comments on the vexed question of piercing the
corporate veil. But for my part I think it would be a lost opportunityÑeven
perhaps a minor dereliction of dutyÑif we were to abstain from any further
comment.
I do therefore welcome the full discussion in the judgments of
Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury PSC, Baroness Hale, Lord Mance and Lord
Sumption JJSC.

106 I am reluctant to add to the discussion but for my part I consider
that ÔÔpiercing the corporate veilÕÕ is not a doctrine at all, in the sense of a
coherent principle or rule of law.
It is simply a labelÑoften, as Lord
Sumption JSC observes, used indiscriminatelyÑto describe the disparate
occasions on which some rule of law produces apparent exceptions to the
principle of the separate juristic personality of a body corporate rea–rmed

These may result from a statutory provision, or from joint liability in tort, or
from the law of unjust enrichment, or from principles of equity and the law
of trusts (but without any ÔÔfalse invocation of equityÕÕ in the phrase used by
C Mitchell in the article mentioned by Lord Neuberger PSC, at para 77).
They may result simply from the potency of an injunction or other court
order in binding third parties who are aware of its terms. If there is a small
residual category in which the metaphor operates independently no clear
example has yet been identiÞed, but Stone & Rolls Ltd v Moore Stephens
[2009] AC 1391, mentioned in Baroness Hale JSCÕs judgment, is arguably an
example.
