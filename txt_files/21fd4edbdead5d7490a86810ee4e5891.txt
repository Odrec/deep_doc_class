Base Rate Fallacy

A cab was involved in a hit and run accident at night. Two
cab companies, the Green and the Blue, operate in the city.
You are given the following data:

(cid:73) 85% of the cabs in the city are Green and 15% are Blue
(cid:73) a witness identiﬁed the cab as Blue.

The court tested the reliability of the witness under the same
circumstances that existed on the night of the accident and
concluded that the witness correctly identiﬁed each one of the
two colors 80% of the time and failed 20% of the time. What
is the probability that the cab involved in the accident was
Blue rather than Green?
