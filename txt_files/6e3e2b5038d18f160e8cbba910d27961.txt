General	Course	Outline	

According	to	Terry	Eagleton,	we	now	live	in	an	age	"after	Theory",	in	that	the	so-called	golden	
age	of	literary	and	cultural	theory	has	receded	into	the	past,	but	its	insights,	and	above	all,	its	
questions	still	shape	the	intellectual	contours	of	our	present.	In	this	course	we	will	read	and	
discuss	texts	that	articulate	or	address	some	of	the	major	developments	in	modern	Anglo-
American	literary	and	cultural	theory.	We	will	approach	this	diverse	field	of	enquiry	by	exploring	
some	of	the	prominent	debates	regarding	the	place	of	literature	in	our	midst	and	how	we	
approach	it.	In	the	process,	we	will	attempt	to	take	stock	of	some	of	the	theoretical	positions	
advanced	by	cultural	studies,	Marxism,	gender	studies,	postcolonial	studies,	and	New	Historicism.	
In	order	to	take	and	enjoy	this	class,	you	should	be	willing	to	read,	analyze,	and	discuss	theoretical	
and	critical	texts.	The	required	readings	will	be	made	available	online	on	Stud.IP	before	our	first	
class.	Please	check	Stud.IP	regularly	for	updates,	announcements,	and	changes.	
General	requirements:	
1.	Regular	attendance	and	active	participation	in	classroom	discussions	and	group	work.	
2.	Please	note	that	all	course	participants	will	need	to	read	each	of	the	texts	being	discussed	in	
the	class	carefully	and	prepare	their	notes	or	answers	diligently	in	terms	of	the	relevant	
questions.	
Requirements	for	grade:	All	of	the	above,	and	a	seminar	paper	(approx.	6000	words).	
Please	note	that	the	following	schedule	is	subject	to	change.	Please	consult	the	Stud.IP	course	
pages	regularly	for	updates.
