Divergence of fMRI and neural signals in V1 during
perceptual suppression in the awake monkey

The role of primary visual cortex (V1) in determining the contents of perception is controversial. Human functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of perceptual suppression have revealed a robust drop in V1 activity when a stimulus is
subjectively invisible. In contrast, monkey single-unit recordings have failed to demonstrate such perception-locked changes in
V1. To investigate the basis of this discrepancy, we measured both the blood oxygen level–dependent (BOLD) response and
several electrophysiological signals in two behaving monkeys. We found that all signals were in good agreement during
conventional stimulus presentation, showing strong visual modulation to presentation and removal of a stimulus. During
perceptual suppression, however, only the BOLD response and the low-frequency local ﬁeld potential (LFP) power showed
decreases, whereas the spiking and high-frequency LFP power were unaffected. These results demonstrate that the coupling
between the BOLD and electrophysiological signals in V1 is context dependent, with a marked dissociation occurring during
perceptual suppression.

Perceptual suppression provides an intriguing puzzle for sensory
neuroscientists: how is an unperceived stimulus represented in the
brain? Binocular rivalry and related phenomena, in which salient visual
patterns are rendered temporarily invisible to the observer, have been
frequently employed to dissociate sensation from perception while
monitoring brain activity1. These studies have provided insight into
the nature of visual suppression, but have nonetheless failed to answer
the fundamental question of what role V1 activity has in determining
the visibility of a stimulus2. The main problem is that human and
animal studies have reached nearly opposite conclusions. On the one
hand, measurements of the BOLD signal
in human fMRI have
commonly found partial or even complete elimination of V1 responses
to perceptually suppressed stimuli during rivalry3–9, which suggests that
V1 is important in determining whether a stimulus reaches subsequent
processing stages. On the other hand, monkey single-unit studies found
little or no change in activity in this area as a function of perceptual
state, leading to the conclusion that perceptual suppression does not
involve the perturbation of visual signals in the ﬁrst cortical processing
stage10–13. This discrepancy has been identiﬁed as a major impediment
for understanding how V1 activity contributes to perception.

Until now, it has been impossible to isolate the potential reasons for
the observed differences, as fMRI and electrophysiological studies
have differed in their visual stimuli, behavioral procedures and
species tested3,14,15. Here, we directly investigated the basis of these
contradictory ﬁndings and further explored the role of V1 in
visual perception by measuring both fMRI and electrophysiological
responses of two trained monkeys experiencing perceptual suppression.
Holding the stimulus procedure constant, we found that fMRI and

neurophysiological signals in V1, although in good agreement during
conventional stimulation, consistently diverged during perceptual
suppression, with the most accurate reﬂection of stimulus visibility
provided by BOLD responses.

RESULTS
The main objective of the study was to compare neural and fMRI
responses under identical stimulus and perceptual conditions. To this
end, we trained both monkeys to respond explicitly to the visibility of a
salient target that was presented on a screen by depressing a lever when-
ever the target was present. We used generalized ﬂash suppression
(GFS)16, where a salient target disappears on the abrupt onset of a
surrounding ﬁeld of dynamic dots, to reliably induce perceptual
suppression (the stimulus sequence used in the present study is
shown in Fig. 1a). Previous work in monkeys13 and humans16
demonstrated that such a stimulus reliably leads to all-or-none percep-
tual suppression in the absence of either local or interocular conﬂict. By
adjusting stimulus parameters, such as the density of the dots, the
minimum distance between the dots and the target, and the ocular
conﬁguration, we were able to affect the probability of the all-or-none
target disappearance (see Methods). Suppression in the GFS procedure
is related to that in motion-induced blindness17, but is controlled using
a temporal sequence resembling binocular rivalry ﬂash suppression18.
As with conventional binocular rivalry, GFS suppression is known to
diminish the visual responses of extrastriate cortical neurons, but has
little effect on V1 ﬁring rates10,11,19,20.

We used two general approaches to induce perceptual suppression.
In the ﬁrst, which we term perceptual report testing, we adjusted the

Figure 1 Generalized ﬂash suppression protocol for the block design
experiment. (a) Stimulus conditions. The parameters of the salient target and
the random dot surround were adjusted to create ﬁve different conditions,
with individual trials lasting 6 s (1-min blocks consisted of up to nine such
trials). In the generalized ﬂash suppression (INV) condition, the appearance
of surrounding dots to both eyes consistently induced the monocular target to
disappear (the time period during which the target stimulus disappears is
indicated with a thick orange line). In the physical removal (OFF) condition,
the target was physically extinguished on appearance of the dots, mimicking
perceptual suppression. In the temporal reversal (VISTR) and binocular (VIS)
conditions, the stimuli were adjusted by reversing the order of the target (red
disk) and surround (moving random dots) or by presenting the target to both
eyes, respectively, to ensure that the target did not disappear. Finally, in the
ﬁxation (FIX) condition (not depicted), the screen remained blank as the
monkey ﬁxated a small cross throughout the trial. (T on ¼ target on, T off ¼
target off, S on ¼ surround on, S off ¼ surround off). (b) The two modes of
block design used for the fMRI experiments. In the sequential block design,
the ﬁve stimulus conditions alternated in a ﬁxed temporal order, keeping the
number of stimulus conditions per run constant. In the randomized block
design, each condition was presented in pseudorandomized order, each
preceded by a blank screen ﬁxation condition. (c) Psychophysical responses during the different conditions. The probabilities of perceptual suppression that
are shown were based on ten psychophysical test sessions (ﬁve from each animal) and are plotted as the mean and s.e.m. over these sessions.

stimulus parameters at the beginning of each session according to
the monkeys’ psychophysical report such that the probability of
disappearance for each trial presentation was roughly 0.5. This method,
which was applied in a previous study13, entails the sorting of neural
responses by the monkey’s report on a trial-by-trial basis. The second
approach, which allowed direct comparison of fMRI and electrophy-
siological responses, was termed block design testing (Fig. 1b). In block
design testing, which was used for the majority of the study, the
visibility of the target was controlled over extended periods (blocks)
by biasing the physical stimulus parameters (see Methods).

To isolate signal changes related to perceptual suppression, we
compared responses during conditions in which the target was ren-
dered either visible (VIS) or invisible (INV). Because of the existing
discrepancy in the literature, we were particularly interested in whether
activity during suppression (INV) would fall to the level of a control
condition in which the stimulus condition was turned off when
the surrounding dots appeared (OFF). This control condition is
perceptually indistinguishable from suppres-
sion16. For both fMRI and electrophysiologi-
cal testing, brain activation was measured
relative to a stimulus-free ﬁxation condition
(FIX). Note that
the monkeys were not
required to conﬁrm the disappearance during
the block design testing (maintaining accurate

perceptual report for truly ambiguous stimuli requires a large propor-
tion of interspersed catch trials). Nonetheless, the effectiveness of the
biased stimulus conﬁgurations was evaluated repeatedly in perceptual
report testing. The behavioral results in the two animals verify that the
manipulations of stimulus visibility were highly effective (see Fig. 1c)
and matched the expectations of observed psychophysical results in a
different group of monkeys13.

In the block design, stimuli were grouped into 30- or 60-s epochs of
repeated 6-s trials, during which the monkey was required to ﬁxate a
small cross. Blocks of the different conditions (INV, VIS, OFF, etc.)
were presented either sequentially or in randomly interleaved order
(Fig. 1b), with a total of four blocks of each type per scanning session.
After successfully completed trials, the animal received a drop of apple
juice and a short break (0.8–1.0s) in which it was free to brieﬂy move its
eyes about. Two animals participated in a total of 29 fMRI sessions and
41 electrophysiology sessions, which were conducted over the same
time period, but on different days.
