[...] We do this type of interviewing all  the time / because we think you can only learn 
general features of a certain culture - of a certain people - if you do do it in 
concentrating on unique cases \ you know \ you  have to start with unique cases - then 
you have to compare it and so it would be a real gift to us / if you could tell us as far as 
it poss as it is possible in a in a short time your life history / take in a account a little 
bit the special situation of being in in Wales / [...] we did not think it would be 
possible to to interview one of our teachers / we thought it might not be appropriate / 
but I think it is so interesting what you told us - so I dared to ask you \ when we have 
done the interview and we would look at it / you would get a copy and you can think if 
something is in it which you would not wouldn’t have liked to tell #us / then you can 
#probably most of it will be yes 
you tell us / you tell us and if we would use it for publication we would ask you what 
to use and what not and we would mask of course if it is especially on Nant Gwrtheyrn 
/ it will be difficult and we’ll have to talk about it \ but you can be sure I do this type of 
interviewing interviews for twenty years or so and I never did any harm to anybody \ 
that’s alright then #it’s always 
then you can be 
the first time always in there \ always the #first time \ (laughing) 
#yeah (laughing) okay then just please you know we if you tell us your life history / we 
would not interrupt you \ we would try to be good listeners - only if we cannot follow 
the line of your storytelling we would step in \ but we jot down a few notes / and later 
on / if we would have the time we would ask you about it \ but we would not like to 
cut your red thread because then it would be #spoiled \ 
#yes \ 
so be not concerned that we keep our mouth shut \ 
that’s alright you can you can it might be a lot easier if you would suit me maybe ask 
me a few questions on the way anyway \ 
yeah \ sure \ yeah \ so may would be nice if you just think back and you have to decide 
when your life history started / if it would be with something which you apparently did 
/ that you give (laughing) that you got be conceived? you know / #(laughing) 
#yes hopefully that happened (laughing) yes \ 
yeah all the your first remembrances everybody does it differently \ (laughing) 
yeah \ so right then \ well I was eh I was born eh back in 1963 / so if you were all here 
you can all send me a birthday card next month / 5th of october to make (...) if you 
want to / so I was born in a small local hospital in just outside seven miles away \ um 
I’ve got two brothers / eh one is twentyeight / the other one is twenty six / both of them 
are married / I’m I’m still looking for a wife / so if you have got any ideas on that line / 
it will be very much appreciated - it could help me a lot in this / (laughing) I was I was 
born in Glenberrel / and eh I was raised in a Welsh family / Welsh background / em 
that’s it exept for my grandmother \ eh my grandmother was Irish \ em and I had 
usually spoke English / to a certain extent with her \ but the first eleven years of my 
life / (0.580) em (2.348) as far as eh my lang the language was concerned / I did 
everything eh through the medium of Welsh \ and I didn’t know any anything else / 
exept for Welsh \ did hear a little bit of of English - and so on - but the early years it 
was certainly Welsh \ and I think but Welsh \ all my friends em and all my family / 
who lived in the area / all spoke Welsh \ so that was the natural language that was the 
only language that I knew for many many years \ #eh

as I said my grandmother was eh Irish / eh she spoke a little bit of Welsh and a little bit 
of English eh a lot of English but eh I always used to eh speak Welsh to her \ #she 
would answer  
#mhm 
to me back in in English \ 
mhm #mhm 
#but she understood everything I think she was embarrassed that her Welsh wasn’t all 
that good / but she understood everything \ em I did em the weekends when I was 
young / young a young lad I used to go up to stay with my parents grandparents / em to 
a place called Nant Gwinernth / which is just in the foots of Snowdon \ 
mhm 
and everybody in that nant village as well spoke Welsh \ so it my first years I was 
surrounded by Welsh and Welsh Welsh only really \ 
mhm 
as I grew older / maybe when I was around nine - and ten or eleven years old - em I 
stur started taking notice of you know the English language because it was eh it was 
used mainly during the summer months back in the village \ em that was when visitors 
to the area came / and they spoke eh obviously they spoke English \ so we did hear a 
little bit of English although we didn’t understand \ all of it \ I went to the local school 
in Aven / local primary school / em em I was there for seven years \ and during my 
time there em I think out of about a hundred children in the school only four or five 
were actually English at that time \ so on scan? when I was at school everything was 
done through the medium of Welsh \ 
eh when I was eleven I went to the secondary school at Mchelly / em and there em it 
was a bit of a shock because there we had to do all our subjects through the medium of 
English \ which was to a certain extent in the first few years it was very very unfair - 
personal view it was very very unfair \ em and people always used to tell us when we 
were young - eh you can never go on in the world - with just the Welsh language 
because you won’t be able to go further than maybe Bangor \ which is thirty Miles 
away \ if you grow old - look for work - you’ll have to go \ out of the area to look for 
work and definitely you’ll have to have English \ em the first two years in the 
secondary school / we did as much work in French as we did in in Welsh \ we only had 
the one Welsh lesson \ that was the only time we did any work through the medium of 
Welsh \ we also had the same time with French \ and I told you that that was a 
complete waste of time \ em so we did all our subjects through the medium of of eh of 
English which was eh very very hard in the first first few years \ once we went to the 
(clears his throat) to the eh I think with eh thirteen fourteen we went to another school 
in Mchelly / em and there was there was a lot more English coming into the school \ a 
lot more English families moving into the area \ em and it was very - how can I say \ it 
was very very it was a sad time because eh a lot of my friends started to speak a lot 
more English \ em there were a lot more English students coming into the school - em 
a lot more English families moving into the area - and generally the Welsh language 
was being maybe pushed to one side / em the English language was certainly taking 
over \ and eh it was it was hard I think \ because people were kind of doing away with 
the Welsh language \ em lots lots of people believed that the Welsh language was 
dying \ and that in a few years time you know the Welsh would be like Latin \ it would 
be dead \ kind of thing \ lots of people talked like that in especially in the seventies \ 
em but I had the chance when I was in the sixth year to eh do my A levels / and go go 
on to University \ but I decided to eh drop out when I was: in the first year \ in the sixth 
sixth year \ I decided to drop out and look for work I thought working would bring out
