SUMMARY

Axis formation is one of the earliest patterning events
in plant and animal embryogenesis. In Arabidopsis,
the main axis of the embryo is evident at the asym-
metric division of the zygote into a small, embryonic
apical cell and a large extraembryonic basal cell.
Here we show that the homeobox genes WOX2 and
WOX8, which are initially coexpressed in the zygote,
act as complementary cell fate regulators in the apical
and basal lineage, respectively. Furthermore, WOX8
expression in the basal cell lineage is required for
WOX2 expression and normal development of the
proembryo, suggesting an inductive mechanism.
The identiﬁed WOX cascade is required for normal ex-
pression of a reporter gene of the auxin efﬂux carrier
PIN1 and for the formation of auxin response maxima
in the proembryo. Thus, our results link the spatial
separation of WOX transcription factors to localized
auxin response and the formation of the main body
axis in the embryo.

INTRODUCTION

Development of a speciﬁc body plan during embryogenesis re-
quires the coordination of cell fates according to their positions
along the embryo axes. In animal model organisms, the accessi-
bility of egg cells has greatly enhanced analysis of early pattern-
ing. In higher plants, however, the zygote is relatively inaccessible
to experimental analysis due to the surrounding maternal tissue,
and the high degree of genetic redundancy has complicated
analysis of regulatory mechanisms. An invariant cell division
pattern during early embryogenesis in Arabidopsis facilitates
the following of the apical and basal lineages derived from each
daughter cell (Figure 1A; Dolan et al., 1993; Mansﬁeld and Briarty,
1991). First, the zygote divides asymmetrically and generates
two daughter cells with different properties and developmental
programs. The small and densely cytoplasmic apical daughter
divides perpendicular to the orientation of the division of the zy-
gote, and subsequent divisions generate the isodiametric cells
of the apical cell lineage, termed proembryo. At the 8-cell stage,
the proembryo is already divided into an upper tier of cells giving

rise to the shoot and a lower tier of cells giving rise to the hypo-
cotyl and embryonic root. Subsequent tangential cell walls estab-
lish the radial axis, separating protoderm and inner cells before
shoot meristem, cotyledon, hypocotyl, and embryonic root pri-
mordia are formed. By contrast, the larger and more vacuolated
basal daughter cell of the zygote continues to divide horizontally,
producing a ﬁle of elongated cells, termed the suspensor, which
pushes the embryo into the lumen of the developing seed
(Ju¨ rgens and Mayer, 1994; Mansﬁeld and Briarty, 1991). Only
the uppermost cell of the basal lineage, the hypophysis, becomes
incorporated into the embryo where it gives rise to the quiescent
center and the columella stem cells of the root meristem (for
review see Jenik et al., 2007; Ju¨ rgens, 2001; Laux et al., 2004).
Similar to animals with invariant cell division patterns, speciﬁca-
tion of cell
identities in the Arabidopsis embryo relies on
cell-cell communication.

Recent studies have revealed a crucial role for the directional
transport of the plant growth factor auxin in apical-basal axis for-
mation. After the asymmetric division of the zygote, the auxin ef-
ﬂux factor PIN-FORMED7 (PIN7) is expressed only in the basal
daughter cell and becomes localized to the membrane facing
the apical daughter (Friml et al., 2003). Presumably, auxin is
transported into the apical daughter cell where it accumulates,
as evidenced by weak expression of the synthetic auxin re-
sponse reporter gene DR5rev:GFP. Auxin ﬂux is then thought
to be reversed in the globular stage embryo, involving the com-
bined activity of several PIN proteins, which results in the forma-
tion of an auxin response maximum at the developing root pole.
Later in embryogenesis, additional auxin response maxima are
formed at the tips of the emerging cotyledons mediated by polar
cellular localization of PIN1 protein, which is thought to play an
important role in auxin ﬂux from the globular embryo stage on-
ward (Benkova et al., 2003). Loss of multiple members of the
PIN family; mutations in the Auxin Response Factor (ARF)
GTPase exchange factor GNOM (GN), which is required for di-
rectional trafﬁcking of PIN1 protein; and chemical inhibition of
polar auxin transport all cause striking defects in apical-basal
embryo patterning, demonstrating the crucial role of polar auxin
distribution in axis formation (Blilou et al., 2005; Friml et al., 2003;
Geldner et al., 2003; Mayer et al., 1993; Steinmann et al., 1999).
Similarly, embryos that have lost the ARF MONOPTEROS (MP)
or harbor auxin nondegradable variants of its antagonist BOD-
ENLOS (BDL) fail to initiate the hypophysis, indicating that tran-
scriptional responses to auxin are required for root initiation

(Berleth and Ju¨ rgens, 1993; Hamann et al., 1999, 2002). At the
same time, MP activity is also required for the expression of
PIN genes, consistent with a feedback mechanism wherein
high auxin concentration promotes increased directional auxin
efﬂux (Paciorek et al., 2005; Weijers et al., 2006).

A fundamental question is how the differences between apical
and basal programs are established. Mutations in the MAPKK ki-
nase YODA (YDA) suppress the elongation of the zygote and de-
velopment of the extraembryonic suspensor, suggesting that
a MAP kinase signaling pathway promotes extraembryonic fate
in the basal lineage (Lukowitz et al., 2004). However, the targets
of presumed YDA signaling remain to be determined. In animals,
localized expression of transcription factors is instrumental for
early cell fate decisions in the embryo (Akam, 1998; Krumlauf,
1994). For example, homeobox (HOX) genes confer region-spe-
ciﬁc identities along the anterior-posterior axis in Drosophila and
mammals. Recent studies in Arabidopsis have identiﬁed a group

of homeobox genes related to the stem cell regulator WUSCHEL
(WUS) that are expressed in a lineage-speciﬁc manner during
early embryogenesis (Figures 1A and 1B; Haecker et al., 2004).
WUSCHEL RELATED HOMEOBOX2 (WOX2) and WOX8 are
initially coexpressed in the egg cell and the zygote, but become
restricted to the apical (WOX2) and basal (WOX8) lineages after
the zygotic division, raising the intriguing question of whether
distinct transcriptional programs are established with the divi-
sion of the zygote. WOX9, the closest homolog of WOX8, is
also expressed in the basal cell lineage, and several members
of the WUS/WOX2 subclade become expressed in the develop-
ing proembryo (Figure 1B; Haecker et al., 2004). Once the apical-
basal axis of the embryo is established, expression of two WOX
genes, WUS and WOX5, is initiated in lineages that give rise to
the signaling centers of the shoot and root stem cell niches, re-
spectively (Mayer et al., 1998; Sarkar et al., 2007). Apart from
Arabidopsis, complementary expression of WOX2 and WOX9

seedling stage, instead of two as in wild-type (Figures 1H, 1M,
and 1N).

We investigated whether the low penetrance of the wox2-1
phenotype might be due to genetic redundancy. Embryo devel-
opment in single mutants of the close WOX2 homologs WOX1
and PRESSED FLOWER/WOX3 (PRS; Matsumoto and Okada,
2001) was normal, and the wox2 phenotype was not signiﬁcantly
affected by combining either mutation with wox2-1 (Table S1).
By contrast, wox1 wox2-1 prs triple mutants displayed a strong
increase in the frequency of wox2 defects (Figure 1O), indicating
that WOX1 and PRS act redundantly with WOX2 in shoot
patterning.

WOX5 belongs to the same subclade of the WOX gene family
as WOX1, WOX2, and PRS (Figure 1B; Haecker et al., 2004). In
addition to its expression in the developing root stem cell niche,
WOX5 is expressed in the vasculature of the cotyledon primordia
from heart stage onward (Haecker et al., 2004). While wox5-1
single mutants showed normal shoot development (Table S1),
the wox5-1 mutation strongly enhanced shoot patterning defects
of wox1 wox2-1 prs triple mutants (Figure 1O), resulting in qua-
druple mutant seedlings with a rod-like apical outgrowth (30%,
n = 495; Figure 1I) or an apparent complete lack of all shoot
structures (18%; Figure 1J). Importantly, wox1 wox5-1 prs triple
mutant shoots were normal (Figure 1O) and wox5-1 alone did not
signiﬁcantly enhance the wox2 phenotype (Table S1). Therefore,
WOX2 appears to be the main regulator of embryonic shoot pat-
terning among the WOX genes analyzed, whereas WOX1, PRS,
and WOX5 activity only becomes relevant in the absence of
WOX2 function.

WOX8 and WOX9 Genes Redundantly Affect Basal
and Apical Lineage Development
Next we addressed the function of the basally expressed WOX8
and WOX9 genes (Haecker et al., 2004). Several independent
wox8 and wox9 single mutants representing severe or complete
loss of function, based on mRNA expression analysis (Figure S1),
did not visibly affect embryo development (Table S2). This is
unlike the recently reported embryo lethality in stip/wox9 alleles
(Wu et al., 2007), which might be due to differences in growth
conditions, genetic background, or both. Postembryonically,
wox9 mutants displayed disturbed ovule development (data
not shown).

In contrast to single mutants, all wox8 wox9 double mutant
combinations analyzed displayed strong deviations from wild-
type embryogenesis, which in the following will be discussed
for wox8-1 wox9-1 (Figure 2; Table S2). Initially, segregating
wox8-1 wox9-1/+ embryos were morphologically indistinguish-
able from wild-type at the zygote (n = 98) and the 1-cell embryo
stages (n = 192). Subsequently, however, the apical cell divided
horizontally instead of vertically in approximately half of the ex-
pected homozygous double mutants, consistent with previous
reports (Wu et al., 2007). In addition, a minority of segregating
embryos displayed irregular cell division planes or enlarged, mis-
shapen cells in the basal lineage (Figure 2H; Table S2). From the
8-cell stage on (throughout the text, mutant stages will be deﬁned
according to the stages of their phenotypically normal siblings in
the same silique), approximately one-fourth of the segregating
embryos had large, vacuolized cells throughout and developed
into ﬁnger-like structures (Figures 2I and 2J) that eventually

homologous genes has recently also been detected in maize
embryos, suggesting that WOX genes might play a conserved
role in angiosperm embryogenesis (Nardmann and Werr, 2006).
Here, we address the role of WOX gene function in early em-
bryo patterning. We demonstrate that WOX2 and WOX8 identify
two subclades of developmental regulators that mediate distinct
cell fates after the asymmetric zygotic division. In addition to
WOX8/WOX9 function in the basal lineage, WOX2 expression
in the proembryo is dependent on WOX8/WOX9, revealing an
interaction across clonal boundaries. Importantly, the establish-
ment of asymmetric WOX transcriptional domains is linked to the
formation of auxin gradients during embryogenesis.

RESULTS

WOX2 Acts Redundantly with Other WOX Genes
in Apical Embryo Patterning
Consistent with the accumulation of WOX2 transcripts in the api-
cal cell and the early proembryo (Figure 1A; Haecker et al., 2004),
approximately one-third of all 8-cell embryos with the putative
null allele wox2-1 (Figure S1, see the Supplemental Data avail-
able with this article online) failed to correctly separate the
protoderm layer by periclinal divisions in one or more cells of
the prospective shoot region (Figures 1D and 1E; Table S1). Sub-
sequently, 8% of mutant embryos (n = 191) initiated only one
cotyledon primordia (Figure 1F), which was either normal or rep-
resented a fusion of two apparently misplaced organs at the

arrested development. Thus, neither the suspensor nor the pro-
embryo developed normally in wox8 wox9 double mutants. All
defects were completely rescued by transformation with geno-
mic or cDNA clones for either WOX8 or WOX9 (data not shown).
To characterize the development of wox8-1 wox9-1 double
mutants at the molecular level, we generated several cell fate
markers for the early embryo (see Experimental Procedures).
For all reporter genes assayed, phenotypically normal siblings
displayed wild-type expression, suggesting that maternal or
dominant zygotic effects did not play a relevant role. A number
of marker genes, including AtML1, WOX9, and histone H4,
were expressed normally in wox8-1 wox9-1 until at least the
globular stage (Figure S2), indicating that the double mutant
embryos, albeit morphologically severely affected, are able to
execute relevant gene expression programs to some extent.

Expression of WOX8gD:NLS-venusYFP3 (vYFP3) as a reporter
gene for the basal lineage was initially indistinguishable from that
of wild-type, but became conﬁned to only one or two of the most
basal suspensor cells in double mutant embryos after the 8-cell
embryo stage (Figures 3A and 3B; Table S3). Expression of
a WOX5:NLS-vYFP3 reporter, which marks the development of
the quiescent center in the root stem cell niche, was undetect-
able or strongly reduced in wox8-1 wox9-1 embryos (Figure 3D;
Table S4), indicating that the hypophyseal region was not cor-
rectly speciﬁed. Thus, gene expression programs of the basal
lineage are not properly established in wox8 wox9 double
mutants.

The aberrant proembryo development in wox8-1 wox9-1 sug-
gested that WOX8/WOX9, in addition to their function in the
basal lineage, exert a non-cell-autonomous effect on the apical
lineage. In support of this view, the wox8-1 mutation enhanced
the shoot patterning defects of wox2-1 and wox1 wox2-1 prs
embryos, resulting in rod-like seedlings without any discernable
shoot structures in the most extreme cases (Figure 1K and 1O;
Table S1).

To determine whether gene expression programs in the apical
lineage were altered in wox8-1 wox9-1 mutants, we ﬁrst ana-
lyzed expression of a ZWILLE-YFP (ZLL:ZLL-YFP; M. Tucker
and T.L., unpublished data) reporter gene, which normally marks
all cells of the early globular proembryo before becoming re-
stricted to the vascular primordium (Figure 3E). ZLL-YFP signal
was not detectable in wox8-1 wox9-1 embryos (Figure 3F; Table
S5). To investigate earlier stages of embryogenesis, we used
a WOX2:NLS-YFP reporter construct containing 3 kb of the
WOX2 promoter sequence. This fragment provided YFP expres-
sion in proembryo and suspensor cells, unlike the endogenous
WOX2 mRNA, presumably due to the lack of negative cis-
elements that restrict the activity of the endogenous WOX2
promoter to the proembryo. The very strong expression of this
construct, however, made it possible to reliably detect signals
from the 1-cell stage in whole-mount immature seeds (Fig-
ure 3G). Compared with wild-type, approximately one-fourth of
segregating wox8-1 wox9-1/+ embryos lacked any detectable
WOX2:NLS-YFP expression from the 1-cell embryo stage
onward (Figure 3H; Table S6), indicating that wox8-1 wox9-1
double mutants fail to express this reporter gene also in the
1-cell proembryo.

In summary, WOX8 and WOX9 are essential for the normal ex-
ecution of gene expression programs and normal development

and Localized Auxin Response in the Proembryo
To investigate whether auxin distribution was affected in wox8-1
wox9-1 embryos, we monitored expression of the DR5rev:GFP

conditions, DR5rev:GFP expression was detected in the hypo-
physeal cell of wild-type embryos from early globular stages
on (Figure 3I), and in the tips of the cotyledon primordia at heart
stage (inset of Figure 4N). In contrast to this polar distribution,
wox8-1 wox9-1 double mutants showed DR5rev:GFP signal uni-
formly throughout the embryo (n = 35; Figure 3J), as previously
reported (Wu et al., 2007). Since this uniform auxin response
was not changed after chemical interference with auxin transport
by naphthylphthalamic acid and brefeldin A (data not shown), we
investigated the expression of the PIN1:PIN1-GFP reporter gene
(Benkova et al., 2003). PIN1:PIN1-GFP signal was detected at
newly formed cell walls in globular wild-type embryos
(Figure 3K). By contrast, PIN1:PIN1-GFP expression was re-
duced in segregating embryos and not detectable in the majority
of dissected wox8-1 wox9-1 globular stage embryos (n = 19;
Figure 3L; Table S7), suggesting a requirement of WOX8/
WOX9 activity for normal PIN1:PIN1-GFP expression. The min-
ority of embryos that appear unaffected indicates that this re-
quirement is not absolute. Cytokinin often has antagonistic func-
tions to auxin in plant development and plays an important role
during embryonic shoot development (Chaudhury et al., 1993).
In contrast to auxin response, however, cytokinin response,
analyzed by a YFP version of the commonly used cytokinin

response gene ARR5:GUS (D’Agostino et al., 2000), was not
affected in wox8-1 wox9-1 embryos (data not shown).

In summary, wox8/wox9 mutations affect expression of the
PIN1:PIN1-GFP reporter and localize auxin response in the
embryo.

Interaction of WOX and MP Genes
The ARF transcription factor MP is a central component of
the auxin machinery during embryogenesis and promotes
PIN1:PIN1-GFP expression and auxin ﬂux (Weijers et al.,
2006). We therefore investigated whether WOX2 and WOX8
might act together with MP.

mpB4149 embryos failed to initiate root development (Fig-
ure 4B), and cotyledon and shoot meristem were often mal-
formed at the seedling stage (Figures 4K and 4L; Weijers et al.,
2006). The shoot defects were strongly enhanced by the wox8-
1 mutation, resulting in a majority of arrested, spherically shaped
embryos that did not initiate cotyledon primordia (Figure 4D;
Table S1). wox2-1 mpB4149/+ segregating embryos displayed a
dramatically increased frequency of protoderm defects (69%,
n = 177)
in comparison with wox2-1 single mutants (30%,
n = 158). This increase was signiﬁcantly higher than that ex-
pected for a recessive function of the mp allele (p = 0.0359),

indicating a semidominant effect of the mpB4149 mutation in the
wox2-1 background. wox2-1 mpB4149 seedlings also displayed
enhanced shoot patterning defects and occasionally produced
only a rudimentary shoot (4%, n = 116, compare with Figure 4M),
which was never observed in either single mutant. All defects in
the apical cell
lineage were further enhanced when wox2-1,
wox8-1, and mpB4149 mutations were combined (Figures 4E
and 4F), resulting in a majority of triple mutant seedlings (72%,
n = 84) with only rudimentary shoot tissue (Figure 4M).

In summary, all combinations of wox2-1 and wox8-1 with the
mpB4149 mutant displayed defects that appeared more severe
than expected from an additive combination of the single mutant
phenotypes, suggesting that the WOX and MP pathways in em-
bryo patterning converge at some point.

We next analyzed PIN1:PIN1-GFP expression and localized
auxin response. In comparison with PIN1:PIN1-GFP expression
in the entire provasculature and the epidermis of cotyledons of
wild-type, provascular PIN1:PIN1-GFP expression was unde-
tectable in the lower part of mpB4149 single mutant embryos (Fig-
ure 4G). In phenotypic wox8-1 mpB4149 embryos (18% of segre-
gating embryos), PIN1:PIN1-GFP expression was additionally
undetectable in the provasculature of the upper part of the em-
bryo, but remained detectable in the epidermal cell layer cover-
ing most of the embryo apex (Figure 4H). The wox2-1 mutation
further reduced the epidermal signal to a ring around the apical
embryo (Figure 4I). mpB4149 single mutant embryos lacked de-
tectable DR5rev:GFP expression at the position of the hypophy-
sis, whereas a localized signal at the tip of the cotyledon or cot-
yledons was present, as reported previously (Weijers et al.,
2006). This expression domain was extended across the whole
apex of wox2-1 wox8-1 mpB4149 triple mutant embryos (n = 16;
Figure 4N), suggesting that auxin was not properly localized. No-
tably, wox2-1 wox8-1 double mutant embryos displayed wild-
type PIN1:PIN1-GFP (Figure 4J) and DR5rev:GFP expression
patterns (data not shown).

In summary, WOX2 and WOX8 appear to act redundantly with
MP to promote PIN1:PIN1-GFP expression in the cotyledon vas-
culature, and both affect the formation of localized auxin re-
sponse maxima.

WOX2 Restores Apical Cell Fates in wox8 wox9
Mutant Embryos
Our ﬁndings, that WOX2 reporter expression in the proembryo is
dependent on WOX8/WOX9 and that WOX2 and WOX8 genes
both cooperate with MP in PIN1 regulation, raised the possibility
that WOX2 mediates WOX8/WOX9 functions in the proembryo.
Therefore, we reconstituted WOX2 expression in wox8-1 wox9-1
embryos via a WOX9 promoter fragment that was initially in the
zygote, the suspensor, and the proembryo (Figure 5F), before
becoming restricted to the basal lineage after the 8-cell stage
(inset of Figure 5F).

Reconstituted WOX2 expression in wox8-1 wox9-1/+ resulted
in zygotes that failed to elongate (Figure 5A) and that gave rise
to two daughter cells of almost equal size (Figures 5B and 5J).
During further divisions, the cells in both lineages remained
small, isodiametric, and densely cytoplasmic, in contrast to
wox8-1 wox9-1 alone (Figures 5C–5E). Notably, the cells in
the basal
lineage divided in seemingly random orientations
rather than transversely (Figure 5D) and, unlike in wild-type or

872 Developmental Cell 14, 867–876, June 2008 ª2008 Elsevier Inc.

wox8-1 wox9-1, they did not become vacuolated and did not
elongate to push the embryo into the lumen of the seed
(Figure 5E).

Next we asked whether gene expression programs deﬁcient in
wox8 wox9 embryos were restored by reinstated WOX2 function.
Expression of WOX5:NLS-vYFP3 was restored at the stage when
WOX5 expression commenced in the cotyledon primordia of
wild-type, but not at earlier stages representing the initiation of
the root stem cell niche (Figure 5G; Table S8). PIN1:PIN1-GFP
expression was also restored to detectable levels in approxi-
mately half of the homozygous wox8-1 wox9-1 embryos (Fig-
ure 5H; Table S8). GFP signal was conﬁned to the apical proto-
derm and to a discrete central domain (asterisk in Figure 5H),
reminiscent of PIN1:PIN1-GFP expression in the cotyledon tips
and the provasculature of corresponding wild-type torpedo
stage embryos (compare inset of Figure 4H). Importantly, local-
ized DR5rev:GFP expression in transgenic embryos was restored
at the presumptive root pole (inset of Figure 5I) and, in one-third of
cases, also at the tip of the embryo (n = 27; Figure 5I), similar to the
localization of auxin response maxima in the root and the tips of
the cotyledons in wild-type, respectively (compare inset of
Figure 4N).

Notably, transgenic WOX2 expression had no effect in either
single mutant or wild-type controls (Table S9), and expression
of WOX8 or WOX9 cDNAs from the same promoter completely
restored wild-type development (data not shown). The effects
of WOX2 expression in wox8 wox9 were strikingly similar to
the phenotype of yda mutants (Lukowitz et al., 2004). The
MAPKK kinase YDA represses zygote elongation and apical
fate in the basal daughter linage. We therefore addressed
whether YDA might be placed in context with WOX8/WOX9 by
analyzing the yda wox8 wox9 triple mutant. Triple mutant zy-
gotes were indistinguishable from yda single mutant zygotes,
generating two small isodiametric daughter cells. However, sub-
sequent development of the two daughter cells was completely
arrested (Table 1), something not observed to a similar extent
in either yda or wox8 wox9, indicating that these genes do not
operate in a linear pathway.

Taken together, our data suggest that wox8 wox9 mutants are
defective in both apical and basal gene expression programs,
and that restoration of WOX2 expression is sufﬁcient to establish
important aspects of proembryo fates in both apical and basal
lineages of wox8 wox9 embryos.

DISCUSSION

The establishment of distinct transcriptional domains is a key
step in determining different cell fates during embryo develop-
ment. Our results suggest a model where apical-basal axis for-
mation in the Arabidopsis embryo is governed by a combination
of asymmetric cell divisions and cell-cell communication: the
zygote expresses a mixture of the homeodomain transcription
factors WOX2 and WOX8, which act as key regulators of apical
and basal fates, respectively. By an as yet unknown mechanism,
the expression domains of these regulators become separated
with the asymmetric zygotic division, providing each daughter
cell with a speciﬁc transcription program and setting the stage
for the organization of auxin ﬂux and response in the early
embryo.

WOX Genes Act as Cell-Lineage-Speciﬁc
Developmental Regulators
Mutations in either WOX2 or WOX8 have only weak or no effects,
but additional mutations in their closest homologs reveal that
both gene functions are crucial regulators of early embryo devel-
opment. Previous studies using stimpy (wox9) and stimpy-like
(wox8) mutants have highlighted cell proliferation defects in
wox8 wox9 mutants at later stages of development (Wu et al.,
2007). The data presented here demonstrate that WOX8 and
its redundant partner WOX9 regulate gene expression programs,
cell morphology, and division patterns in both the basal and the
apical lineage from the 1-cell embryo stage on.

Several scenarios may explain how WOX8/WOX9 activities
affect development of the proembryo. WOX8 mRNA expression

is detected in the zygote and the basal lineage (Haecker et al.,
2004). WOX9 mRNA and reporter gene expression also appears
to be predominantly in the basal lineage until the early globular
stage embryo (Haecker et al., 2004, and Figure S2), but a broader
expression pattern has also been reported (Wu et al., 2007). It is
possible that abnormalities in the wox8 wox9 proembryo origi-
nate from a lack of WOX8 and/or WOX9 function in the zygote.
However, loss of WOX8 function in a wox2 or mp background
causes aberrations in shoot patterning that do not become visi-
ble before the emergence of cotyledon primordia at approxi-
mately 5 days post fertilization, making this scenario unlikely.
While we cannot exclude the possibility that WOX8 and WOX9
are expressed in the apical lineage below the detection limits
in our experiments, a model that is consistent with our data

suggests that WOX8/WOX9 activities trigger a signal from the
basal to the apical lineage, which is essential for sustained devel-
opment of the proembryo. Such an instructive function of the
basal
lineage is consistent with current models of auxin ﬂux
from the basal cell into the apical cell, which facilitates its devel-
opment into a proembryo (Friml et al., 2003).

An Early Embryonic WOX Gene Cascade Involved
in Graded Auxin Distribution
Consistent with an inductive effect from the basal to the apical
lineage, our data suggest that WOX2 expression in the apical lin-
eage is an early and important downstream function of WOX8/
WOX9 activity: expression of a WOX2 reporter in wox8 wox9
embryos was not detected; WOX2 is required in the proembryo
for the periclinal cell divisions separating the protoderm from
inner cells, as well as for patterning of the shoot apex; and trans-
genic expression experiments indicate that WOX2 promotes
several aspects of apical fate. Since the redundant functions of
WOX1, WOX5, and PRS become essential for normal develop-
ment of the apical lineage only in the absence of WOX2 activity,
WOX2 appears to be the most important WOX gene for shoot
patterning.

Early WOX gene functions affect expression of PIN1:PIN1-GFP
and DR5rev:GFP, linking the WOX transcriptional machinery to
the establishment of localized auxin response in the proembryo.
Based on mutant combinations with mp, PIN1:PIN1-GFP expres-
sion in provascular cells appears most affected. Because alter-
ations in PIN1:PIN1-GFP and DR5rev:GFP expression in wox
mutants were observed later than other effects, this interaction
might involve intermediate steps. Previous studies have revealed
a positive feedback between auxin accumulation and PIN1:PIN1-
GFP expression (Vieten et al., 2005). Reduction of PIN1:PIN1-
GFP expression in the majority of wox8 wox9 embryos, despite
an apparent strong and uniform accumulation of auxin, is consis-
tent with auxin involving WOX in promoting PIN1 expression in
the early embryo. Notably, however, we found WOX2 expression
itself not affected by auxin (Figure S3).

Loss of PIN1 function alone does not have a striking effect on
auxin distribution or embryo development, because it is com-
pensated for by the upregulation of other PIN genes, namely
PIN3, PIN4, and PIN7 (Blilou et al., 2005; Friml et al., 2003; Vieten
et al., 2005). This implies that reduction of only PIN1 could not

874 Developmental Cell 14, 867–876, June 2008 ª2008 Elsevier Inc.

for

account
the uniform auxin distribution in wox8 wox9
embryos, and therefore it appears likely that the WOX cascade
also affects genes involved in auxin localization other than
PIN1. In addition, WOX genes clearly have important functions
that go beyond auxin localization, because the developmental
defects of wox8 wox9 embryos are considerably more severe
than the defects reported for auxin-related embryo mutants.

WOX Genes and the Asymmetric Division of the Zygote
An intriguing question is what role WOX2 and WOX8 play in the
zygote. The analysis of loss-of-function mutants has not yet re-
vealed any function for these genes at this stage—a result that
might in part be due to the lack of appropriate molecular
markers. However, transgenic expression of WOX2 represses
elongation of the zygote and renders its division more symmet-
ric, similar to the phenotype observed with mutations in the
YDA gene (Lukowitz et al., 2004). Because this effect only be-
comes apparent in the absence of WOX8 and WOX9, a likely
explanation is that wox8 wox9 zygotes do not express WOX2
(see above), making them deﬁcient in all three WOX functions.

An implication of this scenario is that the wild-type zygote not
only expresses a mixture of apical and basal cell fate regulators,
but that their balanced activity is crucial for its ability to divide
unequally and to establish distinct fates in its daughters. While
the mechanistic basis for this asymmetric division remains to
be determined, the nonadditive effect of wox8 wox9 mutants
with mutations in the MAPKK kinase YDA suggest that signaling
through the YDA pathway and WOX-dependent transcriptional
regulation are both critical.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Plant Material
Plants were grown on soil or in sterile culture on 0.53 MS medium containing
Murashige and Skoog salts. After incubation for at least 4 days at 4C in dark-
ness, plants were grown in growth chambers under long-day conditions (16 hr
light and 8 hr dark) at 18C. The Arabidopsis mutants wox2-1, wox2-2, prs,
wox5-1, mpB4149, and bdl-1 have been described previously (Haecker et al.,
2004; Hamann et al., 1999; Matsumoto and Okada, 2001; Sarkar et al.,
2007; Weijers et al., 2006). A T-DNA insertion mutant in the WOX1 gene
(At3g18010) was obtained from the Versailles T-DNA insertion collection (Was-
silevskija accession; Bechtold et al., 1993). The wox8-1 insertion line in the
Wassilevskija accession was obtained from the Arabidopsis Knockout Facility
of the University of Wisconsin (Krysan et al., 1999). A wox8-2 insertion line in
the Columbia accession was identiﬁed in the SALK insertion collection by da-
tabase search (Alonso et al., 2003). The wox9-1 allele in the Columbia acces-
sion was isolated from the ZIGIA transposon collection in Cologne (Wisman
et al., 1998). For genotyping protocols of the new mutant lines used, please
see Supplemental Experimental Procedures available online. The ﬂuorescent
markers PIN1:PIN1-GFP (Benkova et al., 2003), DR5rev:GFP (Friml et al.,
2003), and AtML1:NLS-GFP3 (Takada and Ju¨ rgens, 2007) were kindly pro-
vided by J. Friml and G. Ju¨ rgens (Tu¨ bingen). Signiﬁcance tests were performed
using the two-tail Fisher’s Exact Test (http://www.langsrud.com/ﬁsher.htm).

Construction of the Promoter and Protein Fusions
For the WOX8gD:NLS-vYFP3 reporter the homeodomain sequence of WOX8
was removed from the genomic sequence by a deletion of 425 bp including
the ﬁrst exon and the beginning of the second exon. gD designates the deletion
from the genomic fragment. At the 30 end of the genomic sequence, a BglII site
was introduced, replacing the STOP codon, and a NLS-vYFP3 fragment (Nagai
et al., 2002) was inserted. The promoter fusion of WOX9 was generated by in-
serting a BamHI site at the 50 and the 30 end of the genomic sequence, remov-
ing the coding sequence. This BamHI site was used to introduce the second

Developmental Cell

intron and a NLS-vYFP3. The promoter fusions contain the sequences be-
tween the closest annotated upstream genes and the ATG (start codon) of
WOX8 and WOX9. At the 30 end, each construct contains the genomic region
between the STOP codon of either WOX8 or WOX9 and the next annotated
downstream genes. The WOX2 reporter was generated using the 3 kb up-
stream sequence of the ATG fused to NLS-YFP and the CaMV35S terminator.
The ARR5:NLS-vYFP3 was constructed by replacing the GUS sequence of the
previously described ARR5 reporter (D’Agostino et al., 2000) with a NLS-vYFP3
sequence. Details of cloning procedures are available as online information
(Supplemental Experimental Procedures).

Microscopy
Nomarski microscopy analysis was performed using a chloral hydrate solution
(containing glycerin, chloral hydrate, and water in a ratio of 1:8:3) on a Zeiss
Imager A1 with DIC optics. For ﬂuorescent analysis the prepared ovules
were placed in 10% glycerin and analyzed using the Zeiss ﬁlters 46HE for
YFP and 38HE for GFP. After the 16-cell stage, wox8 wox9 embryos could
be reproducibly dissected from ovules; for earlier stages, whole-mount imma-
ture seeds were imaged.
