Summary This  paper  surveys  the  debate
regarding  Esping-Andersen’s 
typology  of
welfare  states  and  reviews  the  modified  or
alternative 
this
debate. We confine ourselves to the classifica-
tions  which  have  been  developed  by  Esping-
Andersen’s  critics  in  order  to  cope  with  the
following  alleged  shortcomings  of  his  typol-
ogy:  (1)  the  misspecification  of  the  Mediter-
ranean welfare states as immature Continental
ones;  (2)  the  labelling  of  the  Antipodean
welfare  states  as  belonging  to  the  ‘liberal’
regime  type;  (3)  a  neglect  of  the  gender-
dimension  in  social  policy.  We  reconstruct
several typologies of welfare states in order to
establish, first, whether real welfare states are
quite  similar  to  others  or  whether  they  are
rather unique specimens, and, second, whether
there are three ideal-typical worlds of welfare
capitalism  or  more.  We  conclude  that  real
welfare  states  are  hardly  ever  pure  types  and
are usually hybrid cases; and that the issue of
ideal-typical welfare states cannot be satisfac-
torily answered given the lack of formal theo-
rizing  and  the  still  inconclusive  outcomes  of
comparative  research.  In  spite  of  this  conclu-
sion  there  is  plenty  of  reason  to  continue  to
work  on  and  with  the  original  or  modified
typologies.

Introduction

When  Esping-Andersen  (1990)  published  his
Three  Worlds  of  Welfare  Capitalism it  was
received  with  applause  (Offe,  1991;  Cnaan,
1992;  Hicks,  1991;  Kohl,  1993).  After  a  few
years, the book even became a modern classic.
Nevertheless,  Esping-Andersen  (1993;  1994;
1996; 1997; 1999) has been forced time after
time  by  both  his  critics  and  his  adherents  to
elaborate on his original arguments. The tenet
of  Esping-Andersen’s  treatise  of  the  welfare
state was that, for a long time in both the the-
oretical  and  empirical  literature,  too  little
attention had been given to cross-national dif-
ferences in welfare state structures.1 In spite of
this putative lack of attention he could – theo-
retically and empirically – stand ‘on the shoul-
ders  of  giants’.  Theoretically,  the  work  of
Marshall  (1950;  1963;  1965;  1981)  and
Titmuss (1958; 1974) laid the foundations for
Esping-Andersen’s  typology  (Boje,  1996:  19).
Empirically, he could profit from the compar-
ative  research  by,  among  others,  Wilensky
(1975),  Flora  and  Heidenheimer  (1981),
Mommsen (1981) and Flora (1983; 1986). He
argued  that  we  are  entering  better  times
because ‘the most intensive activity of welfare
state  theorising  at  the  moment  has  become
identifying  diversity,  specifying  welfare  state
typologies’  (Esping-Andersen,  1994:  715).
Research  has  to  follow  theory’s  lead  because
‘only comparative empirical research will ade-
quately  disclose  the  fundamental  properties
that  unite  or  divide  modern  welfare  states’
(Esping-Andersen,  1990:  3).  In  his  ‘seminal’
book he suited the action to the word by con-
structing  today’s  best-known  and  most  fre-
quently  used  typology  of  welfare  states,  and
by empirically testing whether distinct welfare
states  that  resemble  his  ideal-types  can  be
observed.

For  accomplishing  this  feat,  he  not  only
received wide critical acclaim and constructive
critism, but also some negative criticism. The
more amicable critics argue that his typology
has merits but is neither exhaustive nor exclu-
sive and therefore needs revising. Others refer

Journal of European Social Policy 2002 12 (2)

to  theoretical  and  methodological  shortcom-
ings  (cf.  Lessenich  and  Ostner,  1998).  The
more hostile critics feel that typologies as such
have no explanatory power and, therefore, his
scheme does not contribute to proper theoriz-
ing about what is happening with and within
welfare states (cf. Baldwin, 1996).

In  this  paper,  we  give  an  overview  of  the
debate  about  Esping-Andersen’s 
typology
during the last decade and review the state of
the  art  of  typifying  welfare  states  at  the  turn
of  the  millennium.  The  pivotal  questions  are
as follows: How and why has the welfare state
developed? How and why do national welfare
systems differ from one another – or are they
similar  to  each  other?  Do  welfare  states
cluster  into  different  regime  types  and,  if  so,
how and why? It is not our intention to raise
new  questions.  Our  objective  is  to  settle
affairs,  for  the  time  being,  by  giving  an
overview  of  what  we  think  is  the  gist  of  the
discussion,  by  weighting  the  most  important
arguments  and  taking  stock  of  the  modelling
business. To achieve this goal, we elaborate on
earlier overviews by Abrahamson (1999), Arts
and  Gelissen  (1999)  and  Kohl  (2000).  First,
we  review  the  debate  with  respect  to  Esping-
Andersen’s typology and modified versions of
it.  Second,  we  try  to  establish  whether  there
are three ideal-typical worlds of welfare capi-
talism  or  more.  Third,  we  outline  which
authors  identify  which  national  states  as
belonging to a particular type of welfare state.
This means that we will not only look at ideal
worlds  of  welfare  capitalism,  but  also  at  real
ones.

Ideal-types

Do typologies based on ideal-types have theo-
retical and empirical value as Esping-Andersen
assumes?  The  conclusion  emerging  from  the
philosophy of science literature is clear: not if
ideal-types are goals in themselves, but only if
they are the means to a goal; namely, the rep-
resentation of a reality, which cannot (yet) be
described  using  laws  (Klant,  1984).  This

means  that  typologies  are  only  fruitful  to  an
empirical science that is still in its infancy. In
contrast,  a  mature  empirical  science  empha-
sizes the construction of theories and not the
formulation  of  typologies.  There  are  good
reasons to argue that the comparative macro-
sociology  of  welfare  states  is  still  in  statu
nascendi. Therefore the formulation of typolo-
gies  could  be  useful.  Before  answering  the
question  of  whether  welfare  state  typologies
based  on  ideal-types  are  not  only  useful  but
also have explanatory value, we first consider
what Esping-Andersen himself says about the
methodological status of his typology.

He  addresses  the  question  of  whether  the
welfare  state  is  merely  the  sum  total  of  a
nation’s social policy repertoire, or whether it
is  an  institutional  force  above  and  beyond  a
given  policy  array.  His  answer  is  straightfor-
ward: the welfare state cannot be regarded as
the sum total of social policies, it is more than
a numerical cumulation of discrete programmes
(Esping-Andersen,  1994:  712).  Therefore,  in
the  relation  between  state  and  economy,  he
defines welfare state regimes as a complex of
legal and organizational features that are sys-
tematically 
interwoven.  Esping-Andersen
(1990:  3,  26,  32)  boldly  suggests  that  when
we  focus  on  the  principles  embedded  in
welfare  states,  variations  are  not  linearly  dis-
tributed around a common denominator. They
are  clustered  around  three  highly  diverse
regime-types,  each  organized  according  to  its
own  discrete  logic  of  organization,  stratifica-
tion,  and  societal  integration.  Therefore,  we
can  identify  three  models,  or  ideal-types  of
welfare states: conservative, liberal and social-
democratic.  These

origins  to  different  historical  forces  and  they
follow  qualitatively  different  developmental
trajectories.  Contrary  to  the  ideal  world  of
welfare  states,  the  real  world  is  likely  to
exhibit hybrid forms. There are no one-dimen-
sional  nations  in  the  sense  of  a  pure  case.
Today,  every  country  presents  a  system  mix.
Esping-Andersen  (1997:  171)  argues  that
despite  this  it  is  fruitful  to  construct  ideal-
types  for  the  sake  of  economy:  to  be  able  to

ideal-types  owe 

see the forest rather than the myriad of unique
trees.  However,  he  warns  of  the  danger  that
the resulting forest may bear little resemblance
to reality.

Looking  for  a  more  detailed  answer  to  the
question of the theoretical status of ideal-types
and  typologies,  we  must  return  to  the  locus
classicus:  Weber’s  methodological  essays.
Weber  (1949;  1968  [1922])  deals  with  two
different  kinds  of  ideal-types,  individualistic
and  holistic  ones  (cf.  Hempel,  1965  [1952];
Rogers, 1969; Watkins, 1969 [1953]). Esping-
Andersen’s ideal-types of welfare state regimes
are holistic. They propose to give a bird’s eye
view of the broad characteristics of a social or
historical situation. The ideality of such types
lies in their simplification and aloofness from
detail. They emphasize the ‘essential’ features
of a situation considered as a whole. By com-
paring an impure welfare state with an ideal-
typical one – both considered as a whole – the
deviations  of  the  former  from  the  latter  are
thrown  into  relief.  It  is  the  simultaneous
knowledge of both the ideal-type and the real-
type  that  enables  holistic  ideal-types  to  be
used  ‘as  conceptual  instruments  for  compari-
son  with  and  measurement  of 
reality’
(Watkins, 1969 [1953]: 458–9).

From a logical point of view (von Kempski,
1972),  the  general  term  ‘welfare  state’  is  a
label  for  a  certain  class  of  democratic  indus-
trial  capitalist  societies,  characterized  by
certain properties (i.e. social citizenship or the
fact that more or less extensive welfare provi-
sions  are  legally  provided,  or,  in  still  other
words, the fact that the state plays a principal
part in the welfare mix alongside the market,
civil  society,  and  the  family).  Welfare  states
have seldom been established as a result of big
plans  or  big  fights,  but  mostly  as  results  of
complex  processes  and  successive  steps  of
social  and  political  engineering  in  the  history
of democratic industrial capitalist societies. In
spite  of  the  largely  incremental  emergence  of
welfare  states,  Esping-Andersen  is  of  the
opinion  that  this  class  of  societies  does  not
consist  of  a  great  number  of  unique  cases, 
but that they cluster together in three distinct

subclasses.  Each  of  the  three  types  he  identi-
fies with a deep tradition in political mobiliza-
tion  and  political  philosophy  (conservatism,
liberalism  and  socialism  respectively)  which
then  link  to  particular  features  of  contempo-
rary  social  policy  (and  broader  political
economy) configurations.

is 

types.  The  consequence 

To  determine  the  characteristics  of  these
subclasses without going back in history, two
indicators are crucial: decommodification and
stratification.  Together  they  define  a  two-
dimensional  property-space.  Although  real
welfare states are most of the time not unique,
they  certainly  are  never  completely  similar.
This  means  that  they  are  almost  always
impure 
that
although  they  cluster  together  in  three  sub-
classes it is not always easy to classify all cases
unambiguously.  In  practice  it  is  possible  that
different  judges  assign  a  particular  welfare
state  to  different  subclasses.  Interjudge  valid-
ity  can  be  accomplished  by  assessing  which
ideal-type – the extreme limiting cases in this
ordering – they approximate best. By compar-
ing  impure  real  welfare  states  to  ideal-types,
the  deviations  of  the  ‘impure’  real-types  are
contrasted  with  the  ‘purity’  of  the  ideal-type.
This simultaneous recognizability of both the
ideal and the real-type make it possible to use
holistic  ideal-types  as  conceptual  instruments
for comparison and for the empirical determi-
nation of reality (Watkins, 1969 [1953]). But
accurate  ordering  is  not  enough.  After  all,
ideal-types are also instruments for providing
explanations.  If  we  use  them  to  satisfy  this
objective, they should not only be understood
as  a  conceptual  system  but  also  as  a  system

statements.  These 

To  what  conclusion  does  the  preceding
reflection lead? In reply to Esping-Andersen’s
fiercest critics, we can say that their criticism
is  unjust  if  certain  conditions  are  met.  The
first  condition  is  that  the  typology  is  a  valid
and reliable instrument for classifying welfare
states.  Whether  this  condition  holds  will  be

Journal of European Social Policy 2002 12 (2)

tested later on in this paper. The second con-
dition  is  that  the  typology  is  a  means  to  an
end – explanation – and not an end in itself.
Esping-Andersen  uses  the  regime  types  not
only  as  dependent  variables  but  also  as  inde-
pendent  variables  to  explain  cross-national
variations  in  dependent  variables  such  as
social behaviour and social attitudes. He also
uses the typology to postulate and explain the
occurrence of positive feedback loops. Accord-
ing  to  him,  existing  institutional  welfare
arrangements  heavily  determine,  maybe  even
over-determine,  national  trajectories  (Esping-
Andersen,  1999:  4).  This  suggests  path-
dependency.  This  is  because  the  stratification
outcomes  of  particular  arrangements  shape
class  coalitions,  which  tend  to  reproduce  the
original  institutional  matrix  and  welfare  out-
comes. This means that policies provide incen-
tives that encourage individuals and groups to
act  in  ways  that  lock  in  a  particular  path  of
policy development (cf. Pierson, 1993).

A third condition for accepting typologizing
as  a  legitimate  endeavour  is  that  theory  con-
struction  on  welfare  states  is  still  in  an  early
stage. This is also true. Boje (1996: 18) argues
that  the  present  ‘state  of  the  art’  in  most
welfare  state  research  is  characterized  by  a
lack of theory. Few theoretical alternatives are
available.  At  the  most,  one  can  think  of
marxist  explanations 
for  example
Therborn, 1995) or de Swaan’s (1988) synthe-
sis of rational-choice theories and figurational
sociology. The construction of ideal-types can
be fruitful under the condition that these will
eventually  lead  to  theories.  We  will  return  to
this issue in the final section.

(see, 

Three worlds of ‘welfare 
capitalism’ . . .

The  central  explanatory  questions  Esping-
Andersen (1990: 4, 105) asks are: Why is the
world  composed  of  three  qualitatively  differ-
ent welfare-state logics? Why do nations crys-
tallize  into  distinct  regime-clusters?  These
questions  demand  a  theoretical  answer.  Since

he is of the opinion that the existing theoreti-
cal models of the welfare state are inadequate,
reconceptualization  and  retheorization  are
necessary.  In  answering  these  questions  he
starts with the orienting statement that history
and politics matter. Or, more specifically: ‘The
historical  characteristics  of  states,  especially
the  history  of  political  class  coalitions  as  the
most decisive cause of welfare-state variations,
have played a determinate role in forging the
emergence of their welfare-statism’ (1990: 1).
What are the historical and political forces
behind  the  regime  differences?  According  to
Esping-Andersen (1990: 29), three interacting
factors  are  significant:  the  nature  of  class
mobilization (especially of the working class),
class-political  action  structures,  and  the  his-
torical  legacy  of  regime  institutionalization.
The  provisional  answer  to  his  central  ques-
tions is therefore: If you look at the history of
so-called  welfare  states  you  find  three  ideal-
typical  trajectories,  a  liberal,  a  conservative
and a social-democratic one. Fortunately, one
does not have to go back in history, however,
in order to typify ‘real’ welfare states. We can
characterize  them,  as  we  have  mentioned
before,  by  looking  at  their  positions  on  two
fundamental dimensions of welfare statism:

1. The degree of decommodification, i.e. the
degree  to  which  a  (social)  service  is  ren-
dered as a matter of right, and the degree
to  which  a  person  can  maintain  a  liveli-
hood without reliance on the market.

2. The kind of social stratification and soli-
darities,  i.e.  which  social  stratification
system  is  promoted  by  social  policy  and
does  the  welfare  state  build  narrow  or
broad solidarities?

What  are  the  characteristics  of  the  three  dis-
tinct  regime-types  to  which  the  historical
forces lead? To answer this question, Esping-
Andersen (1990: 73) argues that although the
before-mentioned dimensions are conceptually
independent,  according  to  his  ‘theory’  he
would  expect  that  there  is  sufficient  covaria-
tion for distinct regime clusters to emerge. In

accordance  with  this  theoretical  expectation,
he  succeeds  in  empirically  identifying  three
closely  paralleled  models  –  ideal-types  –  of
regime-types on both the stratification and the
decommodification dimension. There appears
to be a clear coincidence of high decommodi-
fication  and  strong  universalism

welfare states. There is an equally clear coinci-
dence  of  low  decommodification  and  strong

European  countries  group  closely  together  as

the
Netherlands  and  Switzerland,  the  overall
picture  is  convincing,  at  least  at  first  glance.
This  empirical  success  permits  a  more  exten-
sive  description  of  these  three  worlds  of
welfare  capitalism.  First,  there  is  the  liberal
type  of  welfare  capitalism,  which  embodies
individualism and the primacy of the market.
The operation of the market is encouraged by
the  state,  either  actively  –  subsidizing  private
welfare  schemes  –  or  passively  by  keeping
(often  means  tested)  social  benefits  to  a
modest  level  for  the  demonstrably  needy.
There is little redistribution of incomes within
this  type  of  welfare  state  and  the  realm  of
social  rights  is  rather  limited.  This  welfare
regime  is  characterized  by  a  low  level  of
decommodification.  The  operation  of  the
liberal principle of stratification leads to divi-
sion  in  the  population:  on  the  one  hand,  a
minority of low-income state dependants and,
on  the  other  hand,  a  majority  of  people  able
to afford private social insurance plans. In this
type  of  welfare  state,  women  are  encouraged
to participate in the labour force, particularly
in the service sector.

Second,  there  is  a  world  of  conservative-
corporatist welfare states, which is typified by
a  moderate  level  of  decommodification.  This
regime  type  is  shaped  by  the  twin  historical
legacy  of  Catholic  social  policy,2 on  the  one
side,  and  corporatism  and  etatism  on  the
other  side.  This  blend  had  three  important

Journal of European Social Policy 2002 12 (2)

142

Arts and Gelissen

consequences in terms of stratification. In the
first  place,  the  direct  influence  of  the  state  is
restricted  to  the  provision  of  income  mainte-
nance  benefits  related  to  occupational  status.
This  means  that  the  sphere  of  solidarity
remains  quite  narrow  and 
corporatist.
Moreover,  labour  market  participation  by
married  women 
is  strongly  discouraged,
because  corporatist  regimes  –  influenced  by
the  Church  –  are  committed  to  the  preserva-
tion  of  traditional  family  structures.  Another
important  characteristic  of  the  conservative
regime type is the principle of subsidiarity: the
state  will  only  interfere  when  the  family’s
capacity  to  service  its  members  is  exhausted
(Esping-Andersen, 1990: 27).
Finally,  Esping-Andersen 

recognizes  a
social-democratic world of welfare capitalism.
Here, the level of decommodification is high,
and the social-democratic principle of stratifi-
cation is directed towards achieving a system
of  generous  universal  and  highly  distributive
benefits not dependent on any individual con-
tributions.  In  contrast  to  the  liberal  type  of
welfare  states,  ‘this  model  crowds  out  the
market  and,  consequently,  constructs  an
essentially universal solidarity in favour of the
welfare  state’  (Esping-Andersen,  1990:  28).
Social policy within this type of welfare state
is  aimed  at  a  maximization  of  capacities  for
individual independence. Women in particular
– regardless of whether they have children or
not  –  are  encouraged  to  participate  in  the
labour market, especially in the public sector.
Countries  that  belong  to  this  type  of  welfare
state  regime  are  generally  dedicated  to  full
employment.  Only  by  making  sure  that  as
many people as possible have a job is it possi-
ble  to  maintain  such  a  high-level  solidaristic
welfare system.

. . . Or more?

In the Introduction, we indicated the tremen-
dous  impact  of  Esping-Andersen’s  work  on
comparative social policy analysis. Since then,
several  authors  have  developed  alternative

Journal of European Social Policy 2002 12 (2)

typologies  or  added  one  or  more  types  to
existing  classifications  for  greater  empirical
refinement.  From  this  vast  array  of  welfare
state typologies we have selected six classifica-
tions, which we think draw attention to inter-
esting  characteristics  of  welfare  states  not
directly included in Esping-Andersen’s classifi-
cation.  All  these  typologies  and  their  main
characteristics are summarized in Table 1.

important 

These  alternative  classifications  relate  to
three 
criticisms  of  Esping-
Andersen’s  classification  (for  these  and  other
points  of  critique  see  Schmidt,  1998;  Gough,
2000b).3 First,  the  misspecification  of  the
Mediterranean welfare states; second, labelling
the Antipodean welfare states as belonging to
the  ‘liberal’  welfare  state  regime;  and  finally,
the  neglect  of  the  gender-dimension  in  social
policy.  In  the  following  sections,  we  will
discuss  these  criticisms  in  more  detail  and
present  some  of  the  alternative  classifications
developed by his critics.

The Mediterranean

One important criticism of Esping-Andersen’s
classification is that he did not systematically
include 
countries.
Specifically,  in  The  Three  Worlds  of  Welfare
Capitalism Italy belongs – according to him –
to  the  family  of  the  corporatist  welfare  state
regimes,  whereas  Spain,  Portugal  and  Greece
are not covered by his typology. Although he
admits that these countries have some impor-
tant  characteristics 
i.e.  a
Catholic 
imprint  (with  the  exception  of
Greece)  and  a  strong  familialism  (Esping-
Andersen,  1997:  180)  –  he  seems  to  include
them in the continental/corporatist model. His
omission  of  a  systematic  treatment  of  the
Mediterranean  has  brought  about  a  lively
debate about the existence of a ‘Southern’ or
‘Latin  Rim’  model  of  social  policy.  For
example,  Katrougalos 
supports
Esping-Andersen’s  position  by  arguing  that
the  Mediterranean  countries  ‘do  not  form  a
distinct  group  but  rather  a  subcategory,  a

species  of 

variant  of  the  Continental  model.  They  are
merely  underdeveloped 
the
Continental  model,  welfare  states  in  their
infancy, with the main common characteristics
being  the  immaturity  of  the  social  protection
systems  and  some  similar  social  and  family
structures’ (Katrougalos, 1996: 43). However,
according  to  other  commentators  (Leibfried,
1992;  Ferrera,  1996;  Bonoli,  1997;  Trifiletti,
1999)  it  seems  logical  to  see  the  South
European  countries  as  a  separate  cluster. 
They  have  developed 
classifications  of
European welfare states which try to show the
existence  of  a  separate  ‘southern  model’  of
social policy.

Leibfried  (1992)  distinguishes  four  social
policy or poverty regimes within the countries
of  the  European  Community:  the  Scandina-
vian  welfare  states,  the  ‘Bismarck’  countries,
the Anglo–Saxon countries and the Latin Rim
countries.  These  policy  regimes  are  based  on
different  policy  models  –  modern,  institu-
tional,  residual  and  rudimentary  –  in  which
social  citizenship  has  developed  in  different
and sometimes incomplete ways. Within these
policy regimes, welfare state institutions have
a  different  function  in  combating  poverty.
However,  it  is  particularly  important  that
Leibfried  adds  a  fourth  category  –  the  ‘Latin
Rim’ countries – to Esping-Andersen’s original
classification. He emphasizes as an important
characteristic of these countries the lack of an
articulated  social  minimum  and  a  right  to
welfare.

Ferrera (1996) also argues explicitly for the
inclusion  of  a  ‘Southern  model’  of  social
policy  (1996:  4–7).  He  concentrates  on  four
dimensions of social security systems: the rules
of  access  (eligibility  rules),  the  conditions
under  which  benefits  are  granted,  the  regula-
tions to finance social protection and, finally,
the  organizational-managerial  arrangements
to  administrate  the  various  social  security
schemes. Based on these dimensions, he makes
a  distinction  between 
the  Scandinavian,
Anglo–Saxon,  Bismarckian  and  Southern
countries.  The  Scandinavian  countries  are
characterized  by  universal  coverage  for  the

risks  of  life.  The  right  to  social  protection  is
attributed  on  the  basis  of  citizenship.  The
Anglo–Saxon  family  of  welfare  states  is  also
characterized by a highly inclusive social secu-
rity  coverage,  but  only  in  the  area  of  health
care can one speak of fully universal risk cov-
erage. Also flat-rate benefits and means testing
play an important role. In the third group of
countries,  the  relationship  between  social
security entitlements, a person’s labour market
status and role within the family (breadwinner
or  not)  is  still  clearly  visible.  Contributions
play  an  important  role  in  financing  the
various schemes. Almost everybody has social
insurance  coverage  through  their  own  or
derived  rights.  Finally,  the  social  protection
systems of Southern countries are highly frag-
mented  and,  although  there  is  no  articulated
net of minimum social protection, some bene-
fits  levels  are  very  generous  (such  as  old  age
pensions). Moreover, in these countries health
care  is  institutionalized  as  a  right  of  citizen-
ship.  However,  in  general,  there  is  relatively
little  state  intervention  in  the  welfare  sphere.
Another important feature is the high level of
particularism with regard to cash benefits and
financing,  expressed  in  high  levels  of  clien-
telism.  The  most  important  features  of  each
type are summarized in Table 1.

Bonoli (1997) uses the Mediterranean coun-
tries  –  among  others  –  to  develop  the  final
classification  we  wish  to  discuss  in  this
section. He is especially critical of the decom-
modification  approach.  According  to  him,  it
does not allow one to discriminate effectively
between the Bismarckian and the Beveridgean
approaches to social policy. As an alternative,
he combines two approaches to the classifica-
tion  of  welfare  states.  One  concentrates  on 
the ‘how much’ dimension (emphasized in the
Anglo–Saxon literature) and the other on the
‘how’ dimension of social policy (emphasized
in  the  Continental-European  or  French  tradi-
tion).  As  an  empirical  indicator  of  the  first
dimension, he uses social expenditure as a pro-
portion of GDP, and of the second dimension
the  percentage  of  social  expenditure  financed
through  contributions.  These  indicators  lead

Arts and Gelissen

him  to  identify  four  types  of  countries:  the
British  countries,  the  Continental  European
countries,  the  Nordic  countries  and  the
Southern  countries,  thus  giving  credit  to  the
proposal of a ‘Southern model’.

Upon  examining  the  combined  arguments
of Leibfried, Ferrera and Bonoli, as presented
in Table 1, it appears that a strong similarity
exists among their first three types and those
of  Esping-Andersen.  However,  all 
three
authors add a fourth – Mediterranean – type
of welfare state regime to the original Esping-
Andersenian  classification.  Using  empirical
evidence,  they  argue  that  this  is  a  prototype
rather  than  a  subcategory  of  the  continental/
corporatist model.

The Antipodes

Esping-Andersen also discusses the Antipodean
countries (i.e. Australia and New Zealand) as
representatives  of  the  liberal  welfare  state
regime. This is because of their marginal com-
mitment to public welfare and strong reliance
on  means  testing.  However,  according  to
Castles  (1998),  Australia  and  New  Zealand
have  a  more  particular  and  a  more  inclusive
approach  to  social  protection  than  the  stan-
dard liberal form. Thresholds are set at com-
paratively  high  levels,  so  that  a  large  part  of
the  population  receives  some  means-tested
benefits.  The  result  is  that  the  Antipodes
exhibit the world’s most comprehensive systems
of  means-tested 
income  support  benefits.
Redistribution  has  been  traditionally  pursued
through wage controls and employment secu-
rity  rather  than  social  programmes.  Income
guarantees, realized by using market regulation
thus play an important role in the institutional
set-up of these welfare states. It therefore seems
that the Antipodean countries represent a sep-
arate  social  policy  model.  It  led  Castles  and
Mitchell  (1993)  to  question  whether  ‘social
spending  is  the  only  route  to  greater  income
redistribution’, implying that there may be other
ways than income maintenance by which states
may mitigate the effects of market forces.

Journal of European Social Policy 2002 12 (2)

for 

the  potential 

In  a  discussion  of  their  study,  Hill  (1996)
points out that Castles and Mitchell’s critique
of Esping-Andersen’s work essentially follows
two  lines.  In  the  first  place,  they  draw  atten-
tion to the fact that political activity from the
Left  may  have  been  introduced  into  those
countries  in  the  achievement  of  equality  in
pre-tax, pre-transfer income rather than in the
pursuit  of  equalization  through  social  policy.
Second,  they  argue  –  again  about  Australia
but  also  with  relevance  to  the  United  King-
dom – that the Esping-Andersen approach dis-
regards 
income-related
benefits  to  make  an  effective  contribution  to
redistribution. Australian income maintenance
is  almost  entirely  means-tested.  It  uses  an
approach that neither concentrates on a liberal-
type  redistribution  to  the  very  poor,  nor
resembles the more universal social-democratic
and  hierarchical 
solidaristic  conservative
ideal-types  highlighted  in  Esping-Andersen’s
study (Hill, 1996: 46). This is the reason why
Castles  and  Mitchell  develop  an  alternative,
four-way  classification  of  welfare  states:
Liberal,  Conservative,  Non-Right  Hegemony
and Radical. This utilizes the level of welfare
expenditure (i.e. household transfers as a per-
centage of GDP); average benefit equality; and
income  and  profit  taxes  as  a  percentage  of
GDP.

Other evidence for the exceptional position
of 
the  Antipodean  countries,  specifically
Australia,  is  found  when  countries  are  classi-
fied  according  to  the  typology  developed  by
Korpi  and  Palme  (1998).  This  is  based  on
institutional  characteristics  of  welfare  states.
They  try  to  investigate  the  causal  factors
which influence the institutional aspects of the
welfare state on the one hand, and the effects
of  institutions  on  the  formation  of  interests,
preferences  and  identities  –  as  well  as  on  the
degree of poverty and inequality in a society –
on  the  other  hand.  They  argue  that  institu-
tional structures can be expected to reflect the
role of conflicts among interest groups, while
they are also likely to form important frame-
works for the definitions of interests and iden-
tities  among  citizens.  They  can  thereby  be

expected  to  influence  coalition  formation,
which  is  significant  for  income  redistribution
and  poverty.  As  the  basis  of  their  classifica-
tion,  Korpi  and  Palme  take  the  institutional
structures of two social programmes – old age
pensions  and  sickness  cash  benefits  –  which
they consider to lie at the heart of the welfare
state.  The  institutional  structures  of  the  two
programmes  are  classified  according  to  three
aspects:  the  bases  of  entitlements,  the  princi-
ples  applied  to  determine  benefit  levels  (to
what  extent  social  insurance  should  replace
lost  income),  and  the  governance  of  a  social
insurance  programme  (whether  or  not  repre-
sentatives of employers and employees partici-
pate in the governing of a programme). Based
on  these  three  aspects,  they  discriminate
among  five  different  ideal-types  of  institu-
tional  structures:  the  targeted  (empirically
exemplified by the Australian case), voluntary
state  subsidized,  corporatist,  basic  security
and  encompassing  model.  In  Table  1,  these
ideal-types  and  their  most  important  features
are  delineated.  Again,  the  Esping-Andersen
model stands. However, a number of countries
are  no  longer  considered  to  belong  to  a  sub-
category of his three prototypes, but to a new
prototype.

Gender, familialism and late female
mobilization

By  explicitly  incorporating  gender,  several
authors  have  tried  to  reconceptualize  the
dimensions  of  welfare  state  variation.  Sub-
jecting  the  mainstream  welfare  state  typolo-
gies to an analysis of the differential places of
men and women within welfare states would,
according to them, produce valuable insights.
This does not mean, however, that the charac-
teristics  used  to  construct  the  typologies  are
exhaustive  (Sainsbury,  1996:  41).  Gender
analysis suggests that there are whole areas of
social  policy  that  Esping-Anderson  simply
misses. What seems to be particularly lacking
is a systematic discussion of the family’s place
in the provision of welfare and care. Not only

the state and the market provide welfare, but
also families. A further omission is that there
is no serious treatment of the degree to which
women  are  excluded  from  or  included  in  the
labour market.4 Instead of employing the all-
or-nothing  words  ‘inclusion’  and  ‘exclusion’
to  gender  differences,  it  seems  sensible  to
stress  the  importance  of  partial  citizenship
(Bulmer  and  Rees,  1996:  275).  Women
obtained full civil and political rights a consid-
erable  time  ago,  but  with  regard  to  social
rights,  women  are  still  discriminated  against,
sometimes  formally,  and  nearly  always  infor-
mally because of different labour market posi-
tions, 
to  different  gender  roles.
According to many feminist authors, it is the
sexual  division  of  paid  and  unpaid  work  –
especially  care  and  domestic  labour  –  that
needs  incorporating  in  the  typology  (Lewis,
1992;  O’Connor,  1993;  Orloff,  1993;
Sainsbury, 1996; O’Connor et al., 1999).

linked 

With  respect  to  another  issue,  social  care,
Daly and Lewis (2000: 289) argue that differ-
ent  styles  of  social  policy  have  incorporated
the key element of social care differently. They
identify  certain  tendencies  concerning  care  in
specific  welfare  states.  For  example,  the
Scandinavian  countries  form  a  distinct  group
in  that  they  have  strongly  institutionalized
care for both the elderly and children. In the
Mediterranean welfare states, care tends to be
privatized to the family whereas, in Germany,
it is seen as most appropriately a function of
voluntary  service  providers.  In  France,  a
strong  distinction  is  made  between  care  for
children and for the elderly, with a strong col-
lective sector in the former and little voluntary
involvement.  Another  form  is  found  in  the
Beveridge-oriented  welfare  states  –  Great
Britain  and  Ireland  –  where  a  strong  distinc-
tion is also made between caring for children
and caring for (elderly) adults. In the former –
as opposed to the latter – little collectivization
has  taken  place.  Although  they  do  not  really
classify  welfare  states  into  actual  clusters,
Daly and Lewis make a strong case for using
social  care  as  a  critical  dimension 
for
analysing variations.

Arts and Gelissen

As far as the gender gap in earnings is con-
cerned, Gornick and Jacobs (1998) found that
Esping-Andersen’s  regime-types  do  capture
important  distinctions  among  contemporary
welfare  states.  Their  results  showed  that 
the  size  of  the  public  sector,  the  extent  of 
the  public-sector  earnings  premium  and  the
impact of the public sector on gender differen-
tials  in  wages  all  varied  more  across  regimes
than  within  them.  In  this  way,  they  showed
the fruitfulness of emphasizing the gender per-
spective in Esping-Andersen’s classification of
welfare  states.  Moreover,  Trifiletti  (1999)
incorporated a gender perspective into Esping-
Andersen’s  classification  by  showing  that  a
systematic  relationship  exists  between  the
level  of  decommodification  and  whether  the
state treats women as wives and mothers or as
workers.  The  latter  is  also  an  important
dimension identified by Lewis (1989).

Finally,  Siaroff  (1994)  also  argues  that  the
existing literature does not pay enough atten-
tion to how gender inequality is embedded in
social  policy  and  welfare  states.  In  order  to
arrive  at  a  more  gender-sensitive  typology  of
welfare state regimes, he examines a variety of
indicators of gender equality and inequality in
work  and  welfare.  He  compares  the  work–
welfare  choice  of  men  and  women  (i.e.
whether  to  partake  in  the  welfare  state  or  to
engage  in  paid  labour)  across  countries.  This
allows him to distinguish among a Protestant
social-democratic,  a  Protestant  liberal,  an
Advanced  Christian-democratic  and  a  Late
Female  Mobilization  welfare  state  regime.
Although  the  labels  suggest  otherwise,  this
typology also shows a strong overlap with the
Esping-Andersenian  classification.  Only  the
latter  type  –  the  Late  Female  Mobilization
welfare  state  regime  –  is  an  addition,  which
resembles 
distinguished
Mediterranean type of welfare states.

the 

Ideal and real-types

In  Table  1,  we  ordered  the  types  discussed
above broadly in accordance with the worlds

Journal of European Social Policy 2002 12 (2)

of  welfare  capitalism  as  defined  by  Esping-
Andersen.  For  example,  Bonoli’s  Continental
type  is  very  much  like  Esping-Andersen’s
Conservative type; in both types contributions
play a rather important role. Equally, Castles
and  Mitchell’s  Non-Right  Hegemony  type
shows  a  large  amount  of  congruence  with
Esping-Andersen’s  Social-democratic 
type,
because of the high degree of universalism and
equalization in social policy. We could go on,
but we would like to raise another issue.

One  may  wonder  whether,  if  the  relation-
ship  among  the  different  typologies  is  as
strong  as  we  assume,  this  close  correspon-
dence  of  types  will  also  be  apparent  in  the
actual  clustering  of  countries.  Although  not
every classification developed by these authors
covers the same nations, there is a rather large
overlap which makes it possible to answer this
question. For that purpose, Table 2 shows the
extent  to  which  the  ideal-types  –  constructed
by  Esping-Andersen’s  critics  –  coincide  with
his own ideal-types. We then added the ideal-
types,  proposed  by  these  critics,  placing
related  ideal-types,  when  possible,  under  one
heading.  This  results  in  five  –  instead  of  the
original  three  –  worlds  of  welfare  capitalism
and  answers  our  original  question.  Next,  in
Table 2 we arranged the real-types according
to the different ideal-types, thereby following
the suggestions of the different authors.

It  appears  that,  even  when  one  uses  differ-
ent  indicators  to  classify  welfare  states,  some
countries  emerge  as  standard  examples,
approximating certain ideal-types. The United
States  is,  according  to  everyone’s  classifica-
tion,  the  prototype  of  a  welfare  state  which
can best be denoted as liberal (with or without
the  suffix:  Protestant,  Anglo–Saxon  or  basic
approaches 
security). 
the
Bismarckian/Continental/conservative 
ideal-
type  and  Sweden  approximates  the  social-
democratic ideal-type (Scandinavian/Nordic).
However, consensus seems to end here. For
example, according to some, Italy can best be
assigned  to  the  second,  corporatist/continen-
tal/conservative  type,  but  belongs,  according
to  others,  along  with  Greece,  Spain  and

Portugal  to  a  distinctive  Mediterranean  type.
The  same  holds  for  Australia  which  may
either  be  classified  as  liberal  or  is  the  proto-
type  of  a  separate,  radical  welfare  state.
Nevertheless,  as  far  as  these  countries  and
types  are  concerned,  consensus  is  stronger
than  was 
initially  assumed.  One  must,
however, recognize that discussions are mainly
concerned  with  whether  certain  types  of
welfare states are either separate categories or
are subgroups of certain main types.

Hybrid  cases  are  a  bigger  problem.  The
Netherlands  and  Switzerland  are  clear  exam-
ples of this. If we take, for example, a closer
look  at  the  Dutch  case,  we  see  that  Esping-
Andersen

Netherlands  to  the  social-democratic  type,
whereas  Korpi  and  Palme  see  it  as  liberally
oriented;  the  basic  security  type.  However,
most  authors  place  the  Netherlands  in  the
second  category  of  corporatist/continental/
conservative  welfare  states.  This  is  also  the
choice  of  Visser  and  Hemerijck  (1997),
perhaps the foremost specialists on the Dutch
welfare  state.  Curiously  enough,  this  is  done
using  Esping-Andersen’s  work  as  a  constant,
positive reference. If we have another look at
Esping-Andersen’s work, this is not as surpris-
ing  as  one  would  expect.  It  is  true  that  the
Netherlands is rated relatively high on social-
democratic characteristics, but not exception-
ally 
conservative
characteristics. Recently, Esping-Andersen has
called  the  Netherlands  the  ‘Dutch  enigma’
because  of  its  Janus-faced  welfare  regime
(1999: 88). The Netherlands is indeed more a
hybrid  case  than  a  prototype  of  a  specific
ideal-type. If one attaches more importance to
certain  attributes  than  to  others  –  and  adds
other  characteristics  or  substitutes  previous
ones – then it is easy to arrive at different clas-
sifications.

Empirical robustness of the three-way
classification

Esping-Andersen  claims  that  if  we  rate  real

welfare states along the dimensions of degree
of decommodification and the modes of strati-
fication,  three  qualitatively  different  clusters
will  appear.  Alongside  the  more  fundamental
criticism of his three-way classification – that
Esping-Andersen  employs  faulty  criteria  to
demarcate  a  regime  –  the  empirical  fit  of  his
three-way  classification  has  also  been  ques-
tioned.  Several  authors  have  tested  the  good-
ness-of-fit  of  the  three-way  regime  typology.
In  the  following,  we  discuss  their  findings,
which are presented in Table 3.

In  an  effort  to  evaluate  the  possible  extent
to  which  quantitative  techniques  –  OLS
regression  and  cluster-analysis  –  suggest  the
same  conclusions  as  alternative  qualitative
approaches  –  such  as  ‘BOOLEAN’  compara-
tive  analysis  –  Kangas  (1994)  found  some
support for the existence of Esping-Andersen’s
different  welfare  state  regimes.  Specifically,
cluster-analyses  of  data  on  characteristics  of
health  insurance  schemes  in  OECD  countries
in  1950  and  1985  corroborated  his  conjec-
tures.  However,  the  results  also  showed  the
existence  of  two  subgroups  within  the  group

Ragin (1994) also tested Esping-Andersen’s
claim of a three-world classification. By apply-
ing  a  combination  of  cluster-analysis  and
‘BOOLEAN’  comparative  analysis  to  charac-
teristics  of  pension  systems,  he  determined
which,  if  any,  of  Esping-Andersen’s  three
worlds  of  welfare  capitalism  each  country
fitted  best.  His  cluster  analysis  suggested  the
existence of a social-democratic cluster, a cor-
poratist  cluster  and,  finally,  a  rather  large
‘spare’ cluster, which accommodates cases that
do  not  conform  to  Esping-Andersen’s  three
worlds.  On  the  basis  of  his  findings,  Ragin
concludes  that  the  three-worlds  scheme  does
not capture existing diversity as adequately as
one would wish.

Shalev (1996) applied factor analysis to 14
pension policy indicators collected by Esping-
Andersen,  to  test  for  the  presence  of  liberal,
social-democratic  and  corporatist  regime-

types.  This  factor  analysis  showed  that  the
intercorrelations  among  these  social  policy
indicators were dependent on two dimensions.
The  first  factor  measured  the  level  of  social-
democratic 
the  second
dimension  measured  corporatist  features  of
welfare  states.  Based  on  the  assignment  of
factor  scores  to  individual  nations,  Shalev
concluded that his findings were in close cor-
respondence  with  Esping-Andersen’s  charac-
terizations  of  the  three  welfare  state  regimes.
He admitted, however, that some countries are
difficult to classify.

Using cluster-analysis, Obinger and Wagschal
(1998)  tested  Esping-Andersen’s  classification
of  welfare  state  regimes  using  the  stratifica-
tion-criterion.  After  a  detailed  re-analysis  of
Esping-Andersen’s  original  data  on  stratifica-
tion,  they  concluded  that  these  data  are  best
described  by  five  regime-clusters.  In  addition
to Esping-Andersen’s conservative, liberal and
social-democratic  types,  they  distinguish  a
radical and a hybrid European cluster.

The most recent attempt to empirically cor-
roborate  Esping-Andersen’s  classification  has
been  undertaken  by  Wildeboer  Schut  et  al.
(2001).  This  study  examined  the  actual  simi-
larities  and  differences  among  the  welfare
state  regimes  of  the  countries  originally
included  in  Esping-Andersen’s  classification.
For  these  countries,  58  characteristics  of  the
labour  market,  tax  regime  and  social  protec-
tion system at the beginning of the 1990s were
collected.  These  were  submitted  to  a  non-
linear  principal  component-analysis.  The
results  largely  confirmed  the  three-regime
typology of Esping-Andersen.

typology  neither  passes 

Summing  up,  Esping-Andersen’s  original
three-worlds 
the
empirical  tests  with  flying  colours,  nor  dis-
mally fails them. The conclusion is, first, that
his  typology  has  at  least  some  heuristic  and
descriptive  value,  but  also  that  a  case  can  be
made  for  extending  the  number  of  welfare
state  regimes  to  four,  or  even  five.  Second,
these analyses show that a significant number
of  welfare  states  must  be  considered  hybrid
cases:  no  particular  case  can  ever  perfectly

embody  any  particular  ideal-type  (Goodin  et
al.,  1999:  56).  Third,  if  one  looks  at  other
social  programmes  than  the  ones  applied  by
Esping-Andersen,  it  becomes  clear  that  they
do  not  conform  so  easily  –  if  at  all  –  to  his
welfare regime patterns (Gough, 2000a: 4).

Conclusion and discussion

Before  we  reach  our  conclusions,  let  us
examine  how  Esping-Andersen  himself  has
reacted  to  the  various  attempts  to  amend  his
typology.  The  problem  is  that  after  consider-
able discussion it seems impossible for him to
make  up  his  mind  once  and  for  all.  Initially,
Esping-Andersen (1997) reacted, for example,
positively  to  Castles  and  Mitchell’s  proposal
to add a fourth type – a radical welfare state
regime  –  to  his  typology.  He  recognized  that
the  residual  character  and  the  matter  of  a
means test are just one side of the coin of the
Antipodean  welfare  states.  However,  he  felt
that  a  powerfully  institutionalized  collection
of welfare guarantees, which operate through
the market itself, could not be neglected. Later
on,  however,  he  argued  that  the  passage  of
time  is  pushing  Australia,  Great  Britain  and
New  Zealand  towards  what  appears  to  be
prototypical 
(Esping-Andersen,
1999). At first he also partially supported the
proposal  to  add  a  separate  Mediterranean
type to his typology (Esping-Andersen, 1996:
66; 1997: 171). He acknowledged the – some-
times  generous  –  benefits  which  are  guaran-
teed by certain arrangements, the near absence
of social services and, especially, the Catholic
imprint  and  high  level  of  familialism.  From
the feminist critics he learned not so much the
overarching salience of gender as the analyti-
cal power that a re-examination of the family
can yield. Recently he argued that the acid test
of a distinct Mediterranean model depends on
whether  families  are  the  relevant  focus  of
social  aid,  and  whether  families  will  fail  just
as  markets  and  states  can  fail  (Esping-
Andersen, 1999: 90).

liberalism 

All in all, Esping-Andersen is very reluctant

154

Arts and Gelissen

to  add  more  regime-clusters  to  his  original
three.  Against  the  benefits  of  greater  refine-
ment,  more  nuance  and  more  precision,  he
weighs the argument of analytical parsimony,
stressing  that  ‘the  peculiarities  of  these  cases
are  variations  within  a  distinct  overall  logic,
not  a  wholly  different  logic  per  se’  (Esping-
Andersen, 1999: 90).

The  answer  to  the  question  of  whether
Esping-Andersen’s  three-type  or  a  derivative
or  alternative  four,  or  five-type  typology  is
preferable depends, however, not only on par-
simony and verisimilitude. It also depends on
whether  these  typologies  lead  to  a  theoreti-
cally  more  satisfying  and  empirically  more
fruitful  comparative  analysis  of  welfare  state
regimes. As far as theory construction is con-
cerned,  Baldwin  (1996:  29)  has  argued  that
when  asking  about  typologies,  whether  of
welfare  states  or  anything  else,  we  must  ask
not just what but also why. Esping-Andersen’s
tentative answer to the question of why three
different  welfare  state  regime  types  emerged
has  been  sketched  earlier  on  in  this  paper.
Different welfare regimes are shaped by differ-
ent class coalitions within a context of inher-
ited institutions. This answer is embedded in a
power-resources  mobilization  paradigm.  The
tentative  answer  to  the  question  of  why
regime shifts are scarce is that a national state
cannot easily escape its historical inheritance.
Institutional inertia is one factor why different
welfare  state  regime  types  persist,  and  path
dependency  is  another  (Kohl,  2000:  125;
Kuhnle  and  Alestalo,  2000:  9).  Korpi  and
Palme – and some feminist authors – work in
the  same  power-resources  mobilization  tradi-
tion  as  Esping-Andersen.  It  would  be  worth-
while  to  develop  a  theoretical  reconstruction
of the different contributions of this paradigm
(for  an  initial  impetus  to  such  an  endeavour,
see Schmidt, 1998: 215–28). Only then could
the explanatory value of the typology become
apparent.

Whether there is, within the welfare model-
ling  business,  an  alternative  available  to

theory  is  difficult  to  determine.  The  work  of
some of the other authors we discussed in this
overview  has  a  strong  empiricist  flavour.
However,  if  we  are  searching  for  an  underly-
ing  theoretical  notion,  it  can  be  found  in  the
rather  general  statement  that  similar  causes
have  similar  consequences.  Considering  the
labels these authors have put to the prototypes
they  distinguish,  which  are  predominantly
geographical  and  ideological  in  nature,  the
most important causes are seen to be the pres-
sure of functional exigencies and the diffusion
of  innovations  (Goldthorpe,  2000:  54).  The
first  factor  could  be  translated  into  a  ‘chal-
lenge  response’  hypothesis.  The  challenges
produced by the force of similar circumstances
(characteristics  of  pre-industrial  social  struc-
tures,  political  institutions,  degree  of  homo-
geneity  of  population,  culture,  problem
perceptions and preferences) lead to compara-
ble  welfare  state  regimes  (responses)  (Kuhnle
and  Alestalo,  2000:  7).  The  second  factor
could  be  put  in  terms  of  learning  effects  in
policy  making.  New  ideas,  new  solutions  are
often  a  product  of  a  diffusion  process.  They
hit  political  systems  and  societies  at  different
points  in  ‘developmental  time’.  As  far  as  this
latter  factor  is  concerned,  Boje  (1996:  15)
argues  that  the  fact  that  most  welfare  states
are confronted with huge social problems has
necessitated  politicians 
finding  alternative
procedures,  which  may  solve  these  problems
more  efficiently.  Politicians  have  come  to
realize  that  much  may  be  learned  from  other
welfare states.

Castles  (1993;  1998)  too  underscores  the
importance of both factors. He argues that it
is likely that policy similarities and differences
among welfare states can be attributed to both
the force of circumstances and to diffusion. As
far as the latter factor is concerned we can dis-
tinguish  the  institutional  arrangements  and
culture of prototypical welfare states and their
transmission and diffusion to other countries.
Regarding  the  former  factor,  we  can  observe
the  immediate  impact  of  economic,  political
and  social  variables  identified  in  the  contem-
porary public policy literature. Whether these

very  general  ‘challenge  response’  and  ‘diffu-
sion’  hypotheses  will  be  further  developed
remains  to  be  seen.  For  the  moment,  we  can
conclude  that,  given  the  empiricist  nature  of
the work of the authors who provided alterna-
tive  typologies,  there  should  be  hardly  any
objection – for the time being – to the incor-
poration  of  their  findings  into  a  power–
resources mobilization paradigm.

the 

typology. 

Finally,  we  arrive  at  the  empirical  fruitful-
ness  of 
In  his  overview,
Abrahamson  (1999)  concludes  that  as  an
organizing  principle  for  comparative  studies
of welfare states the typologies have proven to
be a very robust and convincing tool. Within
the  power–resources  mobilization  paradigm
(Korpi,  1983;  Esping-Andersen  and  Korpi,
1984;  Esping-Andersen,  1990)  it  has  been
proposed  that  the  nature  of  the  welfare  state
regime would decisively influence support for
certain  forms  of  social  policy.  A  type  that  is
characterized by universalism would generate
the  strongest  support,  whereas  arrangements
which  apply  only  to  minorities  would  not
succeed in winning the support of majorities.
Tests of this hypothesis (Papadakis and Bean,
1993; Peillon, 1996; Gelissen, 2000; Gevers et
al., 2000) have shown some empirical support,
but  the  evidence  is  not  really  encouraging.
More encouraging were the results of an effort
(Gundelach,  1994)  to  explain  cross-national
differences  in  values  with  respect  to  welfare
and care using the Esping-Andersenian welfare
state regimes. Also, Svallfors’s (1997) and Arts
and  Gelissen’s  (2001)  tests  of  the  hypothesis
that different welfare state regimes matter for
people’s  attitudes  towards  income-redistribu-
tion, were strongly endorsed. What especially
matters to us here is that Svallfors distributive
justice  and  solidarity  had  included  not  only
Esping-Andersen’s 
regime-types,  but  also
other types and Arts and Gelissen.

It  is  more  difficult  to  draw  a  conclusion
concerning  the  influence  that  welfare  state
regimes  have  on  social  behaviour  and  their
effects. Much of this research has a bearing on
the distributive effects of welfare state regimes.
Because  they  are  often  described  in  terms  of

their intended social stratification, a tautologi-
cal  element  easily  sneaks  into  the  explana-
tions.  Positive  exceptions  are  Goodin  et  al.
(1999)  and  Korpi  and  Palme  (1998).  Using
panel-data,  Goodin  et  al.  (1999)  show  that
welfare  state  regimes  do  not  only  have
intended results, but also generate unintended
consequences.  As  intended  and  expected,  the
social-democratic regime succeeds best in real-
izing its fundamental value: minimizing inequal-
ity. But this regime is also at least as good in
promoting  the  goals  to  which  other  regimes
ostensibly attach most importance. Specifically,
the  social-democratic  regime  also  does  very
well in reducing poverty – a goal which is pri-
oritized  by  the  liberal  welfare  state  regime  –
and in promoting stability and social integra-
tion, which is the home ground of the corpo-
ratist  welfare  state  regime.  Korpi  and  Palme
(1998)  find  that  institutional  differences  lead
to a paradox of redistribution: the more bene-
fits are targeted at the poor and the more the
creation of equality through equal public trans-
fers to all is a matter of priority, the less poverty
and  equality  will  be  reduced.  Thus,  institu-
tional  arrangements  characteristic  of  certain
welfare state regimes not only have unintended
consequences, but even perverse effects.

All  in  all,  these  conclusions  provide  suffi-
cient impetus to continue the work concerning
the  resulting  welfare  state  typology.  A  better
formulation of the theory on which it is based
deserves priority. Only then can predictions be
logically  –  instead  of  impressionistically  –
deduced from theory. Only then is a strict test
of  the  theory  possible  and  only  then  will 
the  heuristic  and  explanatory  value  of  the
typology become apparent.

3 For  reasons  of  conciseness  we  refrain  from  the
debate  regarding  Esping-Andersen’s  classifica-
tion  of  Japan  as  a  liberal  welfare  state.  For  a
reaction  to  this  critique  see  Esping-Andersen
(1997; 1999). Becker (1996) and Goodman and
Peng (1996) are even of the opinion that Japan
belongs  to  a  sixth  prototype  of  welfare  state
regimes,  the  so-called  East-Asian  welfare  states.
We  acknowledge  the  importance  of  these  argu-
ments,  but  cannot  engage  with  them  here
(Gough, 2000a; 2000b).

4 Gornick  and  Jacobs  (1998:  691)  point  out  that
Esping-Andersen  himself  argues 
that  each
regime-type is associated with women’s employ-
ment  levels.  Specifically,  he  (Esping-Andersen,
1990)  expects  that  women’s  employment  rates
will  be  highest  in  social-democratic  countries,
whereas in liberal welfare states, moderate levels
of female employment will be found. The lowest
levels  of  women’s  employment  will  be  found  in
the conservative welfare states.
