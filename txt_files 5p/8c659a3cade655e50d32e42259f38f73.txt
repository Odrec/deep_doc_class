The Leverage Ratchet Effect 

Abstract 

Shareholder-creditor conflicts can create leverage ratchet effects, resulting in inefficient 
capital  structures.  Once  debt  is  in  place,  shareholders  may  inefficiently  increase  leverage  but 
avoid reducing it no matter how beneficial leverage reduction might be to total firm value.  

We  present  conditions  for  an  irrelevance  result  under  which  shareholders  view  asset 
sales, pure recapitalization and asset expansion with new equity as equally undesirable. We then 
analyze  how  seniority,  asset  heterogeneity,  and  asymmetric  information  affect  shareholders’ 
choice of leverage-reduction method.  

Our results are particularly relevant to banking and highlight the benefit and importance 

of capital regulation to constrain inefficient excessive borrowing.

1. Introduction 

Firms  in  financial  distress  can  alleviate  their  distress  (assuming  they  are  solvent)  by 

buying back their debt with funds raised through some combination of new share issuance, assets 

sales, and retained earnings. Yet shareholders often resist such actions and might instead look for 

additional funding by borrowing, thus increasing their leverage. Firms also tend to increase their 

leverage in response to changes in the tax code that make borrowing more attractive, but fail to 

reduce  leverage  when  the  tax  advantage  of  debt  over  equity  is  reduced.1  Shareholders,  and 

managers acting to raise shareholder value, consider reducing leverage to be “expensive.” 

In this paper we show that conflicts of interest between shareholders and creditors can 

explain all these observations. Whereas it is well known that such conflicts can lead to inefficient 

investment decisions, our analysis focuses instead on the agency cost associated with inefficient 

capital structure choices that result from high leverage. We identify a ratchet effect that drives 

shareholders  to  favor  leverage  increases  even  when  increases  reduce  firm  value  and  to  resist 

leverage reductions even when they increase firm value. In other words, leverage begets more 

leverage,  and  can  become  “addictive.”  This  ratchet  effect  exacerbates  the  inefficiencies  often 

attributed  to  high  leverage,  namely  underinvestment  and  excessive  risk  taking  (asset 

substitution).  

We show that the effects that existing leverage have on future funding choices are related 

to, but distinct from, the agency costs of debt that are associated with distortions of investment 

decisions. The agency costs we study concern the funding side and arise even in a context where 

investments  are  fixed.  Resistance

to 

leverage  reduction  bears  similarity 

to 

the 

1 

underinvestment  problem  typically  referred  to  as  debt  overhang  (Myers,  1977),  where  a 

beneficial  action  is  not  taken  because  it  benefits  existing  creditors  at  shareholders’  expense. 

Inefficient  increases  in  leverage  resemble  risk-shifting  problems,  where  shareholders  take  an 

action for their own benefit that harms existing creditors.  

Our analysis assumes that creditors are small and dispersed so that conflicts of interest 

cannot  be  dealt  with  by  collective  bargaining.  Although  the  terms  of  existing  debt  cannot  be 

renegotiated, the debt can be bought back in the open market. In such a buyback, each creditor 

can choose whether to sell his claims back to the firm or hold on to them. The price at which 

debt is repurchased must therefore reflect the value of the option of holding on to the debt. This 

value will be greater than the pre-buyback value of the debt if the leverage reduction reduces the 

borrower’s default probability.2  

  

We  show  that  the  resistance  of  shareholders  (or  managers  working  on  their  behalf)  to 

reducing  the  firm’s  leverage  once  debt  is  in  place  applies  to  any  and  all  forms  of  leverage 

reduction. In particular, shareholders will resist leverage reduction even if it does not involve the 

sale of new shares in the open market but is achieved, for example, selling assets to buy back 

debt or by retaining earnings.  

Asset substitution and underinvestment can lower the total value of the firm. The leverage 

ratchet  can  also  lower  the  value  of  the  firm  since  it  induces  an  inefficient  capital  structure. 

However,  in  sharp  contrast  to  the  underinvestment  problem,  which  only  occurs  when  the  net 
                                                 
2 Such effects are well known from the literature concerning market-based solutions to the sovereign debt 
crisis of the 1980s. See e.g. the contributions in Frenkel et al. (1989) and Bulow and Rogoff (1990).) The 
theory developed in that literature was confirmed in the Bolivian debt buyback of 1988 and more recently 
the Greek debt buyback of 2012. By contrast, van Wijnbergen (1991) showed that, in the 1990 buyback of 
Mexican debt under the Brady plan, which involved collective bargaining, creditors were forced to agree 
to terms under which they neither gained nor lost from the buyback. The importance of the difference 
between  collective  bargaining  and  unilateral  actions  of  the  debtor  is  also  stressed  by  Strebulaev  and 
Whited (2012). However, they do not consider buybacks in markets, but study callable debt, where the 
call option requires a repayment of the amount that was originally borrowed, plus a premium.   

2 

present  value  of  the  project  is  not  large  enough  for  the  shareholders’  share  of  the  benefits  to 

cover its cost, shareholders’ resistance to leverage reductions can persist no matter how much 

leverage reduction would increase the total value of the firm. The reason is that shareholders do 

not capture any benefit brought about by leverage reduction. Hence, the conflict can be extreme.  

The leverage ratchet is particularly strong for highly leveraged firms, such as banks. It is 

therefore critical to understanding the capital structure choices of financial institutions that obtain 

most of their funding from debt. If their debts are implicitly guaranteed, banks’ creditors have 

fewer incentives to put in place debt covenants that might mitigate the leverage ratchet. Leverage 

choices can therefore become extremely inefficient, especially since banks have many ways to 

issue debt that is effectively more senior to prior claims (e.g., because it has shorter maturity or is 

backed by collateral). Moreover, banks’ distress or default can have significant negative external 

effects. Since the market fails to correct the social inefficiency, effective regulation is essential to 

correct the resulting distortions.  

There  are  three  distinct  ways  that  shareholders  can  reduce  leverage  in  order  to  meet 

covenant restrictions or regulations: (i) pure recapitalization, which involves issuing equity (via a 

market offering or a rights issue) and using the proceeds to buy back debt without any change in 

(operating) assets, (ii) “deleveraging” which involves selling assets to generate the proceeds used 

to buy back debt, and (iii) asset expansion in which the proceeds of a new equity issuance are 

used to acquire new assets.3  We examine shareholder incentives to choose one of these ways 

over the others. 

                                                 
3 The requirements specified in Basel II and Basel III are based primarily on the ratio of equity to risk-weighted 
assets, rather than the ratio equity to total assets, the so called “leverage ratio.” We abstract from risk weights in 
much of our analysis by assuming that assets are homogenous.  The general case of non-homogeneous assets and the 
effect of risk weights are discussed in Section 4.2.3.   

3 

In comparing these three modes of leverage reduction, we obtain a striking irrelevance 

result: If there is one class of debt outstanding, assets are homogeneous, and sales or purchases 

of assets do not, by themselves, generate value for shareholders, then shareholders are indifferent 

between asset sales, pure recapitalization and asset expansion. All are equally undesirable from 

the perspective of shareholders.  

We  then  examine  a  number  of  factors  that  influence  shareholders’  choice  of  how  to 

reduce  leverage  when  the  conditions  of  the  irrelevance  results  do  not  hold.  For  example,  we 

show that when there are multiple classes of debt and in the absence of covenants that prevent it, 

shareholders will buy back the most junior debt before repurchasing debt with higher priority. 

When shareholders have the ability to buy back junior debt in this way, they will tend to prefer 

deleveraging  through  asset  sales  over  the  other  two  approaches.    We  discuss  how  transaction 

costs and asymmetric information can potentially make each of the other modes preferable from 

the shareholders’ perspective. 

The ratchet effect we identify is related to the concept of debt overhang in Myers (1977). 

Myers showed that when debt is in place, shareholders may avoid taking valuable projects that 

they would have undertaken in the absence of debt. This underinvestment can occur when the 

shareholders bear the full costs of any project the firm undertakes, but the benefits are shared 

with existing creditors. Our analysis shows that a similar conflict of interest arises in shareholder 

attitudes towards reducing leverage. However, as mentioned above, unlike the underinvestment 

problem which is resolved when the benefits of investing are large enough, the leverage ratchet 

problem persists no matter how large are the benefits of reducing leverage.   

4 

Resistance to raising new equity is often explained by alluding to asymmetric information 

along  the  lines  of  Myers  and  Majluf  (1984).4  The  Myers-Majluf  analysis,  however,  is  strictly 

limited to situations in which the firm issues new shares to raise equity and is based solely on the 

dilution  that  occurs  when  the  market  undervalues  the  firm’s  shares  due  to  asymmetric 

information. The Myers-Majluf effect cannot in any way explain shareholders’ unwillingness to 

reduce leverage in ways that do not involve the issuance of common shares, e.g., through rights 

offerings  or  retaining  earnings,  since  neither  of  these  involve  a  loss  due  to  the  market 

undervaluing shares.  The behavior of heavily indebted firms such as banks, which often make 

payouts  to  shareholders  and  avoid  making  rights  offerings,  is  much  more  consistent  with  the 

ratchet effect that we discuss here than with problems related to asymmetric information   

Asymmetric  information  also  cannot  explain  the  universal  resistance  to  increases  in 

equity requirements in the banking industry. If leverage reductions are imposed by regulation, 

there is not much room for adverse selection. Any “dilution costs” for the shareholders of firms 

with above-average return prospects should be matched by benefits for the shareholders of firms 

with below-average return prospects. Yet all banks resist higher equity requirements. 

In another paper (Admati et al. 2013) we consider banks’ total funding costs and argue 

that there are essentially no social costs to having significantly less leverage in banking, because 

the benefits to banks from high leverage are only due to debt subsidies, which come at taxpayers’ 

expense  despite  the  fact  that  high  leverage  increases  the  fragility  of  the  financial  system  and 

makes for inefficient investment decisions due to the agency costs of debt. The current paper, in 

contrast  to  Admati  et  al.  (2013),  considers  leverage  decisions  from  the  perspective  of 

shareholders and managers in the already-indebted firm.  

                                                 
4 See for example Bolton and Freixas (2006), Kashyap, Hansen, and Stein (2010).

The  resistance  of  shareholders  to  leverage  reduction  due  to  conflicts  between 

shareholders  and  creditors  does  not  rely  on  frictions  created  by  government  policies,  and  is 

present even under the “no friction” assumptions of the Modigliani-Miller (1958) irrelevance 

result. We do show that the effect is exacerbated by debt subsidies and, as discussed above, by 

explicit  and  especially  implicit  debt  guarantees.  The  results  of  this  paper  strengthen  our 

conclusion that in the context of banking effective capital regulation is essential and have other 

implications for both the transition to higher equity requirements and to its ongoing practice.  

In theoretical and empirical studies of capital structure, the standard assumption is that 

firms  act  to  maximize  their  total  value.  Although  it  is  widely  recognized  that  the  interests  of 

shareholders  are  no  longer  consistent  with  maximizing  the  total  value  of  the  firm,  this 

observation is almost exclusively applied to investment decisions once debt is in place, and it has 

not been carefully explored, as we do here, with respect to funding decisions.  

In  the  literature  on  dynamic  capital  structure,  it  is  common  to  explore  shareholders’ 

decisions with respect to payouts and default without allowing changes in the capital structure 

(prior  to  default).    Papers  that  allow  adjustments  in  capital  structure  often  assume  that  it  is 

prohibitively costly to reduce leverage in distress, or that debt can only be recalled at par or at a 

premium.5 By contrast, our analysis realistically allows debt to be bought back in the market at 

competitive prices.6 In addition, we allow funds to be raised by selling assets or issuing equity 

through common share or rights offerings. Unlike much of the literature, our key results do not 

depend on any assumptions about exogenous transactions costs.  

                                                 
5 For discussion and references to the literature, see Strebulaev and Whited (2012).  
6  Some  papers  make  the  assumption  that  new  debt  can  be  issued  pari  passu  with  existing  debt,  which  can  help 
overcome the underinvestment problem identified in Myers (1977). Unless existing creditors benefit from additional 
investments, issuing such debt can reduce the value of existing creditors and violates their seniority. In the spirit of 
Myers (1977), we assume for most of our analysis that violating the seniority of existing creditors is not possible.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the basic model. Section 3 analyzes 

pure recapitalization as viewed from shareholders’ perspective and derives the key ratchet effect 

of leverage. In Section 4 we consider alternative ways for a firm to reduce leverage other than 

pure recapitalization. Section 5 discusses the application of our analysis to banking and the role 

of capital regulation. Section 6 provides concluding remarks.  

2. The Basic Model 

We consider a firm that has made an investment in risky assets and has funded itself with 
debt. To explain our results in the simplest possible terms, we begin with a simple and standard 
“tradeoff” model of capital structure, which we will generalize later as we examine additional 
frictions.  For our basic argument, we make the following assumptions: 

Firm Investment:  The firm has made a real investment  A  in the past (“date 0”). Investment 

returns are realized at date 2 and are given by a random variable  xA .  

Firm Liabilities:   We assume that the firm is funded by equity, and a total debt claim of D 
against the firm that is due at date 2, the date at which the asset return of 
xA

xA D , debt claims are honored in full.  

 is realized. If 

We begin by considering three “frictions” that affect the payouts of the firm’s securities 

at date 2. These are taxes, bankruptcy costs, and third party (government) subsidies.  

Taxes:  



We assume that a tax may be applied to those returns earned on the firm’s 
assets  that  exceed  what  is  paid  to  the  debt  holders.  The  tax  is  given  by

example, if debt plays a “disciplining role” as in Jensen (1986) or we can think of t as capturing any losses resulting 
from  a  lack  of  discipline.    Alternatively,  there  may  be  ex  ante  costs  to  equity  associated  with  leverage,  such  as 
increased wages as in Berk, Stanton, and Zechner (2010).  The key assumption is that on the margin, tax shields and 
disciplining benefits, net of any costs, are weakly increasing in D.

8 The existence of such a distribution (or pricing kernel) F follows from the absence of arbitrage opportunities. We 
assume the firm acts as a price-taker with respect to this pricing kernel. Thus, as is standard in the corporate finance 
literature, we are ignoring any general equilibrium consequences of the individual firm’s security choices on the 
equilibrium pricing kernel.

3. Debt Overhang and Recapitalization 

In this section, we assume that the real investments of the firm, which were made in date 
0,  are  fixed  and  will  not  be  changed.  We  examine  the  effects  of  reducing  the  firms’  leverage 
through a pure recapitalization that involves the firm issuing new equity and buying back some 
of its debt. We assume that the debt must be bought back at the prevailing market price. Because 
debt holders are free to choose between selling the debt securities and keeping them, the market 
price must be such that, at the margin, debt holders are indifferent.  We also assume that new 
equity will be issued at the market price, reflecting the post-recapitalization value of a share.9  

In  Section  3.1  we  show  that  incumbent  shareholders  are  made  worse  off  by  a 
recapitalization that reduces leverage, and thus they would not voluntarily choose to engage in it. 
While it is perhaps not surprising that debt overhang can create a cost to shareholders associated 
with a recapitalization, we demonstrate that the resistance to leverage reduction is much more 
powerful  than  the  underinvestment  identified  by  Myers  (1977)  in  that  it  is  universal: 
shareholders  will  resist  a  recapitalization  that  involves  repurchasing  risky  debt  no  matter  how 
little  the  leverage  the  firm  currently  has,  and  no  matter  how  large  the  benefit  is  in  terms  of 
reduced default costs.   

In Section 3.2, we generalize our model to consider additional costs of leverage stemming 
from  shareholder-debt  holder  conflicts.    Specifically,  we  consider  the  possibility  of  asset 
substitution (risk-shifting) and future underinvestment.  These costs raise the potential benefits to 
the firm from reducing leverage.  Nonetheless, we show that no matter how large these costs are, 
and  how  over-leveraged  the  firm  currently  is,  shareholders  will  still  resist  any  attempt  to 
recapitalize  the  firm  in  order  to  reduce  these  costs.  Indeed,  their  resistance  is  stronger  if  the 
leverage reduction reduces future incentives for asset substitution and underinvestment.  

Thus, we can think of shareholder resistance to value-enhancing leverage reductions as an 
additional agency cost associated with debt overhang that lowers the ex ante value of the firm. 
The resulting dynamics of capital structure choices have a ratchet effect, where once leverage is 
in place, shareholders frequently have incentives to increase it when permitted to do so, but will 
resist  decreasing  it  unless  forced  to  do  so,  since  decreases  transfer  wealth  from  them  to 

                                                 
9 Of course, the issuance and buyback prices may also be affected by transactions costs and asymmetric information, 
which we consider in Section 4.

incumbent debt holders.  The ratchet effect effectively creates an “addiction” to leverage which 
we formalize in Section 3.3. As a result, regulation that forces recapitalization can actually serve 
as a commitment device that can increase the ex-ante value of the firm.  

 

3.1 The Impact of Recapitalization on Shareholders 

We begin by assuming that the firm has issued at time 0 a single class of debt with face 
value D. Equation (1) above implies that the current market price of debt per unit of nominal face 
value is equal to:

Suppose that, at date 1, the firm considers buying back debt with a nominal claim equal to

the firm wants to buy back debt in the open market, it cannot do so at the price given in (3). The

question is unambiguously negative. 

Proposition 1 (Shareholder resistance to Recapitalization): Equity holders are strictly worse 
off issuing securities to recapitalize the firm and reduce its outstanding debt. The loss to equity 
holders  is  mitigated  by  bankruptcy  costs,  and  increased  by  the  presence  of  taxes  or  default 
subsidies.    
                                                 
10 For extensive discussions of this point, see Frenkel et al. (1989) and Bulow and Rogoff (1990). 
11 Recall that we are assuming that security values are determined by the pricing kernel F , which is unaffected by 
the firm’s leverage. Thus the impact on investor wealth is sufficient to determine shareholder preferences.

therefore establishes that a debt repurchase is unattractive to shareholders even if the firm is able 
to  repurchase  the  least  expensive  debt  claims  when  multiple  claims  exits.  This  gives  us  the 
following important generalization: 

A   Since 
).

q D
(

 

,

Proposition  2  (Shareholder  Resistance  to  any  debt  buybacks):  Equity  holders  are  strictly 
worse  off  issuing  securities  to  recapitalize  the  firm  by  repurchasing  any  class  of  outstanding 
debt.   
 

Propositions 1 and 2 refer to the preferences of equity holders. When default is costly to 
the firm, the interests of equity holders will be in conflict with maximization of total firm value. 
For  example,  if  taxes  and  subsidies  are  zero  while  bankruptcy  costs  are  not,  then  a 
recapitalization and buyback of risky debt raises the value of the firm  (i.e. the combined wealth 
of  shareholders  and  debt  holders  jointly).  Yet,  shareholders  consider  such  a  move  harmful  to 
their interests.  

It follows that debt overhang can give rise to situations in which shareholders and debt 
holders jointly would benefit from a recapitalization, yet shareholders would not find it in their 

12 

interest  to  recapitalize.  The  benefits  from  the  debt  buyback  are  due  to  the  reduction  of 
bankruptcy costs. However, with debt already in place, all of the benefits produced by a debt 
buyback accrue to debt holders. Since shareholders are unable to appropriate any of the gains due 
to reduced bankruptcy costs, and since they must buy back the debt at a price that reflects the 
reduced risk of debt holders after the buyback, shareholders will resist a recapitalization. 

The observation that shareholders resist a recapitalization even when it would raise the 
value of the firm stands in contrast to the standard “tradeoff theory” of capital structure that was 
pioneered  by  Modigliani  and  Miller  (1963),  where  firms  choose  their  debt  levels  so  as  to 
maximize  total  firm  value  given  the  countervailing  frictions  of  tax  benefits  and  distress  and 
agency costs associated with leverage. In the standard “tradeoff theory”, where capital structure 
decisions are taken ex ante, before any debt has been issued, shareholder value maximization and 
firm  value  maximization  lead  to  the  same  results.  However,  once  there  is  debt  overhang, 
shareholder value maximization and firm value maximization may be in conflict as shareholders 
do not take sufficient account of the effects of their choices on debt holders.12 

Our results show that the consequences of debt overhang in the context of recapitalization 
differ from those in the standard debt overhang problem described in Myers (1977), which can 
lead to underinvestment. When a firm must issue equity to undertake a valuable project, the loss 
to the shareholders due to the wealth transfer to risky debt holders brought about by the reduction 
in  leverage  can  be  more  than  offset  by  the  positive  net  present  value  (NPV)  of  the  project,  a 
portion of which the shareholders capture. Thus, if the NPV of the project is large enough, there 
is no underinvestment problem and the outcome is efficient. By contrast, when a debt buyback 
would  increase  the  total  firm  value,  debt  overhang  always  results  in  a  loss  of  efficiency.  No 
matter how large the gain in value, shareholders will always resist the recapitalization. 

Matters would be different if there were collective bargaining about the price of debt in 
the  buyback.13  For  example,  if  debt  contracts  had  collective  action  clauses,  the  firm's 

                                                 
12  This  point  is  central  to  the  literature  on  dynamic  theory  of  capital  structure,  see  for  example  Strebulaev  and 
Whited  (2012).  However,  despite  its  name,  this  literature  is  more  concerned  with  the  dynamics  of  default  and 
investment decisions for a given capital structure than with the evolution of capital structure through new issues and 
repurchases of debt and equity.  Moreover, leverage changes are often restricted exogenously; e.g. Bhamra et al. 
(2010,  p.  1499)  state  “In  common  with  the  literature,  we  assume  that  refinancings  are  leverage  increasing 
transactions since empirical evidence demonstrates that reducing leverage in distress is much costlier.” 
13 In a different setting the impact of collective bargaining on debt dynamics is also noted by Strebulaev and Whited 
(2012).  

13 

management, acting on behalf of shareholders, could negotiate a buyback agreement with debt 
holder  representatives.  In  such  negotiations,  and  with  the  no-buyback  outcome  as  a  default 
option, debt holders would end up sharing their gains from the buyback with the shareholders. 
This sharing of gains cannot be achieved in a market buyback.  And even in a negotiation, if debt 
holders are dispersed, holdouts could be likely.  In other words, at terms for which shareholders 
would  not  resist  a  recapitalization,  we  would  expect  (at  least  some)  debt  holders  to  resist, 
precluding a purely voluntary leverage reduction. 

 

3.2. Leverage and Investment Distortions 

Our analysis thus far has focused on a specific debt-equity conflict, recapitalization.  But 
the presence of leverage in the firm is likely to lead to additional debt-equity conflicts related to 
investment.  In particular, leverage may induce equity holders to increase the risk of the firm’s 
assets  via  asset  substitution  (as  in  Jensen  and  Meckling,  1976),  or  to  fail  to  undertake  new 
investment opportunities (as in Myers, 1977). In this section we generalize our analysis to allow 
for both asset substitution and underinvestment.  These agency frictions raise the cost of leverage 
for  total  firm  value,  and  thus  increase  the  potential  benefit  of  a  recapitalization.    Yet  we  will 
show that despite this benefit, future debt-equity conflicts only increase shareholder resistance to 
any recapitalization. 

To see the intuition for this result, consider first the case of asset substitution. Suppose 
the  distribution  of  asset  returns,  x ,  may  be  affected  by  actions  taken  by  shareholders  (or 
managers acting on behalf of shareholders).  We denote these actions by , and the resulting 
asset returns by  x , which has distribution 
.  In this setting, it is natural to extend our 
notation and define the value of equity as follows:

Thus, the increase in the value of equity post-recapitalization is even smaller now than in 
* , the level of risk that shareholders 

the setting without agency costs (that is, with  fixed at 
would choose given lower leverage). 

As  the  above  argument  reveals,  the  result  that  agency  costs  increase  shareholders’ 
resistance to recapitalization follows directly from their most basic consequence for the equity 
value  function.    Thus,  we  can  apply  the  same  argument  to  demonstrate  that  any  shareholder 
discretion over future firm investment will lead to a similar result.   

For  example,  suppose  that  in  addition  to  determining  asset  risk  ,  management  (on 
behalf of shareholders) has the opportunity to invest in additional assets  a  by raising capital  k  
from shareholders (or reducing planned equity payouts).  Moreover, suppose these decisions will 
be made at a later date and conditional on some future information  z  that is relevant to both 
asset returns and the profitability of the investment opportunity.  In this case, in addition to asset 
substitution, leverage may lead to future underinvestment due to the traditional debt overhang 
problem  identified  by  Myers  (1977).    The  next  result  demonstrates  that,  once  again,  the 
possibility of future underinvestment and risk shifting, while detrimental to total firm value, will 
only increase the cost to shareholders from a current recapitalization.   

Proposition  3:    Although  shareholder-creditor  conflicts  regarding  investment  may  raise  the 
benefits of a leverage-reducing recapitalization for total firm value, they also raise the costs of a 
recapitalization  for  shareholders  relative  to  a  setting  in  which  investments  were  fixed  at  the 
optimal policy given lower leverage.

As  in  Proposition  1,  the  inequality  follows  because  shareholders  forfeit  their  default 
option for final asset values between

last equality states that the increase in the value of equity per dollar of debt repurchased is less

The first inequality follows since we have fixed the investment policy functions at a level that 
may not be optimal with higher leverage (due to agency costs), the second follows from (10) 
above, and the third follows since the repurchase price of the debt will be at least the no default 
probability  (and  will  be  strictly  higher  if  the  debt  has  a  non-zero  recovery  rate  in  any  default 
states).  

3.3. The Leverage Ratchet Effect  

The standard “tradeoff theory” of capital structure posits that firm’s choose debt in order 
to maximize total firm value given the countervailing frictions of tax benefits and distress and 
agency costs associated with leverage.  Our prior results suggest, however, that once leverage is 
already  in  place,  debt  overhang  will  create  a  powerful  dynamic  that  will  distort  shareholder 
incentives.    In  particular,  we  show  that  not  only  will  the  shareholders  not  choose  to  reduce 
leverage, they will always prefer to increase leverage if they have the opportunity to do so, and 
even  if  this  additional  leverage  further  reduces  firm  value.    In  other  words,  leverage  begets 
additional leverage, creating a leverage ratchet effect.14 

To demonstrate the leverage ratchet effect, consider our setting with taxes, default costs, 
and asset substitution, and suppose that debt is “fully prioritized” so that any debt repurchased or 
issued  is  junior  to  all  other  outstanding  debt  claims.    Because  junior  debt  is  the  cheapest  to 
repurchase and the least attractive to issue, this assumption makes repurchasing debt as attractive 
as possible, and avoids any direct “dilution” of debt if new debt is issued.  Nonetheless, we show 
                                                 
14 This result is closely related to results in Bizer and DeMarzo (1992) and Brunnermeier and Oehmke (2012), where 
they show that given an inability to commit, shareholders will prefer to issue additional debt.  Brunnermeier and 
Oehmke focus on the case of short-term debt (which has effective seniority over existing debt), whereas Bizer and 
DeMarzo demonstrate that the incentive exists even with long-term junior debt, if there are additional investment 
distortions induced by agency costs of leverage.

To illustrate the ratchet effect, we consider an explicit example.  Normalize the asset size 
to 
, and let returns have a binary distribution with either a zero payoff (failure) or a positive 
payoff  (success),  where  the  amount  and  likelihood  of  the  positive  payoff  is  subject  to  some 
degree of discretion.  Specifically, we assume that once any debt is in place, the probability of 
success  p  is chosen by equity holders from the interval

3.4 Leverage Ratchet as an Ex Ante Cost of Debt 

 We have shown that leverage ratchet means that shareholders will not voluntarily reduce 
leverage, even if leverage reduction would increase total firm value. This leads to the question 
why  equity  holders  would  take  on  debt  levels  that  might  lead  to  the  problems  created  by  the 

21 

leverage  ratchet.  What  level  of  debt  D  will  shareholders  choose  initially  and  what  does  the 
leverage ratchet mean for the dynamics of leverage? 

Creditors who understand that they can be subsequently harmed by the leverage ratchet 
can  insist  on  debt  covenants  aimed  at  preventing  shareholder  actions  that  harm  their  interests 
(e.g.  caps  or  restrictions  on  future  debt  issuance17).    However,  unless  these  covenants  are 
extremely restrictive, losses due to the leverage ratchet (and other agency costs) will still be a 
problem.  Indeed,  absent  complete  contracts,  leaving  the  firm  with  some  flexibility  to  adjust 
leverage in response to changes in the environment is desirable.  But debt holders must recognize 
that shareholders will exercise their discretion in an asymmetric manner – increasing leverage 
when  the  opportunity  arises,  but  not  reducing  leverage  even  if  doing  so  would  be  value 
enhancing.  

Specifically,  suppose  that  after  the  initial  choice  of  capital  structure,  circumstances 
change so that the capital structure that maximizes the total value of the firm (taking into account 
all frictions) involves higher leverage, i.e., additional borrowing. In that case, if covenants did 
not prevent such a change, shareholders would certainly choose to increase leverage. The debt 
holders are likely to lose because the default probability will be higher, even though the value of 
the total firm is increased.  

However,  because  of  the  leverage  ratchet  effect,  shareholders  respond  differently  if 
instead of an increase in leverage, changes in the optimal capital structure for the firm involve a 
reduction in leverage. In that case shareholders will resist the change. There is typically little that 
creditors can do to force a recapitalization plan that reduces leverage. It is therefore possible that 
creditors would lose and the total value of the firm would decline because of the resistance of 
shareholders to recapitalization.  

The asymmetry in shareholder leverage decisions has implications for the ex ante choice 
of debt.  First, the leverage ratchet effect suggests that initial debt will trade for a lower price, as 
debt holders internalize the possibility of future value-destroying leverage increases combined 

                                                 
17 Note that the common restriction that any new debt must be junior to existing creditors is insufficient to prevent 
the costs associated with the leverage ratchet effect.  As the example in Section 3.3 illustrates, even the issuance of 
junior debt can harm existing creditors by increasing the likelihood of incurring any deadweight costs of bankruptcy, 
and by exacerbating the distortions due to agency costs such as underinvestment and asset substitution.    

22 

with shareholder resistance to value-enhancing leverage reductions.  This price effect will induce 
firms to take on less leverage initially.   

Starting from this position of lower initial leverage however, the leverage ratchet effect 
has  strong  predictions  for  leverage  dynamics.    Firms  will  actively  increase  leverage  but  only 
passively  reduce  it  (via  debt  maturity  or  growth  in  assets).    Moreover,  we  should  observe  an 
asymmetric response with regard to shocks that impact optimal leverage, such as changes in tax 
rates.    Increases  in  the  value  of  the  debt  tax  shield  should  induce  increases  in  leverage,  but 
reductions in leverage should not cause a similar fall in leverage.   Moreover, even temporary 
increases  in  the  net  benefit  of  leverage  should  lead  to  increases  in  debt  which  are  not 
subsequently  reversed.    Thus,  our  model  of  the  leverage  ratchet  effect  can  explain  what 
otherwise might be quite puzzling empirical results.  

To see how the leverage ratchet might play out, consider the example in 3.3.1 where there 

is no commitment at all.  We demonstrated above that given any choice of leverage, equity 
holders would like to increase leverage if given the opportunity to do so on a one time basis.  But 
if equity holders have the flexibility to increase leverage in the future, this will impact the price 
that creditors will be willing to pay for any current debt issue.  This raises the question of what 
the equilibrium debt choice will be absent any commitment by equity holders not to issue junior 
debt in the future. 

The  question  of  equilibrium  when  the  firm  has  sequential  opportunities  to  borrow  is  a 
delicate one.  Bizer and DeMarzo (1992) consider this problem from the perspective of a risk 
averse  borrower  and  demonstrate  the  likelihood  of  inefficient  equilibria  in  which  the  creditor 
borrows  beyond  the  level  of  debt  at  which  the  total  value  of  debt  is  maximized  (so  that  debt 
forgiveness coupled with restrictions on future borrowing would be optimal for creditors).  Bizer 
and DeMarzo (1994) consider a more general setting in which multiple equilibrium outcomes are 
possible; we use a similar methodology here to illustrate a similar result in the specific context of 
corporate leverage. 

In  our  example  above,  once  the  firm  has  issued  debt  equal  to  the  maximum  possible 
, there is no incentive to increase debt further (all tax shields have been

exhausted,  and  new  junior  debt  would  be  worthless).    Thus  the  debt  level 

0D   is  (trivially) 
sustainable as an equilibrium even without commitment.  Next note that for  D  sufficiently close

nature  of  the  equilibrium  –  firm’s  never  reduce  leverage,  but  “ratchet  up”  to  the  next  stable 
leverage level, in this case 35.6, 66.7, or 80.  Note that in this case all three stable points are 
beyond the efficient level of leverage.

Figure 3 shows the equilibrium calculation with the same parameters but with a tax rate 
of 50% rather than 40%.  Note that the efficient level of leverage increases with the higher tax 
benefit.  However, the lowest stable point is now zero – that is, we might see firms choosing zero 
leverage  despite  the  increased  tax  benefit.    This  outcome  is  supported  as  an  equilibrium  as 
creditors presume the firm will issue debt with face value of 60 if it begins to issue any leverage 
at all.

The two figures together also imply the following possibility – suppose that starting from 
an initial tax rate of 40%, the firm issued debt of 35.6 as per the earlier equilibrium.  If tax rates 

25 

then unexpectedly changed to 50%, the firm would increase debt to 60 as shown in Figure 3.  
Finally, if tax rates were to again unexpectedly change back to 40%, the firm would not reduce 
debt but would increase it yet again to 66.7.  In other words, a temporary increase in the tax 
benefit of leverage would lead to an increase in debt which is not undone when the tax benefit 
disappears. 

Of  course,  to  fully  assess  the  dynamics  of  leverage  we  would  have  to  build  a  fully 
dynamic model in which tax rates, or other factors affecting shareholder preferences, as well as 
asset values are changing continuously and the firm can adjust leverage at any time in response 
to these changes.  While such a model is beyond the scope of the current paper, the ratchet effect 
of leverage that we have documented here is a force that will lead to a gradual upward drift in the 
firm’s leverage.18  This upward drift may be countered by positive innovations in the firm’s asset 
values (through returns or new positive NPV investments) or through debt maturity. 

 

4. Alternative Ways to Reduce Leverage 

Up to this point, we have restricted our attention to the costs and benefits of adjusting 
leverage  by  a  pure  recapitalization  in  which  the  firm  issues  equity  and  uses  the  proceeds  to 
repurchase  outstanding  debt.  In  such  a  transaction,  the  scale  of  the  firm  and  the  assets  on  its 
balance sheet are unchanged.   

However,  a  pure  recapitalization  is  not  the  only  method  available  to  reduce  leverage.  
Leverage  can  also  be  changed  through  adjustments  to  the  scale  of  the  firm’s  assets.    Two 
alternative ways to adjust leverage involve the following transactions: 

  Asset  Sales  (so-called  “deleveraging”):  The  firm  sells  assets  and  uses  the  proceeds  to 

repurchase debt, thus lowering leverage without issuing new equity. 
 

  Asset Expansion: The firm issues equity and uses the proceeds to buy additional assets, 

thus lowering leverage without repurchasing debt.19 

                                                 
18 See DeMarzo and Urosevic (2006) for a similar dynamic related to the selling of shares by a large shareholder in 
the presence of agency costs.  They show that in a continuous time model a similar ratchet effect – identified by 
Admati  Pfleiderer  and  Zechner  (1994)  in  a  static  context  –  leads  to  a  gradual  unloading  of  shares  by  the  large 
shareholder. 
19 Asset expansion was the subject of the original analysis of debt overhang in Myers (1977). Myers shows that 
because existing debt holders capture some of the benefit of the new investment via reduced credit risk, shareholders 
may refuse to undertake a new positive NPV investment project.  

26 

In Figure 4 we illustrate how leverage can be reduced using each of the three responses. 
We  assume  that  the  ratio  of  debt  to  assets  must  be  reduced  from  90%  to  80%.  As  the  figure 
shows, this can be accomplished by selling half of the firm’s assets (asset sales), issuing equity 
equal to 10% of the firm’s assets and using the proceeds to buy back debt (recapitalization), or 
issuing equity equal to 12.5% of the firm’s assets and using the proceeds to invest in new assets 
(asset expansion).

In Admati et al. (2013) we observe that increased capital requirements do not force banks 
to  reduce  bank  lending  because  they  do  not  require  that  banks  shrink.  Increased  capital 
requirements can be met either through recapitalization (B) or asset expansion (C), which either 
leave the size of the bank unchanged or increase it. The analysis below complements Admati et 
al. (2013) by examining the incentives of shareholders in choosing one course of action over the 
others.  Understanding  the  incentives  of  shareholders  is  important  in  assessing  the  effects  of 
imposing  minimum  capital  (equity)  requirements  for  banks,  and  in  particular  determining 
whether capital requirements will induce banks to deleverage via asset sales.

Using the expressions for the value of debt and equity in Section 3, we see that when the 
assets and frictions (including those due to asset substitution) are homogeneous, the total value 
of the firm (equity plus debt) is proportional to its asset holdings and is given by: 
                                                 
20 To keep the focus on how shareholders’ preferences across the various modes of leverage reduction are related to 
changes in firm size, we do not consider the agency costs due to the Myers (1977) underinvestment problem that we 
discussed  above.  To  consider  the  role  that  these  underinvestment  agency  costs  would  play  in  the  shareholders’ 
choice  among  the  three  ways  to  reduce  leverage,  we  would  need  to  make  specific  assumptions  about  how  new 
investment opportunities are related to the size of the firm as given by assets in place.

Recall from Section 3 that if the firm has a single class of debt outstanding, it will be 
 to repurchase its outstanding debt in the market (as this price is the 

forced to pay the price 



value  of  the  debt  to  a  bondholder  who  refuses  to  tender).  Thus,  to  reduce  its  debt  level  to

We  can  therefore  determine  the  effect  of  the  leverage  change  on  existing  shareholders  by 
subtracting  (30)  from  (31).  Specifically,  the  gain  or  loss  for  existing  shareholders  is  given  by 



We are now in a position to evaluate the effect on existing shareholders from alternative 
methods of reducing leverage.  Recall that in a pure recapitalization, there is no change to the 
firm’s assets  

so that

We can ask whether shareholder losses differ across these or other intermediate scenarios. 
As one would expect, the answer depends, among other things, on the relation between the price 
of the assets and their expected rates of return. Recall from (13) that

  then, 

conditional on the final debt-asset ratio being equal to 1, buying or selling assets does not affect

Proposition 5 (An Irrelevance Result): Assume that

and the firm faces no transactions costs in buying or selling assets or the securities it issues. 
Then  shareholders  find  pure  recapitalization,  asset  sales,  and  asset  expansion  equally

Since this does not depend on either 

1A  or 

1D , it is the same for all changes that lead to a given 

reduction in the leverage ratio, proving the result. 

While perhaps surprising at first sight, the intuition for this result is straightforward. If 
asset and security sales or purchases have zero NPV, they cannot change the total value of the 
firm. Because debt holders gain from the decline in leverage, the shareholders must lose an equal 
amount. The gain for debt holders is determined by the change in the average price of the debt, 
which depends only on the change in the firm’s leverage ratio. All of this is captured in the first 
term in the last line of (20). The second term represents losses on the value of existing assets due 
to changes in tax benefits, bankruptcy costs or subsidies resulting from the reduction in leverage 

In Proposition 5, the asset price  p  is taken as given. The firm is treated as a price taker in 
a large market where it has no market power. The proposition should therefore be understood as 
a characterization of the map from asset prices to the firm’s excess demand/supply for assets. At 
the  critical 
,  this  mapping  is  characterized  by  indifference,  i.e.  all  levels  of  asset 

p

)

v 
1(

purchases or sales are equally desirable. At other values of the asset price, of course, indifference 
will not hold, and the firm will strictly prefer to buy or to sell assets depending on whether the 
asset price p is less than or greater than v(1).

4.2 Shareholder Preferences for Different Modes of Leverage Reduction 

In  many  settings,  the  conditions  under  which  Proposition  5  holds  are  violated,  and 
shareholders have a preference for one mode of leverage reduction over the others. We discuss in 
this  section  some  of  the  major  factors  that  can  invalidate  the  irrelevance  result  and  lead  to  a 
firm’s managers (acting in the interest of the firm’s shareholders) choosing one action over the 
others. 

4.2.1 Cases where the asset’s market price and value to the firm diverge 

Proposition 5 concerns the case in which 

p

v 

)

. In other words, we assume that the 

price at which the firm’s assets can be bought or sold is precisely equal to the value of the assets 
1.  What  can  we  say  about  shareholder 
to  the  firm’s  investors  when  the  leverage  ratio  is 
preferences  at  other  prices?  In  this  analysis,  we  begin  by  taking  the  asset  price  p  as 
parametrically given, without considering whether it is consistent with market equilibrium. This 
corresponds  to  the  standard  approach  of  analyzing  the  behavior  of  price-taking  agents  by 
considering  their  demand  and  supply  choices  at  any  parametrically  given  prices.  We  will 
introduce equilibrium considerations once we discuss the parametric analysis.

Taking the asset price as given is justified if the individual firm or bank can be thought of 
as a price taker operating in a large market. However, when we consider what occurs when there 
is  a  policy  change  that  affects  a  large  number  of  firms,  e.g.,  an  increase  in  bank  capital 
requirements, we must recognize that the price-taking assumptions may no longer be justified. 
Even though an individual firm acting alone may be justified in taking the market price of assets 

32 

as given, when all firms change their behavior in response to changes in regulatory requirements, 
it can be expected that the equilibrium market price will change.  

requirements  correspond  to  the  debt-asset  ratio 

For  example,  in  the  case  of  banking  regulation,  assume  that  the  initial  capital 
0   and  that,  for  this  debt-asset  ratio,  the 
, the price at which banks with the debt-asset ratio 
equilibrium asset price is equal to 
0   are  just  indifferent  about  their  asset  holdings.  Now  suppose  capital  requirements  are 
tightened, so that leverage must fall to 
1, and that, because of a reduction in tax benefits and

subsidies  net  of  bankruptcy  costs,  we  have

are assuming in Proposition 5. 

Throughout our discussion, we have assumed that the leverage regulation involves a debt-
asset ratio 
/D A , which is fixed without regard to prices. In practice, regulations such as bank 
capital  requirements  are  often  based  (at  least  to  some  extent)  on  market  values,  imposing  an 
/D p A. The first corresponds to a ratio based 
upper bound on a ratio such as

4.2.2 The Case of Multiple Classes of Existing Debt 

33 

In  this  section  we  consider  shareholder  preferences  when  not  all  debt  has  the  same 
priority.  We  continue  to  assume  that  the  assets  returns  and  the  frictions  are  perfectly 
homogenous with firm size, but we now assume that the firm has multiple classes of existing 
0D D ,  it  is  optimal  for  the  firm  to 
debt  with  different  levels  of  priority.  In  this  case,  if 
1
repurchase the most junior debt first, as it will be the least expensive. For simplicity, we will 
assume  that  all  of  the  debt  that  is  repurchased  is  junior  to  the  debt  that  remains  after  the 
transaction.  Because  a  junior  debt  holder  who  does  not  tender  will  not  be  paid  until  after  the 
remaining debt 

1D  is fully repaid, the junior debt can be repurchased at the price

The  fact  that  junior  debt  is  cheaper  to  repurchase  breaks  the  indifference  result  of 
Proposition 5. Now, shareholders will be better off the more (junior) debt that is repurchased. In 
particular, we have the following important result: 

Proposition 6 (Multiple Classes of Existing Debt): Assume 

1 p



. Then  

i. 

If the firm can repurchase junior debt, shareholders find asset sales preferable to a pure 
recapitalization, which in turn is preferable to an asset expansion. 

ii.  In the case of asset expansion, the ability to purchase junior debt makes no difference 

since no debt is repurchased. 

iii.  In  the  case  of  a  pure  recapitalization  the  shareholders  lose  less  with  the  ability  to 
repurchase junior debt than they lose when there is only one debt class, but they still lose. 
iv.  In  the  case  of  asset  sales,  shareholders  may  gain  if  the  reduction  in  leverage  is 

sufficiently small.

gain with asset sales if they can repurchase junior debt, we consider the case in which there are 
no frictions. Since in a pure asset sale the proceeds from the sale are used solely to repurchase 
junior debt, we know that N = 0. This means that

This  result  explains  why  shareholders  may  choose  to  engage  in  asset  sales  or 
“deleveraging”  (as  opposed  to  recapitalization  or  asset  expansion)  if  a  decrease  in  leverage  is 
imposed by regulation and there are no covenants protecting senior debt holders. While it is well 
known that an asset sale that is used to fund payouts to equity holders will benefit shareholders at 
the  expense  of  creditors,  our  result  (iv)  above  states  that  equity  holders  can  gain  even  if  the 
proceeds are used to buy back junior debt.  While total leverage declines and junior creditors 
gain, senior debt holders lose even more (as their claims are backed by a smaller pool of assets).  
If allowed, shareholders therefore prefer this form of deleveraging over a pure recapitalization or 
asset expansion.

This result extends Proposition 5 by showing that that irrelevance to scale continues to 
hold if new debt is of equal seniority to existing debt. Shareholders would not choose to expand 
if any of the new debt issued must be junior to existing debt. An interesting case is one where the 
new debt can be senior to existing debt. This case might be relevant for banks, which rely on 
significant amounts of short term debt. Short term debt is effectively senior to the bank’s long-
term debt. Proposition 7 suggests that shareholder losses are decreasing in the scale of the firm 
in  this  case.  This  suggests  that  if  new  debt  can  be  senior,  shareholders  might  prefer  asset 
expansion beyond even the level of balance sheet C in Figure 4.  

 

4.2.3 The Case of Heterogeneous Assets 

Proposition 5 is based on an assumption that the firms’ assets are homogeneous, i.e., each 
asset unit has a return of  x  so that the total return on all assets is simply  xA . When assets are 
homogeneous in this way, sales and purchases only change the scale of the firm, but not the risk 
of  the  debt  for  any  given  level  of  maintained  leverage.  If  assets  are  heterogeneous,  and 
particularly  if  they  differ  in  their  contribution  to  the  overall  risk  of  the  firm’s  asset  base, 
shareholders will generally have preferences with respect to which assets to sell or purchase. If a 
firm deleverages through asset sales, shareholders prefer to sell relatively safe assets. In contrast, 
they will prefer to purchase relatively risky assets if the firm expands. This is just a manifestation 

37 

of the asset substitution agency problem that we have discussed above. When the shareholders 
can engage in asset substitution through asset sales or asset purchases, simple recapitalization, a 
transaction  that  leaves  the  asset  base  unchanged,  is  unlikely  to  be  the  preferred  choice.  The 
choice between deleveraging or asset expansion depends on the costs of selling less risky assets 
relative to the costs of purchasing more risky assets. The transactions costs associated with assets 
sales  and  purchases,  especially  those  arising  from  asymmetric  information,  are  potentially 
important in this regard and these are discussed in sections 4.2.4 and 4.2.5 below. 

In the context of capital regulation for banks, an attempt is made under Basel II and Basel 
III  to  address  the  problems  created  by  asset  substitution  and  risk  shifting.  This  is  done  by 
assigning risk weights to assets and formulating capital requirements in terms of the size of the 
risk-weighted asset base. If the risk weighting system worked perfectly and completely removed 
the ability of bank managers and shareholders to engage in asset substitution and risk shifting 
when  assets  are  sold  or  purchased,  asset  heterogeneity  would  not  necessarily  undermine  the 
irrelevance result given in Proposition 5. In particular, if risk weighing effectively means that the 

1q
value of debt depends only on leverage as measured by the risk weighting system, so that 
 
will  be  the  same  no  matter  what  the  mode  of  leverage  reduction,  then  the  conditions  for 
proposition 5 to hold are potentially restored even with heterogeneous assets.   

In practice risk weighting falls short of removing the ability of banks to increase risk and 
engage in asset substation. Indeed, the regulations often involve transparently inappropriate risk 
weights, e.g., a zero risk weight for sovereign debt or for highly rated securities even when they 
clearly carry some potentially significant risks. Making matters worse is the fact that in practice 
the implementation of the risk weighting system relies in part on the banks’ own internal risk 
models  and  is  therefore  highly  manipulable.  This  means  that  there  is  large  scope  for  bank 
shareholders to gain in the two modes of leverage reduction that involve changes in assets.  

 

4.2.4 The Effects of Transactions Costs 

Proposition  5  is  based  on  the  assumption  that  the  firm  faces  no  transactions  costs  in 
changing  the  scale  of  its  assets  or  in  issuing  and  retiring  securities.  Not  surprisingly  the 
introduction  of  transactions  costs  can  lead  to  one  alternative  being  preferred  over  the  others, 

38 

since the three ways of changing leverage that we consider involve different pairs of transactions 
as shown below: 

 

The firm purchases: 

The firm sells: 

Asset Sales 

Recapitalization 
Asset Expansion 

Debt 
Debt 
Assets 

Assets 
Equity 
Equity 

 

Asset  expansion  will  be  the  preferred  alternative  if  the  transactions  costs  involved  in 
repurchasing debt are particularly large relative to the other transactions, but this is unlikely to be 
the case. The transactions costs involved in equity issuance and asset sales are likely to be more 
important.  If  equity  issuance  costs  are  large  relative  to  those  in  asset  transactions,  then  asset 
sales,  since  they  involve  no  equity  transactions,  will  be  the  preferred  alternative.  If  the 
transactions costs involved in selling assets are particularly large compared to equity issuance 
costs  (e.g., 
then 
recapitalization or asset expansion will be preferred. Without making specific assumptions about 
the magnitude of the various transactions costs, little more can be said about what approach will 
be most advantageous for shareholders. 

the  firm  faces  extreme  “firesale  conditions” 

in 

liquidating  assets), 

 

4.2.5 The Effects of Asymmetric Information 

A key component of transactions costs in settings such as the ones we are considering is 
due to the possibility that the firm’s managers have private information about the firm’s assets 
and growth opportunities.  Managers will want to sell assets that the market is overvaluing and 
similarly will want to issue equity if they perceive the market is overpricing the firm’s shares. 
The possibility that managers will make strategic choices based on their private information can 
account for a significant part of the bid/ask spread for transactions involving the firm’s assets 
and securities. Information asymmetries can be particularly important in asset sales and equity 
issuance  and  this  explains  why  transactions  costs  for  these  are  likely  to  be  larger  than  those 
associated with debt buybacks.  

Asymmetric information factors that would affect the valuation of the firm’s assets in the 
asset sales approach clearly also give rise to asymmetric information issues affecting the market 

39 

valuation  of  the  firm’s  equity  when  the  firm  issues  equity  directly  (as  opposed  to  a  rights 
offering) to recapitalize or expand its assets.21  It is clear that if there is asymmetric information 
about the value of the assets in place, there must be asymmetric information about the value of 
the firm’s equity. It is not immediately obvious whether this makes it more expensive for the 
firm’s shareholders to sell assets and deleverage or to sell equity and recapitalize. In fact, it can 
be  shown  that  in  some  circumstances  asymmetric  information  about  asset  values  makes  the 
shareholders  indifferent  between  the  two.  This  can  occur  when  the  firm’s  assets  are 
homogeneous, the firm is known to have no growth opportunities, and the leverage requirement

is based on the ratio

If the market is undervaluing the firm’s assets and this is the only source of transactions costs 
facing  the  shareholders,  then  shareholders  will  be  indifferent  between  asset  sales  and 
recapitalization as ways to meet the leverage requirement. (See appendix for a precise statement 
of the result and proof.) Although a greater dollar amount of assets needs to be sold in the asset 
sales  approach  than  the  dollar  amount  of  equity  that  needs  to  be  issued  to  effect  a 
recapitalization, the underpricing of equity is larger in percentage terms because of leverage, and 
this is just sufficient to make the loss due to underpricing equivalent.22 

                                                 
21  Note  that  in  Myers  and  Majluf  (1984)  the  asymmetric  information  that  makes  management  reluctant  to  issue 
equity relates to the value of assets in place as well as the value of the investment opportunity the equity issuance 
would  finance.  The  key  assumption  in  the  Myers  Majluf  (1984)  analysis  is  that  the  firm  can  only  raise  equity 
through an offering of common shares and not, for example, through a rights offering. With symmetric information, 
as in Proposition 5, it does not make a difference whether new equity is raised through an offering of shares to the 
market or through a rights offering. With asymmetric information, it does make a difference. In a sale of new shares 
to the market, the market’s assessment of the firm directly impacts the amount of money raised by the firm. In a 
rights offering, if it succeeds, the market’s assessment of the firm does not affect the amount of money raised by the 
firm, but only the value of shares and therefore the value of the rights. The attitude of existing shareholders to a 
rights offering then depends on whether they are short-term investors, who are interested in the current share price, 
or  long-term  investors  à  la  Myers-Majluf,  who  are  interested  in  returns  and  share  prices  in  the  future,  when  the 
market will have learned about the underlying values. 
22 One might wonder why the results we obtain for asymmetric information differ from those presented above in 
4.2.1, where we assume that the market price for the firms’ assets differs by  from the value of the assets when 
they are held by the firm. Since in section 4.2.1 we assume that there is symmetric information about the value of 
the assets if they are held by the firm, it follows that when that value differs from the market price, there is uniform 
 Whether the firm should 
agreement that the firm should either be selling assets if 
grow or shrink is unambiguous, and this makes the preferred mode of leverage reduction depend on the amount of 
assets sold or bought. With asymmetric information the situation is quite different. When equity is issued, the price 
is  based  on  the  market’s  perception  of  the  total  value  of  the  assets  and  any  losses  are  due  the  market’s 
undervaluation of that total. As discussed above, the same amount of assets is effectively sold at undervalued prices 
when equity is issued as when assets are sold directly. This means that while in the analysis of 4.2.1 the losses or 
gains are based on the amount of assets sold, in the case of asymmetric information the losses are based on the 
market’s valuation of all the assets. It does not matter whether the assets are directly sold or indirectly sold through 

0  and buying assets if 

0.

40 

If  the  firm’s  assets  are  heterogeneous,  the  situation  involving  asymmetric  information 
becomes  more  complex.  Transactions  costs  due  to  asymmetric  information  are  likely  to  be 
lowest  on  the  least  risky  assets.  As  discussed  above, asset substitution considerations  indicate 
that the shareholders will want to sell low-risk assets when deleveraging, but will want to buy 
high-risk  assets  in  the  asset  expansion  approach  to  reducing  leverage.  This  means  that 
transactions  costs  concerns  and  asset  substitution  will  tend  push  shareholders  toward  the 
deleveraging  alternative.  With  deleveraging,  incentives  associated  with  asset  substitution  and 
transactions cost minimization are aligned. This is not the case with asset expansion. 

Note,  however,  that  deleveraging  is  not  always  the  preferred  alternative  from  a 
transactions costs perspective. If most assets are hard to value by outsiders and managers can 
pick the assets they sell, then the adverse selection effects can be greater with asset sales than 
they are when equity is sold. This is because equity represents a claim on a portfolio of assets 
rather than an adversely selected subset. The transactions costs associated with issuing equity can 
be lower than those involved in selling hard to value assets. This could tip the balance in favor of 
recapitalization. 

Finally, it should be noted that one way that leverage can be reduced that involves almost 
no transactions costs due to asymmetric information is for the firm to retain earnings and build 
equity “internally.” Adverse selection costs can also be eliminated by raising equity through a 
rights offering. Shareholder resistance to these ways of reducing leverage is entirely due to debt 
overhang.  

5. The Leverage Ratchet in Banking  

Our analysis has important implications for understanding the use of debt by banks and 
for  banking  regulation.  With  debt  on  the  order  of  ninety-five  percent  of  total  assets  and 
sometimes more, banks are the most highly leveraged corporations in the economy. In the years 
2007-2009,  this  high  leverage  meant  that  many  banks  were  unable  to  absorb  the  losses  they 
suffered, and various chain reactions led to major breakdowns in funding and credit across the 
globe.  Since  then,  capital  requirements  for  banks  have  been  a  key  subject  of  policy  debate. 

                                                                                                                                                             
issuance of equity — the loss is the same. A long-term investor, who is patient enough to wait until the market has 
learnt,  would  however  take  a  different  view  if  equity  was  raised  through  a  rights  offering;  see  the  preceding 
footnote. Such an investor would prefer the rights offering to a sale of assets. 

41 

Regulators have raised these requirements a bit but regulation still allows banks to fund as much 
as  97  percent  of  their  assets  by  borrowing.  Banks  have  been  successfully  lobbying  against 
increases  in  capital  requirements.  They  claim  that  increased  requirements  would  limit  their 
ability to lend to the real economy and to promote economic growth. 

Our  results  show  that  the  fact  that  we  see high  levels  of  leverage  in  banking  does  not 
imply that these high levels are desirable. The levels we observe may well be inefficient, even 
without considering the negative externalities that distress and default of banks can have on the 
rest of the economy. As we show, high levels of leverage can be the result of the leverage ratchet 
and can reduce the value of the bank to its investors.   

Of  course,  there  always  is  a  sense  in  which  the  results  of  voluntary  contracting  are 
efficient  in  some  nth  -best  version  of  efficiency  that  takes  account  of  all  incentive constraints, 
including those that arise from imperfect commitments. If perfect ex ante commitments cannot 
be made or are ineffective, then future behavior is not fully determined by initial contracting. 
The observed outcomes then depend on subsequent decisions, which may involve conflicts of 
interest that are not reined in by contracting. If that is the case, the notion that observed outcomes 
are nth-best efficient relative to the given commitment technologies is not relevant for the policy 
debate.  Regulatory  measures  that  constrain  the  banks’  subsequent  decisions  might  replace  or 
strengthen missing or ineffective covenants in initial contracts, and thus improve on the banks’ 
ability to commit their future behaviors. 

Our analysis suggests that the observed high leverage in banking, and particularly the use 
of  short-term  debt,  can  in  fact  be  explained  by  the  lack  or  ineffectiveness  of  covenants  in 
contracts and by the consequences of conflicts of interests in subsequent funding decisions. The 
following effects that we have discussed are immediately relevant: 

  Even if the value of the bank could be increased by leverage reduction, shareholders on 
their own would not generally choose to reduce the firm’s leverage and buy back debt, 
unless they can use some form of collective bargaining to make debt holders give up their 
share  of  the  benefits.  On  the  contrary,  regardless  of  what  the  debt  level  might  be, 
shareholders  would  want  to  increase  leverage  if  this  enables  them  to  take  additional 
advantage of the differential treatment of debt and equity in corporate taxation.  

  Once significant leverage is in place, shareholders have an incentive to increase leverage 
even if doing so is value destroying, as they no longer internalize the consequences of 
additional  leverage  on  existing  creditors.    This  incentive  is  enhanced  if  new  debt  can 

42 

usurp  the  priority  of  existing  claims.    While  outright  dilution  may  be  ruled  out  by 
covenants prohibiting the issue of new debt that is senior or equal in status to incumbent 
debt,  such  covenants  can  be  circumvented  if  the  new  debt  matures  earlier  than  the 
incumbent debt. The “maturity rat race” of Brunnermeier and Oehmke (2013) is fully in 
line with the logic of our analysis. The effect is strengthened if the bank is free to secure 
the new debt with collateral, which in itself reduces the resources that are available to 
incumbent debt holders in bankruptcy. 

 

If regulation forces a bank to decrease its leverage, shareholders will try to impose part of 
the  cost  on  incumbent  senior  creditors  and  the  deposit  insurance  system.  Shareholders 
can do this by selling relatively safe assets and buying back junior debt. The reduction in 
assets  worsens  the  senior  debt  holders’  prospects;  moreover,  the  effect  is  stronger  the 
safer  are  the  assets  that  are  sold.  By  focusing  on  junior  rather  than  senior  debt, 
shareholders  both  minimize  the  cost  of  the  debt  buy  back  and  devalue  any  remaining 
claims. In fact, shareholders might gain by this form of deleveraging if the dilution of 
senior creditors (and the deposit insurance system) is sufficiently large.  

All  these  effects  involve  shareholders  making  decisions  that  take  advantage  of  debt  holders. 
These  decisions  are  socially  inefficient,  and  they  would  not  be  taken  if  prior  contracting  to 
prohibit them was feasible and enforceable. When the government safety net is present, however, 
creditors no longer have strong incentives to protect themselves in any way, since many of the 
risks have been shifted to the government and its taxpayers. As a result, the protections to guard 
against such in efficiencies will not occur via private contracting and so will only be provided 
through appropriate regulation. 

The effects that we have described are in line with what we observe. For example, when 
in the fall of 2011, European authorities mandated banks to increase their core equity up to nine 
percent of risk-weighted assets by June 30, 2012, many banks responded by using cash to buy 
back hybrid debt, i.e., the most junior kind of debt they had.23 

In  the  2000s,  we  have  also  observed  a  dramatic  expansion  of  short-term  borrowing 
through repo contracts, and the enormous repo markets continue to be a source of concern to 
regulators.    Repo  borrowing,  which  legally  is  not  borrowing  but  a  combination  of  a  sale  and 
repurchase,  is  effectively  a  way  to  issue  new  debt  ahead  of  any  incumbent  debt,  jumping  the 
queue of claimants in default, getting ahead even of depositors because the repo collateral is not 
available to repay them, let alone other creditors.  

                                                 
23 Pre-Basel III, some of this hybrid debt had been issued to as “Tier 2 Capital”. With the regulators’ shift in focus 
towards common equity, this role of hybrid debt became less important.  

43 

Our findings are directly relevant for the policy discussion. To the extent that the high 
indebtedness  of  banks,  and  particularly  their  high  short-term  indebtedness,  reflects  leverage 
ratchet  effects  in  the  absence  of  prior  commitments,  efficiency  concerns  about  regulatory 
interference  in  private  contracting  may  not  be  relevant;  to  the  contrary,  regulatory  rules  may 
improve the basis for private contracting by giving debt holders more confidence that they will 
not be taken advantage of in the bank’s subsequent funding decisions.   

Most academic contributions to the policy debate have focused on the economic role of 
bank debt, in particular, short-term bank debt.24 One line of argument is based on the theory that 
banks’  reliance  on  funding  by  short-term  debt  that  must  be  constantly  rolled  over  is  useful, 
because the need to make sure that refinancing is always available imposes discipline on bank 
managers. A manager who “misbehaves” must fear that funding will evaporate and the bank will 
fail.25 Another line of argument is based on the theory that short-term bank debt is useful to debt 
holders because they cherish the liquidity of their claims, i.e. the ability to turn them into cash 
whenever they wish, without worrying much about their value.26  

Elsewhere,  we  have  provided  detailed  critical  assessments  of  both  lines  of  argument, 
noting, in particular, that they are strikingly in conflict with each other.27 Whereas the discipline 
approach to explaining the prominence of short-term debt in bank funding presumes that debt 
holders  are  constantly  monitoring  to  make  sure  that  bank  managers  do  not  misbehave,  the 
liquidity approach presumes that debt holders are happy to have an asset about which they do not 
have to worry. “Information insensitivity” of bank debt, i.e., the fact that, in normal times, the 
returns debt holders can expect are independent of the bank’s returns on its assets, is taken to 
provide the basis for the liquidity of bank debt. Because bank debt is information insensitive, the 
story  goes,  in  normal  times,  nobody  has  an  incentive  to  invest  in  information,  and  therefore 
nobody must fear being taken advantage of by better informed investors. If debt holders do not 

                                                 
24 Some contributions also refer to asymmetric information and the analysis of Myers and Majluf (1984) as a reason 
for  why  banks  would  respond  to  increased  capital  requirements  by  reducing  their  lending.  As  noted  in  the 
introduction, however, the Myers-Majluf argument, only shows that the issuance of new equity by a sale in the open 
market can be “expensive”. The argument does not explain why banks would resist other forms of raising equity; 
according to Myers and Majluf (1984), banks should actually prefer raising funds by retaining earning rather than 
adding to their borrowing. For further discussion see Admati et al. (2013, Section 6).  
25 See Calomiris and Kahn (1991), Dewatripont and Tirole (1994, 2013), Diamond and Rajan (2000, 2001, 2013),

invest in information, however, it is difficult to see how they would impose discipline. Hence the 
two  narratives  have  strongly  conflicting  views  about  the  role  of  information  collection  and 
monitoring by short term creditors.  

Leaving aside the details and the differences of the two approaches, it is important to see 
that both are based on the presumption that the financing patterns of banks that we observe must 
be efficient. In this spirit, French et al. (2010) warn against raising equity requirements for banks 
on the grounds that tighter equity requirements might reduce benefits from debt as a disciplining 
device. Appealing to the other approach, DeAngelo and Stulz (2013) claim that higher equity 
requirements  would  reduce  banks’  ability  to  provide  the  economy  with  deposits  that  people 
cherish for their liquidity. Their analysis, however, is highly problematic.28 

Some, e.g., Gorton (2010, 2012) have suggested that the growth of repo borrowing and 
lending  in  the  2000s  was  due  to  a  very  large  demand  for  liquid  bank  debt.  In  Gorton’s 
interpretation, overnight repo loans are a modern version of deposits, and the expansion of bank 
borrowing in the past decade was largely a response to the economy’s need for liquidity. The 
inference is that, even though the repo market is highly fragile and subject to runs, it would be 
unwise to curb its scope.29  

By contrast and consistent with our model, the growth of repo borrowing and lending can 
also be explained by a combination of a leverage ratchet and maturity rat race in borrowing. In 
this interpretation, the bankruptcy exemption of repo that was granted in 2005 enabled growth. 
Whereas the liquidity interpretation presumes that repo growth has been beneficial, our analysis 
                                                 
28 DeAngelo and Stulz (2013) analyze optimal behavior of banks under the presumption that the liquidity benefits 
from deposits translate into a liquidity premium in the deposit rate. Under their assumptions about technology and 
preferences however, this presumption is incompatible with competitive equilibrium. DeAngelo and Stulz do not 
actually discuss market equilibrium, let alone whether equilibrium outcomes are efficient. They also assume away 
any return uncertainty of the assets in which banks invest depositors’ funds. As discussed in Admati et al. (2013) 
and in Admati and Hellwig (2013a, Chapter 10, 2013b, c), since the returns on banks’ assets are uncertain, it is 
essential to consider that default risk harms the liquidity of deposits and that additional equity that reduces default 
risk  might  actually  enhance  the  liquidity  of  deposits.  Gorton  (2012)  does  not  analyze  equity  requirements,  but 
suggests that they would not be very useful because banking crises are due only to runs and panics from short-term 
funding. Short-term debt is taken to be what banks “produce,” without taking account of the possibility that banks 
would  take  risk  with  the  borrowed  money  and  may  become  insolvent,  and  without  asking  how  this  possibility 
impacts creditors or taxpayers.  
29 Gorton (2010, 2012) acknowledges the vulnerability to runs and panics but suggests that it would be preferable to 
deal with this problem in the same way the analogous problem with deposits was dealt with, by deposit insurance, 
i.e., government-backed guarantees  and backstops.  As  argued  in Admati  et al  (2013,  Section 7) and Admati  and 
Hellwig (2013a, Chapter 10, 2013b,c), the quality of liquidity provision would actually be improved if banks had 
more  equity,  because  then  the  banks’  short-term  debt  would  be  even  more  informationally  insensitive  and 
trustworthy. 

45 

throws doubt on that presumption. The prominence of repo in the funding of large banks may 
well be due to commitment failures and is therefore inefficient, even for the banks themselves.30  

The  case  for  regulation  of  an  industry  usually  rests  on  external  effects  by  which  the 
decisions of a firm affect third parties. In the case of banks, in particular large banks, external 
effects are indeed very important because the failure of a large bank can cause severe damage to 
the entire economy. For example, the billions of dollars, euros or pounds that were lost by the 
creditors in the bankruptcy Lehman Brothers, declared in September, 2008, were dwarfed by the 
trillions of dollars that were lost by the subsequent disruption of economic activity.  

Some  people  question  the  appropriateness  of  regulatory  intervention  infringing  the 
autonomy  of  corporate  decision  making.  Because  of  the  large  social  cost  and  inefficiencies 
associated  with  bank  distress  or  failure,  fairness  considerations  should  not  be  focused  on  the 
narrow  perspective  of  those  shareholders  holding  concentrated  positions  in  banks  and  their 
managers, who are the only ones losing in the immediate aftermath of leverage reduction in the 
private markets. Regulators must take into account all impacted parties.  

The case for capital regulation of banks rests not only on the substantial external effects 
that bank borrowing and risk taking exerts on the rest of the financial system and the economy. 
Capital  regulation  also  protects  the  banks’  creditors,  the  deposit  insurance  fund  and  taxpayers 
who bear the costs of the inefficiencies that arise when banks are excessively leveraged. In light 
of  our  results  about  the  potential  inefficiency  from  a  lack  of  commitment  powers,  regulatory 
intervention might actually end up being beneficial for the banks themselves and their immediate 
counterparties.  

In  the  case  of  banks,  distortions  leading  to  excessive  borrowing  are  exacerbated  by 
prospects  of  support  when  things  go  wrong.  Such  support  was  amply  provided  in  2007-2009; 
some of which is still being maintained. The rationale behind this support is to prevent collateral 
damage caused by the default of some institutions; as we have learned, because of the high level 
of  interconnectedness  in  the  financial  system,  such  collateral  damage  can  be  very  large.31  In 
addition,  when  banks  are  distressed,  they  often  cut  lending  and  this  can  harm  the  broader 

                                                 
30 Acharya, Schnabl, and Suarez (2013) also suggest that the increase in size of wholesale markets may have been 
caused by distorted incentives rather than an unbounded “need for liquidity.”

economy.32 However, the prospect of government support makes creditors more willing to lend 
to banks; if they expect to be bailed out by the government, they need not be given a premium 
for default risk.  

Our  analysis  in  Section  4  has  important  implications  for  how  banks  adjust  to  higher 
equity  requirements  or  recover  from  crises.  As  we  have  shown,  there  are  a  number  of 
circumstances  under  which  banks  would  choose  to  reduce  leverage  by  selling  assets  and 
shrinking.  Asset  sales  might  also  be  the  fastest  way  for  banks  to  reduce  leverage.  The 
destabilizing effects of many banks simultaneously deleveraging through asset sales would be 
greatly reduced if banks were much better capitalized, i.e., “deleveraging multiples” are much 
lower. This is yet another benefit of higher equity requirements. 

Insolvent banks would find it difficult, and possibly impossible, to raise new equity from 
investors,  and  they  may  therefore  have  to  resort  to  asset  sales  in  order  to  appear  sufficiently 
capitalized. It is critically important for regulators to recognize hidden insolvencies and intervene 
in  such  cases.  As  seen,  for  example,  in  the  Savings  and  Loans  crisis  in  the  US  in  the  1980s, 
insolvent banks are subject to many distortions and might inflict additional costs on taxpayers.33 
Analyses of how the government should provide supports to the banking system34 take 
the original capital structure of the bank as given and do not consider regulatory interventions to 
reduce  banks’  leverage  when  it  gets  excessive.  If  banks’  capital  structure  is  inefficient  and 
harmful,  however,  regulators  are  in  a  position  to  force  banks  to  reduce  their  leverage  in  the 
private markets.  

                                                 
32 See, for example, Bernanke and Lown (1991). Diamond and He (2012) analyze the impact of different maturities 
of debt on debt overhang in investment. These papers take the capital structure of the banks as exogenous. 
33  Asset  sales,  and  the  accompanying  shrinkage  of  bank balance  sheets,  can  be  socially  beneficial.  For  example, 
subsidies associated with high leverage can lead banks to become overly large and complex and encourage them to 
hold assets that would be uneconomical for them to hold absent the subsidies. If subsidies are reduced with leverage 
reduction,  the  allocation  of  assets  in  the  economy  might  become  more  efficient  as  banks  sell  assets.  An  added 
benefit is that this would make banks smaller and less complex to manage, regulate and unwind. A concern often 
raised in this context is that the assets sold would be held by entities in the so-called “shadow banking system.” This 
only  highlights  the  importance  of  effective  enforcement,  something  essential  for  any  regulation  to  achieve  its 
objective. See Admati and Hellwig (2013a, Chapter 13).  If asset sales are considered undesirable, regulators should 
avoid giving banks full discretion as to how to reduce their leverage. In the transition to better capitalizations, if 
policy makers are concerned with a reduction in lending, it again becomes important to reduce the discretion banks 
have  to  adjust  their  leverage.  Rather  than  direct  them  to  achieve  a  particular  ratio,  regulators  should  focus  on 
reducing  payouts  that  deplete  equity,  and  possibly  mandate  specific  amounts  of  new  equity  for  banks  to  issue. 
Directing banks in this way would lead banks to have sufficient funds with which to make worthy loans, and prevent 
inefficient contraction.  
34 See, for example, Phillipon and Schnabl (2013), and Bhattacharya and Nyborg (2013).

The  leverage  ratchet  effect  suggests  that  shareholders  would  resist  such  regulatory 
actions, but also that there is a justification for the action because of the collateral damage of 
default. Moreover, the anticipation of bailouts creates significant moral hazard and encourages 
even  further  risk  taking  and  leverage,  because  these  actions  increase  the  value  of  the  implicit 
government  guarantees.  Perversely,  therefore,  bailouts  exacerbate  the  inefficiency  of  the 
leverage ratchet, feeding the addiction to leverage that the effect creates.  

The forms of support that banks receive from central bank or governments rarely include 
injections  of  new  common  equity.  Central  banks  aim  to  provide  only  “liquidity  supports”  to 
solvent banks, which amount to lending money to the banks against “good enough” collateral, 
i.e., assets whose value is at least as high as the loan, but in recent years some of the collateral 
has been questionable. Governments may also “inject capital” through various forms of preferred 
equity, which amounts to funding in exchange for promises that are junior to all debt.  Whereas 
such  supports  provide  funds  to  distressed  banks  that  alleviate  their  immediate  problems  and 
allow them to avoid default, they can have the effect of increasing the banks’ leverage from the 
perspective of shareholders.    

Indeed,  allowing  distressed  or  even  insolvent  (“zombie”)  banks  to  continue  operating, 
and especially supporting them by cheap credit or by preferred shares, does not generally address 
the distortions associated with their distress.35 Examples of such programs are European Central 
Bank  through  the  Long  Term  Refinancing  Operation  (LTRO),  which  provided  cheap  loans  to 
banks, and Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) in the US in 2008-2009, which was based 
on  preferred  equity.  Consistent  with  our  observations,  neither  the  LTRO  program  nor  TARP 
resulted in significant increases in (business) lending.36 

More  generally,  capital  regulation  often  allows  for  non-equity  claims  to  be  counted  as 
“regulatory  capital,”  including  preferred  equity,  or  so-called  “silent  participation”  claims,  and 
various  forms  of  hybrid  securities.  Many  have  argued, in particular, that  “bail-inable  debt”  or 
various forms of contingent capital or even long-term debt should be counted as a way to satisfy 
capital regulation on the presumption that they would be able to absorb losses or to relieve the 

                                                 
35 See Admati and Hellwig (2013a, especially Chapter 11).  
36 On the LTRO program, see Acharya and Steffen (2013), who refer to the LTRO as “the greatest carry trade ever.” 
Anecdotal evidence that the program did not improve lending includes such stories as Louise Armistead, “ECB's 
LTRO plan flops as banks cut lending,” Telegraph, March 28, 2012. Cole (2012) shows that banks receiving capital 
injections  from  the  TARP  failed  to  increase  their  small-business  lending,  and  instead  decreased  their  lending  by 
even more than other banks.

banks’ distress when necessary (or in a resolution process). However, it is important to recognize 
that  any  security  that  has  a  privileged  position  relative  to  common  equity  gives  rise  to  debt 
overhang and leverage ratchet effects. It is therefore important that capital regulation focuses on 
increasing the fraction of common equity used in the funding mix of banks and other financial 
institutions.  

 

6. Concluding Remarks  

In  this  paper  we  analyzed  an  agency  cost  of  debt  that  stems  from  subsequent  capital 
structure choices of firms that already have debt in place. This agency cost, which we call the 
leverage ratchet effect, biases the shareholders of leveraged firms towards leverage increases and 
against leverage decreases.  

In the absence of full commitments and complete contracts, the agency costs of debt tend 
to increase the ex ante costs of funding mixes that include significant borrowing. Debt covenants 
that try to deal with the ratchet effect might forbid all borrowing until the debt is paid, but such 
constraints, like other covenants reduce the flexibility of the firm subsequently.  

Because it represents an additional agency cost of debt, the leverage ratchet effect may 
help explain why some firms choose very low leverage. It is well known that low leverage gives 
firms  more  flexibility  to  take  advantage  of  investment  opportunities  without  constraints  from 
covenants and helps them avoid the negative effects of subsequent debt overhang. The leverage 
ratchet  effect  strengthens  this  rationale  for  low  leverage  by  the  observation  that  low  leverage 
helps  firms  avoid  the  inefficiencies  associated  with  excessive  subsequent  leverage.  This  may 
contribute to our understanding of the so-called “zero-leverage puzzle.”37 

As  we  discussed,  the  leverage  ratchet  effect  applies  immediately  to  banks  and  other 
financial institutions whose creditors, particularly short-term creditors who may have access to 
collateral  and  depositors,  do  not  constrain  subsequent  leverage  increases  through  contracts. 
Because high leverage exacerbates the other agency costs of debt such as underinvestment and 
asset substitution, banks’ high leverage is a source of inefficiency, including social inefficiency 
if  there  is  collateral  damage  of  distress  and  default.  Moral  hazard  problems  associated  with 
explicit and implicit government guarantees exacerbate the problems. Regulation that allows a 
form of commitment to a more efficient capital structure with lower leverage can therefore play

an important role. The analysis in this paper reinforces the conclusions of Admati et al (2013) 
that equity requirements significantly higher than those currently considered would provide large 
social benefits at little if any social cost.

Appendix 

We state here precise conditions under which the current shareholders will be indifferent 
between asset sales and recapitalization when the market is undervaluing assets in place. We will 
assume that the market undervalues the firm’s assets in the following sense: for each asset unit 
that the market perceives, the firm actually has 1 v  units and this difference is perceived by the 
,xA  but 
firm’s managers. Thus the market assumes that the realized value of the assets will be
