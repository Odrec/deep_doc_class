The Ethics of Poverty Tourism 
Evan Selinger and Kevin Outterson 

 
Abstract 
 
Poverty tours—actual visits as well as literary and cinematic versions—are characterized as 
morally controversial trips and condemned in the press as voyeuristic endeavors.  In this 
collaborative essay, we draw from personal experience, legal expertise, and phenomenological 
philosophy and introduce a conceptual taxonomy that clarifies the circumstances in which 
observing others has been construed as an immoral use of the gaze.  We appeal to this taxonomy 
to determine which observational circumstances are relevant to the poverty tourism debate.  
While we do not defend all or even most poverty tourism practices, we do conclude that 
categorical condemnation of poverty tourism is unjustified.  
 
Introduction 
 

Reality tourism in impoverished areas goes by several names; critics call it “poorism;” a 

more neutral term is “poverty tourism.”i  Articles in The New York Times, Smithsonian 

Magazine, Newsweek, The Wall Street Journal, The Huffington Post, and other popular media 

characterize these as trips as morally controversial.ii  Critics attack not just actual visits, but also 

virtual poverty tourism through film.iii  In the film Slumdog Millionaire, the protagonist is an 

orphan from Mumbai’s Dharavi slum.  Shyamal Sengupta, a film professor at the Whistling 

Woods International Institute in Mumbai, condemns the film for being a poverty tour.iv  In the 

month before it won the Oscar for Best Picture, Slumdog Millionaire was derided as “poverty 

porn” in the pages of the London Times.v National Public Radio even ran a lively episode of 

“Talk of the Nation” devoted to the topic called “‘Poverty Porn’: Education or Exploitation?”.  

Are poverty tours really the moral equivalent of pedophiliac tourism in Southeast Asia?vi 

Far from being a trendy and short-lived topic of conversation, the debate over poverty 

tourism reaches back at least to Victorian London, where “slumming” was both vilified and 

celebrated, fueling both prostitution and significant social welfare institutions.vii  In all 

likelihood, poverty tourism is much older than critics acknowledge.
