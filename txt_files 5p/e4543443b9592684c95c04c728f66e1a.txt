ABSTRACT
One of the fundamental principles of visual
cortical organization is that neurons form a ‘‘map’’ in which
neighboring cells have similar orientation preferences. Pre-
vious anatomical and imaging studies have shown that al-
though the exact layouts of these orientation preference maps
vary between individuals, features of iso-orientation domains
such as width and spacing appear constant within a species.
Using chronic optical imaging of intrinsic signals we now
demonstrate that in ferret area 17 a larger proportion of
cortical surface is dominated by responses to horizontal and
vertical contours than to the two oblique orientations. This
was true for all ferrets studied both during development and
in adulthood. Interestingly, however, we found that the degree
of the overrepresentation varied significantly between indi-
vidual animals. In some young ferrets, responses to horizontal
and vertical stimuli developed faster than responses to oblique
stimuli, and a much larger percentage of the cortex responded
preferentially to horizontal and vertical stimuli. In other
individuals, responses to all stimuli developed at roughly the
same rate, and there was relatively little overrepresentation of
horizontal and vertical preferences.

We have used chronic optical imaging of intrinsic signals (1) to
examine developing orientation activity maps in ferret primary
visual cortex. The ferret was chosen for these studies because
it has a visual system similar to the cat’s (2) but is born
approximately 3 weeks earlier in development (3), thus pro-
viding a robust physiological preparation during the time that
orientation-specific responses develop (ref. 4; see also refs. 5
and 6).

The technique of optical imaging permits observation of the
overall spatial organization of orientation preference across a
region of visual cortex, information not easily obtained from
single-unit studies. Furthermore, by measuring the collective
response of a large number of neurons simultaneously, optical
imaging avoids many of the sampling problems that can occur
in studies of single-cell responses. Chronic imaging allows the
development of orientation maps to be followed over time in
individual animals, removing the necessity to pool data across
animals. This technique therefore is not only ideal for assessing
the proportion of cortical surface devoted to processing dif-
ferent orientations during development, but it can also reveal
interanimal variability in the representation of orientation
preferences, which would be missed by conventional electro-
physiological recordings.

All of the ferrets in this study (eight developing and three
adult) showed a significant overrepresentation of horizontal
and vertical versus oblique orientation preferences in their
cortical maps. In the eight developing ferrets, there were large

differences in the magnitude of this anisotropy. Furthermore,
in the developing animals with larger anisotropies, the hori-
zontal and vertical activity maps also tended to develop
significantly faster than the oblique maps.

The bias toward horizontal and vertical preferences seen in
all of the ferrets studied is consistent with electrophysiological
studies in the cat (7–14) and kitten (15), which suggest that
there may be more cortical cells with horizontal and vertical
preferences. The observed interanimal variability in the degree
of the bias is surprising, as previous studies have suggested that
basic features of iso-orientation domains such as hypercolumn
spacing are relatively constant between animals (refs. 16–24;
but see also ref. 25). The variability may, however, help to
explain why some laboratories have failed to demonstrate the
horizontal兾vertical bias electrophysiologically in either cats
(26–28) or kittens (29–31). Finally, this variability might
underlie the interindividual variation that has been observed
in psychophysical studies of the ‘‘oblique effect’’
in cats,
monkeys, and humans (32–36).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Optical Imaging of Intrinsic Signals. Eight young (31–35
days old at the beginning of the experiments) and three adult
(4.5 months to 1 year old) ferrets (Marshall Farms, New Rose,
NY) were used in this study. Experiments were performed
under aseptic conditions by using standard procedures for
optical
imaging (37). Anesthesia was induced by using a
mixture of xylazine and ketamine. Animals were intubated and
mechanically ventilated. Anesthesia was maintained by using
1–3% halothane delivered in a 3:1 mixture of nitrous ox-
ide:oxygen. End-tidal carbon dioxide was maintained at 3.8–
4.2%. Subcutaneous injections of ⬇1 ml兾hr 5% dextrose
Ringer’s solution were administered to prevent dehydration.
During the initial imaging session, the scalp was incised and
retracted and a craniotomy was performed over the caudal
pole of the left hemisphere. The dura remained intact. Two
percent agar and a glass coverslip were applied over the
craniotomy. Animals were fitted with contact lenses to focus
the eyes on the monitor placed 33 cm in front of the animal.
The brain was illuminated through the dura by using a halogen
lamp and fiber optics, with the illumination band-pass filtered
at 707 ⫾ 10 nm, a wavelength that provides good penetration
of the dura. The signals were recorded with a cooled charge-
coupled device camera (Princeton Instruments, Trenton, NJ)
and a macroscope (38) focused approximately 500 ␮m below
the cortical surface. Five frames of 600-msec duration were
collected during each 3-sec stimulus presentation. Following
each recording session, the agar and coverslip were removed,
and the craniotomy was flushed with sterile saline and covered

with a 3% agar plug containing chloramphenicol antibiotic
(Paraxin, Bayer). The fascia and scalp were sutured and the
scalp wound was infused with lidocaine and covered with a
topical antibiotic. The animal was then allowed to recover
from the anesthesia before being returned to its mother.

Visual Stimuli. Visual stimuli were produced by using
custom-made software (STIM, Kaare Christian, Rockefeller
University, NY) and were presented binocularly on a 21-inch
monitor placed 33 cm away from the ferret. The stimuli
consisted of full-screen square-wave gratings drifting at 10–
15°兾sec, presented at four different orientations: horizontal,
vertical, and the two obliques. The spatial frequency ranged
from 0.5 to 0.15 cycles兾degree (this value was chosen empir-
ically to optimize the activity signal and varied with age
probably because of changing optics in the ferrets’ maturing
eyes); the same spatial frequency was used for all orientations
in a given recording session. The stimuli were randomly
interleaved, and each was generally presented 128 times.

Calculation of Activity Maps and Polar Maps. To reduce
noise in the acquired images, signal averaging was used. To
remove nonorientation-specific signals such as uneven illumi-
nation and blood-vessel artifacts from the maps, each orien-
tation activity map was normalized to the average of maps seen
in response to all orientations (for details, see ref. 9). The
resulting images are termed single-condition maps.

The information from single-condition activity maps in
response to all four orientations of stimuli were combined into
single, color-coded ‘‘polar maps’’ by using vectorial addition on
a pixel-by-pixel basis (for details, see ref. 9).

Calculation of Orientation Preference Areas. The propor-
tion of cortex that prefers each of the four orientations was
determined by calculating an ‘‘orientation preference area’’ for
each orientation from data contained in the polar maps. The
first step in this analysis was to determine a region of interest
(ROI) for each animal containing only the area of the map
where orientation-specific activity was seen in the most mature
map. Next, the data in the polar maps from each animal at each
recording age were passed through a threshold procedure such
that all dark pixels with little or no orientation-specific re-
sponse (vector length ⬍0.1 of maximum) were not included in
any of the four orientation preference areas. The orientation
preference area for each orientation was then calculated as the
percentage of total pixels within the ROI whose response
preference fell within the four 45° orientation ranges centered
on 0, 45, 90, and 135° (i.e., those pixels within a given color
range). The polar maps were chosen for this analysis because
they give a better indication of the area of cortex that prefers
a given orientation than do the single condition maps, which
show the area that responds to a given orientation.

The threshold value of 0.1 was chosen for this analysis
because it resulted in inclusion of ⬍5% of total pixels in very
early maps that appeared featureless and inclusion of ⬎75% of
pixels in the most mature maps studied in each animal. Varying
the threshold value to 0.01 (resulting in inclusion of ⬎90% of
pixels in the most immature maps) to vector length 0.2
(resulting in inclusion of only 25% of pixels in the most mature
maps) did not change the basic shapes of the orientation
preference area graphs.

To quantify the uncertainty in this measurement, orienta-
tion preference areas were calculated for individual data
blocks (each block representing the response to 64 stimulus
presentations) recorded from each animal during each record-
ing session, as well as for the entire session. The multiple blocks
allowed us to estimate the standard deviation in the measure-
ments.

To provide a single number characterizing its magnitude we
defined the anisotropy from the orientation preference areas
as [(horizontal ⫹ vertical) ⫺ (left oblique ⫹ right oblique)]兾
(total area) ⫻ 100%. A 100% anisotropy would result from
maps where there was no representation of the obliques; a 0%

anisotropy would result if there were equal representation of
all orientations.

Determining the rate of the development of responses to
each orientation from the response area data is problematic
for two reasons. First, the final map recorded in each animal
may not represent a completely mature map, so there is no
available measure of the fully developed anisotropy in each
animal. Second, any quantitative analysis of the rates of
development of response areas would necessitate modeling the
growth rate, and there is no theoretical or empirical reason for
us to adopt any particular underlying mathematical func-
tion—in some animals (e.g., ferret 1-5-413) the development
appears approximately linear whereas in others (e.g., ferret
1-2-413) it does not.

Cross-Correlation Analysis of Map Maturation. To quan-
tify how mature each orientation activity map was at each age
in a model-independent manner, two-dimensional (2-D) cross-
correlations were performed between each recorded activity
map and the most mature map recorded for that stimulus
orientation in that animal. The first step in the correlation
analysis was to determine an ROI for each animal as described
above. To control for possible misalignment of the maps, we
calculated the correlation coefficients between the two maps
for x and y offsets ranging from ⫺30 to 30 pixels (each pixel
corresponds to 36 ⫻ 36 ␮m2 of cortex). The largest of these
values was then taken as the measure of correlation between
the two maps. A value of 0 indicates an immature map; a value
near 1 indicates a more fully developed map. Note that no
significant brain growth occurs during the period covered by
these experiments (37) and thus is not a confounding factor in
this analysis.

RESULTS

Optical imaging of ferret area 17 was performed through the
intact dura, and activity maps in each animal at each age were
generated in response to moving square-wave gratings at each
of four orientations: horizontal, vertical, and the two obliques.
Examination of the resulting images revealed different pat-
terns of orientation development. In some ferrets, activation of
iso-orientation domains responding to horizontal and vertical
gratings developed faster than domains responding to ob-
liquely oriented gratings. These animals also showed greater
overrepresentation of cortical area preferring horizontal and
vertical stimuli. In other ferrets, domains responding to all
orientations developed roughly in parallel. These ferrets
tended to show only a modest overrepresentation of horizontal
and vertical preferences.

Activity maps illustrating the range of the developmental
patterns observed are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Each row of these
figures shows orientation-specific maps recorded in the left
primary visual cortex at the indicated age. The first four
columns show single-condition activity maps recorded in re-
sponse to a specific orientation. To determine the overall
organization of orientation preference in the cortex, informa-
tion from the four activity maps was combined into a single,
color-coded ‘‘polar map’’ shown in the right-most columns. In
the polar maps, the color of each pixel encodes the preferred
orientation of cells in that region of cortex, whereas the
brightness indicates the orientation selectivity (for details see
refs. 9 and 39).

Maps from a ferret showing faster development of horizon-
tal and vertical domains are shown in Fig. 1. In this animal,
there was little or no orientation-specific response to any
stimulus during the earliest imaging session on postnatal day
32. By postnatal day 35, however, clear horizontal and vertical
activity maps were present, although weak if any maps were
seen with oblique stimuli. Oblique maps became obvious,
though still weak, by postnatal day 37. Horizontal and vertical
maps appear to be fully developed (i.e., no longer changing) by

FIG. 1. Faster development of horizontal and vertical than of oblique orientation maps. Each row of the figure shows orientation maps recorded
in the left primary visual cortex of one ferret at the age (postnatal day, p) indicated at the left of the row. The first four columns show orientation
maps recorded in response to a particular orientation of moving square-wave grating (0° ⫽ horizontal). The fifth column shows the polar map
calculated from those four single-condition maps. For each map, caudal is up and medial is to the left. The curve in the upper left corner of each
map indicates the location of the caudal pole of the cortex behind which the skull remained intact over the cerebellum. The approximate location
of the area 17兾18 border can be seen in each image as a line rostral to which orientation activity is not seen. Single-unit recordings were not
performed in this study to precisely locate the area of the visual field studied in each animal. However, the craniotomies were always performed
at the same location on the skull with respect to skull sutures, exposing what has previously been found to be the representation of area centralis
(2, 3). In this example the first orientation maps can be seen at postnatal day 35. At this age only horizontal and vertical maps are clearly seen.
The orientation maps for the two oblique orientations develop considerably slower (they are first clearly seen at p37) and the difference in the
strength of the maps remains present throughout the experiment. (Bar ⫽ 2 mm.)

postnatal day 42, whereas oblique maps remain weaker and
continue to mature through postnatal day 45, the last imaging
session for this animal.

Fig. 2 shows data from an animal where the development of
orientation maps appears to have progressed at a more or less
equal pace for all orientations tested. In this animal faint maps
are already visible at postnatal day 32. At this and all subse-
quent ages, the strength of the activity maps in response to all
four orientations appears approximately equal on visual in-
spection.

To obtain quantitative measures of these results, the devel-
opment of orientation maps in individual animals was studied
by using two different methods. First, the ‘‘orientation pref-
erence area’’ (see Materials and Methods) was determined for
each stimulus orientation at each age. The results of this
analysis are shown in Fig. 3. At early ages in all animals, there
are no obvious orientation-specific domains in cortex. As the
animals mature, a larger proportion of the cortex becomes
orientation-selective. All eight ferrets tested showed signifi-
cantly larger orientation preference areas for horizontal and
vertical during development (two-factor ANOVA, P ⬍ 0.001
for all, except P ⬍ 0.01 for ferret 1-6-3630; posthoc one-tailed
t tests of time-averaged data, P ⬍ 0.02 for all animals). The

magnitude of the anisotropy at the final experimental time
point (see Materials and Methods) ranged from 3.5 to 61.6%
across animals. Although this measure appeared to vary along
a continuum, the interanimal variability is highly significant
(one-factor ANOVA, P ⬍ 0.001).

To provide a measure of the rate of orientation-map devel-
opment in each animal, early single-condition maps were
compared with the most mature map by using cross-
correlation. Because we have previously shown that the struc-
ture of each orientation activity map in an individual animal
is stable during development (37), this correlation coefficient
provides a good measure of map maturity. The results of this
analysis are shown in Fig. 4. The four animals with the largest
anisotropies (Fig. 3, upper four panels) also show faster
maturation of their horizontal and vertical activity maps than
of their oblique maps (two-factor ANOVA, P ⬍ 0.001; Fig. 4,
upper four panels). The four animals with smaller anisotropies
(Fig. 3, lower four panels) showed roughly parallel maturation
of their activity maps for all orientations (two-factor ANOVA,
P ⬎ 0.05, except P ⫽ 0.023 for 1-4-3630; Fig. 4, lower four
panels).

For comparison, we also measured the anisotropy in three
adult ferrets. A significant overrepresentation of horizontal

and vertical responses was seen in all three (Fig. 5). The
magnitudes of the anisotropy seen in the adults ranged from
8.9 to 17.0%. These values are in the range seen in the
developing ferrets.

DISCUSSION

Using chronic optical imaging based on intrinsic signals to
study the maturation of orientation activity maps in ferret
primary visual cortex, we have demonstrated that there is a
remarkable degree of interanimal variability in the represen-
tation of orientation during development. In half of the young
ferrets studied, horizontal and vertical orientation domains
developed faster, and there was a large overrepresentation of
the cortical area preferring horizontal and vertical stimuli
(anisotropies in the final map of 28.5–61.6%). In the other half
of the ferrets, all orientations developed roughly in parallel,
and there was a smaller overrepresentation of horizontal and
vertical preferences (anisotropies in the final map of 3.5–
22.0%).

One might be concerned that artifacts in the imaging system
or the visual stimulus display might have caused the overrep-
resentation of horizontal and vertical preferences observed
here. We think we can rule out this possibility because such
artifactual anisotropies would be expected to be constant over
time and thus could not account for the observed changes in
the magnitude of the anisotropy during development within
animals. More importantly, such artifacts could not explain
why the anisotropy varied so dramatically between animals,

especially because animals with large and small anisotropies
were often recorded on the same day.

Also, measurement uncertainty or sampling problems can-
not account either for the observed interanimal variability or
the anisotropy itself. The uncertainty in our measurements of
orientation preference area for each orientation is generally
smaller than the observed anisotropies and interanimal dif-
ferences (see variation across multiple measures in Fig. 3 and
statistical tests in Results).

Previous electrophysiological studies have reported that the
overrepresentation of horizontal and vertical preferences is
stronger in simple cells (7, 9, 10) and in the central visual
representation (7, 9–13). Optical imaging signals are primarily
derived from responses in the upper layers of cortex (42),
where there are few simple cells. So, if anything, our data might
have produced an overall underestimation of the anisotropy in
the area devoted to different orientations. The number of
simple cells sampled by imaging, however, should be similar
from animal to animal, so it seems unlikely that this could
explain the observed interanimal variability. That the data for
all our animals were collected across a wide area of cortex
approximately centered on area centralis also makes it improb-
able that visual field effects could account for the observed
interanimal variability.

Sampling problems have always been a major concern in
electrophysiological studies of orientation anisotropy. Al-
though a larger proportion of cells with horizontal and vertical
preferences has been reported (7–15), many of these results
may not be statistically significant (for review see ref. 15), and
similar studies in other laboratories have failed to find a

FIG. 3. Quantification of orientation preference areas. Orienta-
tion-specific response areas were calculated in each animal at each age
as described in Materials and Methods. Values calculated for blocks of
data from individual trials are shown to provide information on the
noise in the measurement; combined data for all trials at a given
orientation in a given animal at a given age are indicated by the
symbols connected by lines. In all eight animals studied, horizontal and
vertical response areas are significantly larger than oblique response
areas (two-factor ANOVA, P ⬍ 0.01 for ferret 1-6-3630; P ⬍ 0.001 for
all other animals). However, the magnitude of the anisotropy varies
between animals. Note that ferrets 1-2-413 through 1-5-413 were
littermates, as were ferrets 1-3-3630, 1-4-3630, and 1-6-3630. Ferrets
1-4-413 and 1-4-3630 were females.

horizontal兾vertical bias (26–31). The problem arises because
it is indeed difficult to demonstrate the significance of a small
deviation from equal representation. For example, if a popu-
lation of neurons falls into two categories (horizontal兾vertical
vs. oblique) with an anisotropy magnitude equal to the mean
of our adults (12%), then to demonstrate that this distribution
is significantly different (P ⬍ 0.05) from random would require
a sample size of ⬇275 neurons. Furthermore, the nonrandom
spatial distribution of orientation preferences across cortex
exacerbates the problem by biasing the sampling within elec-
trode tracks. All these problems are much less severe in optical
imaging studies where orientation preferences across a large
area of cortex are studied in every cortical map. Single-unit
studies, of course, have their own advantages in that they
provide critical data on receptive field properties, such as the
orientation tuning of individual neurons, which cannot be
obtained by using optical imaging techniques.

A number of psychophysical ‘‘oblique effects’’ have been
described (32–36) with better performance on perceptual tasks
for horizontal and vertical stimuli than for the obliques. This
may be a direct consequence of the overrepresentation of
horizontal and vertical orientation preferences. Like the elec-
trophysiologically determined bias, the oblique effect is stron-
gest in the central visual field (40, 41). More interestingly with
respect to our results, the magnitude of the oblique effect in

attributed to a wide variety of factors, including gender (43),
visual experience (44, 45), and genetic differences (46, 47).
Gender cannot explain the interanimal differences seen in our
study, because both males and females showed both patterns
of orientation development. Visual experience also seems
unlikely to have caused the interanimal differences, because all
of the ferrets in this study were raised in the same environment,
and the bias was present as soon as orientation selectivity could
be seen in cortex at or near the time of natural eye-opening.
In our present approach, genetic components cannot be ruled
out. Individuals in the same litter, however, did show both
developmental patterns.

It has been clear since ocular dominance columns were first
visualized by using 2-deoxyglucose (16–21) that cortical maps
between individuals vary in their exact layout. More recently,
significant interanimal differences in the periodicity of ocular
dominance columns (25) and the related measure of blob
density (48) have been seen. These studies, however, do not
show any differences between animals in the proportion of
cortex devoted to processing information from the two eyes.
Our results demonstrate that a fundamental feature of
cortical organization, the proportion of cortex that prefers a
particular orientation, can show profound interanimal differ-
ences. Closely related individuals, raised in identical visual
environments, have fundamentally different cortical mapping
of orientation during the developmental period when orien-
tation-specific responses in cortex are maturing. Whether the
differences between individuals in the degree of bias toward
horizontal and vertical orientation preferences is intrinsically
programmed or whether it is due to the visual environment
remains to be determined in future investigations. However,
the interanimal differences in the development of orientation
maps have profound consequences for both electrophysiolog-
ical and computational studies of orientation development.
Electrophysiological studies can no longer assume that there
are no significant differences between individual animals in
the representation of orientation, and computational models
must be able to account for the range of patterns of orientation
development seen in this study.
