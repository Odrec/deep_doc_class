3. COMING BACK TO THE HYPOTHESES 

4. DISCUSSION 

THE MAIN HYPOTHESES

• Autonomous Affect is a Singularity: It is filled 
with all different kinds of potentials and its 
multiple layers are infinite. 

• Due to its Singularity and its Autonomy, affect 
is everywhere.

HOW DOES MASSUMI 

ARGUE HIS CASE?

HOW DOES MASSUMI 

DEFINE QUALITY, INTENSITY, 

AFFECT AND EMOTION?

2.1. QUALITY, INTENSITY, EMOTION AND AFFECT

Quality and Intensity:     
- both embodied and autonomic  
- Quality also partly conscious 
-

Intensity: strength and duration of an effect, links what is separate 

Emotion:          
-

is qualified intensity: it gives an affect its meaning 

Affect:              
- equated with Intensity 
- qualifiable as an emotional state

HOW CAN AFFECT 
BE A SINGULARITY?

2.2. THE MISSING HALF SECOND

Experiment:  
Bodily response (brain wave measurement) always ½ second 
before conscious perception of the stimulus  
-> Higher cognitive functions are simply measurable

2.2.HOW THIS WORKS ACCORDING TO MASSUMI

- Traces from all our past actions are conserved in the brain 
matter (in case of decision possible pathways to go)  
- Intensity = begin of these pathways that can either be 
gone  
or not = affect -> ½ second 
- but not perceivable -> no ”present time”  
-> it does not exist, it is virtual 
-> PARADOX, because the body is actual at the same time  
- Therefore other paradoxes can be possible too,  
e.g.: Past – future (missing present), Sad – happy

SINGULARIT Y IS A TURNING POINT FILLED WITH ALL THESE 

PARADOXES  

-> THIS IS WHY AFFECT IS A SINGULARIT Y  

HOW IS AFFECT 
AUTONOMOUS?

2.3. THE AUTONOMY OF AFFECT

GILBERT SIMONDON

- Affect is autonomous in the body (the inside)  
- represents a person’s vitality, potential for interaction  
- affect can escape the body too  
- Emotions = an expression of the capture of affect  
- But there is also a rest that is not captured   
- Their autonomy is the autonomy of affect (the outside)  

- Affect is autonomous in the inside and in the outside  

- Humans perceive: Capture of affect  and Escape of affect

HOW CAN AFFECT ”BE 
THE WHOLE WORLD”?

2.4. THE UBIQUITY OF AFFECT

- Normality is a perception, a result or interaction between variables. 
- Affect and emotions are contrary, because of the perception of the 

message.  

- Affective is opposed to emotion.  
-

Is not related with empathy or emotive identification Confidence  
= Emotional translation of affect  

- Affection as a metaphor. -> It can take place in any place, in any 

form. Such as Atoms -> it’s everywhere 

- Affection is autonomous through its singularity. Singular open. 
- there is no boundary in affection; there is no semantical distinction 
- There are cultural aspects that limit the perception of the ”Reagan” 

example.

THE ABILITY OF AFFECT TO PRODUCE AN ECONOMIC EFFECT 

MORE SWIFTLY AND SURELY THAN ECONOMICS ITSELF 
MEANS THAT AFFECT IS ITSELF A REAL CONDITION, AN 
INTRINSIC VARIABLE OF THE LATE-CAPITALIST SYSTEM, AS 

INFRASTRUCTURAL AS A FACTOR

– Brian Massumi

“

- affect is more powerful than economics because it doesn't depend on any 

other variables. 

- Economy perceived as political situation, capitalism's phantom. 
-
-

it is itself a real condition 
It is an intrinsic variable that connects society 

THE HYPOTHESES

• Autonomous Affect is a Singularity: It is 
filled with all different kinds of potentials 
and its multiple layers are infinite. 

• Due to its Singularity and its Autonomy, 
affect is everywhere.

THANK YOU FOR LISTENING

Questions?

DISCUSSION

Question 1: 

Massumi is claiming that affect is autonomous in all living, as well as in nonliving 
things. Do you agree with that? Would you also consider things (as for example 
a photograph) to have an affect in the same way that humans do?

Question 2 

Do you agree that affect is non-conscious and automatic? Wouldn’t that speak 
against free will, in a way that we are not free to choose how to feel about 
events in the moment of their occurring?

Question 3 

What we think Massumi is failing to explain: How can something as virtual and 
filled with Paradoxes as affect be bound to a physical body? How does this 
connection work
