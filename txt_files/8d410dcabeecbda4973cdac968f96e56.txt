“Refugees	Welcome?	Migration,	Citizenship	and	the	Question	of	Rights”	

In	this	lecture,	Leti	Volpp	will	consider	the	relationship	between	migration,	citizenship	
and	rights	by	focusing	upon	a	particular	sign,	its	transatlantic	circulation,	and	
contestation	as	to	its	meaning.	The	sign	…	was		created		in		1990		as		a	trafAic	sign	by	the	
California	Department	of	Transportation	in	order	to	deter	drivers	from		hitting		
pedestrians		crossing		freeways		near		border		checkpoints		in		Southern	California.		In	
the	United	States,	the	sign	is	correlated	with	illegal	immigration.		The	symbol			of			
immigrants			running			re-emerged			under			the			banner			of			“Refugees	Welcome”	in	
Europe,	as	seen	in	football	stadiums	and	train	stations	across	Germany	in		late		August,		
2015.	Tracing	this	image’s	circulation	an	its	transformations	demonstrates	how	
dramatic	events	in	recent	months	have	shaped		
immigration	and	refugee	policies	in	both	the			
United	States	and	Germany.	This	investigation			
also	sheds	light	on	the	triangulated		relationship		
	between		the		illegal		immigrant		and		the	refugee,		
a	relationship	shaped	by	racialization,	territoriality,		
and	a	dissimilar	access	to	rights,	whether	as	hu-	
mans,	or	noncitizens.
