Phonetics - the study of speech sounds

Properties of speech sounds studied in Phonetics:

● physical (acoustic)

● physiological

● articulatory

● auditory

ABR (auditory 
brainstem 
response)

3

Segmentation of speech sounds

Problem: 
● Talker variability
● Rate variability
● Context variability

➔ Search for invariance: 
How is the same speech sound 
identified from different 
voices, in different speech 
and non-speech contexts?

Classification - articulatory features

vowels

Classified according to:
● Height
● Backness
● Roundedness

Classification - articulatory features

consonants

Classified according to:
● manner of articulation 
● place of articulation 
● voicing
● voice onset time
● ...

Phonology - systematic organisation of sounds

what role does a sound in a particular language play?

is a (small) difference in the sound relevant?

what phonemes exist in the language?

10

Definitions

● a phone is just a distinct type of sound, classified by 

its phonetic (≠ phonological, phonemic) features 
(independent of language!)

● phonemes are the basic sounds that a language makes use 

of

● allophones are phonetic variants of a phoneme

notation: 
phones in square brackets (e.g.[θ]) - phonemes between slashes (e.g./e/)

11

Exercise - determining phonemes

[puɫ] vs. [pul] 

[dɪˈluʒən] vs. [dɪˈluʃən]

[puɫ] vs. [pʊɫ]

[ˈwɔtər] vs. [ˈwɔɾər]

[ʧip] vs. [ʤip]

12

[puɫ] vs. [pul] 

[dɪˈluʒən] vs. [dɪˈluʃən]

[puɫ] vs. [pʊɫ]

[ˈwɔtər] vs. [ˈwɔɾər]

[ʧip] vs. [ʤip]

no phoneme!

phoneme!

13

Allophones - characteristics

●

●

appear complementarily distributed: in contexts where we find one variant, 
we never find the other
appearance is predictable from the phonetic context - 
hence the difference is only caused (determined) by the ‘phonetic
neighbourhood’ and not in order to mark a phonemic distinction!

14

Exercise - finding minimal pairs

given the following set of words 
{thy, rot, bee, heard, bin, thigh, hat, lot, had, bean, root, look}

find the minimal pairs!

Exercise - finding minimal pairs

{thy, thigh}
{rot, lot}
{bin, bean}
{hat, had}
{rot, root}

16

Suprasegmental properties of speech

● refers to a phonological property of more than one sound 

segment

● applies to several different linguistic phenomena (such 

as pitch, duration, and loudness)

● ...speech melody, tone, stress, intonation... 
➔ any sound variation above the level of the single segment 

17

Morphology - the internal structure of words

principle categorisation of words

OPEN-CLASS WORDS
( = major categories, lexical categories, content words)

CLOSED-CLASS WORDS
( = minor categories, functional categories, function words)

●
●
●
●

Nouns
Verbs
Adjectives
Adverbs

●
●
●
●

Prepositions
Determiners
Conjunctions
...

why open-class? → readily accept new 
members

why closed-class? (self-explanatory)

18

Morphology - the internal structure of words

three notions of “word”
• Lexeme (=Lemma): 
• Word form: 
• Grammatical word:  A pair of a phoneme/grapheme sequence and a grammatical

Element which must be stored in the mental lexicon
A sequence of phonemes/graphemes

    classification

19

Exercise

Determine the number of word forms, grammatical words and 
lexemes of the word “like”  

20

Morphology - the internal structure of words

coming to morphemes - smallest meaningful units (make up 
words)

free morphemes

bound morphemes

●
●

usually (!) can appear alone
function as (function/content) 
words

●

●

must be combined with other (free) 
morphemes 
also called affixes

examples: (content) girl, nice, love, 
away, (function) and, in, the, she, is

examples: (derivational) pre-, -ly, -
ness, -re‐, un‐, (inflectional) -ing, 
-er, -s

21

Morphology - Allomorphs

● subtypes of one morpheme, convey the same grammatical 

information

● what allomorph appears where is either determined by the 

lexicon, or is phonologically conditioned (see english 
plural formation)

22

Inflectional morphology

● concerned with inflection (modification of one lexeme to 

express different grammatical categories)

● productive process (generates word forms and applies to 

arbitrary new words!)

● grammatical features are often conveyed by the affixes

conjugation of verbs  ↔ 

declension of nouns, 
adjectives and pronouns

23

Phenomena in Inflectional Morphology

PARADIGM (regular inflectional patterns) SUPPLETION (inflected form is irregular)

Partial (weak) suppletion: some similarity is discernible
Full (strong) suppletion: inflected forms are highly dissimilar 

24

Finite State Transducers

basically like an FST 
(isomorphic), but with 
the ability to transform 
input symbols into output 
symbols

can be used to generate 
underlying forms/surface 
forms of words, given the 
grammatical specification 

An FST is a 7‐tuple <Q, Σ,    , q0, F, δ, σ>:
Q: a finite set of N states q0, q1,...,qN‐1
Σ: a finite set of input symbols.
   : a finite set of output symbols.
q0ϵQ: the start state
F ⊆ Q: the set of final states, F ⊆ Q
δ(q, w): the transition function between states. Given a 
state qϵQ and a string w Σ*, δ(q, w) returns a set of new 
states Q' ⊆ Q. 
σ(q,w): the output function giving the set of possible 
output strings for each state and input.
