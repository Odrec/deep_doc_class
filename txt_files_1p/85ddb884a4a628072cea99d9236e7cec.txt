“Causation and Mental Causation” 

by Kim (2007) 

 

But this does not rule out mental causation in general! 

 

 
[The Problem]  
How to account for the common-sense idea that intentional thoughts or intentional mental 
states are causes of intentional actions. The problem divides into several distinct sub-
problems:  Causal Exclusion | The Problem of Anomalism | The Problem of Exteranlism 
 
Donald Davidson 
Only physical events are relevant in causal relations - other mental events are causeless and 
effectless.  
 
Davidson’s argument for mental causation: 
Every causal relation has to have an “underlying” strict law and strict laws are purely 
physical. However, Davidson argues that this implies that the requirement for an individual 
mental event (token) to be involved in a causal relation is an appropriate physical description 
that instantiates a physical law.  
 
The Problem 
Davidson’s account is based on the claim 
that causation must instantiate strict laws. 
Kim objects why should that be the case?  
 
Jerry Fodor 

The Solution 
Either to abandon Davidson’s strict laws 
requirements or relax it by allowing non-
strict laws—”ceteris paribus” hedging 

Fodor’s approach does not need strict laws, he assumes 

1)  Ms are nomologically sufficient for Bs 
2)  Psychological laws are hedged  

→ Mental events can be causes 

Ms → Bs, ceteris paribus which can be rewritten as a strict law:  
Whenever C obtains, Ms → Bs               → Causation is identified as nomological regularity! 

Kim’s objections 

1)  Can we deduce causation from nomological regularity? 

Kim: correlation (regularity) ≠ causation 

 

Fodor: supervenience does not exclude
