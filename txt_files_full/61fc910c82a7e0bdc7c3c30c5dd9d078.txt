GENERAL INFORMATION 

• Study Projects:  

• LP: 12 (per semester), 24 (for the two-semester course) 

• Participants in study projects should work during the whole 

year including the breaks (at least this is the idea) 

• The grades in study projects are recognized as examination 

results 

• Interdisciplinary Course 

• LP: 8 (per semester) 

• Participants of interdisciplinary courses work together with 

the members of the study project for one semester.

GENERAL INFORMATION 

• What is a study project?  

• Some Features 

•

In order to get a certificate you need to work for one year in a 
team 

• Classical milestones and important aspects to assess a final grade 

are 

• A public presentation at the beginning when the general tasks and goals 

are determined (can be waived) 

• A presentation after six months to document the preliminary results (can 

be waived) 

• Final presentation 
• Final report 

• Currently, there are also other possibilities to document the results of 

the project 

• Further aspects are  

• Ability to work for one year in a team 
• Ability to cooperate with other team members 
• Motivation to work in fields that are not in the personal focus and 

interests 

• Etc.

GENERAL INFORMATION 

• Some further features 
• Planning of the project 

• A project must be carefully planned 

• There will be a master plan in order to coordinate the work of 

the people 

• This plan must regularly be updated 
• Resources and Documentation 

• For each meeting minutes should be prepared 

• Mostly goal-oriented minutes (“Ergebnisprotokoll”), 

sometimes minutes specifying the discussion could be 
important as well (“Verlaufsprotokoll”) 

• Identifying precise tasks and goals 

• During the first weeks the main tasks will be to identify 

what the participants want to do during the year

GENERAL INFORMATION 

• Some further features 

• Identifying precise tasks and goals 

• Usually the participants are responsible for a precise 

specification of the content of the projects 

• This means that during the first weeks the team members 

need  

• To read a lot in order to get an overview of the possible 

accounts  

• To figure out what is of particular interest for the team 

members 

• To figure out what can be realized with limited resources and 

people 

• I will essentially supervise this process, but will often not 

strongly try to influence the participants.

GENERAL INFORMATION 

• Costs 

• Imagine this project would be carried out by a 

business company 
• Everything in a company is dependent on the amount of 

money the management has to pay 
• Here is an example of resulting costs 

• Duration of the project: 1 year = 12 months 
• Number of people participating in the project: 8 (example) 
• Number of hours people spend for the project per day: 2 
• Number of hours spent: 12 
• Number of man-days: 480 
• If you employ an external expert for 500 Euros per day 

 2   8   20 = 3840  

(cheap offer…), your total costs are approx. 240,000 Euro 

• If you employ a BCG consultant (approx. 3,000.00 Euros per 

day), your costs would be 1,440,000.00 Euros 

• The task is to realize a project that is “worth” its “virtual” 

costs

GENERAL INFORMATION 

• The idea of a study project is to prepare 

students for the task to write a Master’s thesis 
• The plan is that participants will be prepared 

to write a thesis in the field of interest

THE CONTEXT  
OF THE TOPIC 

C O M P U T A T I O N A L   C R E A T I V I T Y  

Kai-Uwe Kühnberger 

IKW, Osnabrück 

EXAMPLES 

• Idea: analogies and concept blending can be used to 

explain several abilities we would call creative.  

 Metaphors:  
“Gills are the lungs of fish.” 

“Electrons are the planets of the nucleus.” 

„Juliet is the sun.” 

According to Lakoff & Núñez (2000) 

mathematics origins from concrete domains 

of human activity (mathematical 

metaphors) 

Analogies in the Physics Domain 

Technical Concepts

EXAMPLES 

Nesting objects in (other) 
objects (nested doll 
principle) 

Nesting  
tables 

Nesting  
bowls 

Planetary gearing 

“Trojan” (computer 

virus)

FEATURES OF ANALOGIES 

• Clearly, the mentioned domains do not cover all 

creativity aspects of humans. Further (perhaps more 
classical) examples: 
• Poetry, marketing, advertising industry, theorem provers etc.

HDTP: ANTI-UNIFICATION 

 
 
 
 
 

• Anti-unification was introduced as a dual 

construction to unification by Gordon Plotkin 
(Plotkin, 1970).  

• Anti-unification constructs a generalization of two 

terms by using substitutions.  

• HDTP uses a restricted form of higher- 

order anti-unification

CONCEPTUAL BLENDING:  

HOUSE AND BOAT 

Example: semantics of “boathouse” and 
“houseboat” 

The “blend space” allows to merge 
attributes and relations from different 
concepts.  

The idea of mental spaces was 

discussed by Fauconnier & Turner, 

Gärdenfors, Rosch and others.

HDTP AND CONCEPT BLENDING 

• Concept blending in HDTP is considered as a 

second step following analogy-making.

Abdel-Fattah et al. (2012), AGI 

CONCEPT BLENDING 

•

Idea: To get an algorithmic modeling of concept 
blending, extend HDTP to theory blending. 

• Compute an analogical mapping 
(alignment) between two theories. 

• Non-matching parts of the input theories 

•

would generate inconsistencies in a blend 
space.  
These non-matching parts of the theories are 
blended according to further heuristics 
(domain-dependent): 

• Resolution of inconsistencies. 
•

Introduction of subsorts (in the math 
domain) 

• „Maximal consistent (coherent) 

coverage“ 

• …  

Kai-Uwe Kühnberger

HDTP, ANALOGIES, AND  

CONCEPT BLENDING 

• Some Challenges for this Approach:  

• The dynamic change of signatures needs to be modeled. 

• A semantics of analogy making and concept blending 

would be desirable.  

• Blending does not, so far, result in a structure that can be 

mathematically described in a reasonable way.  

• Heuristics are needed to evaluate candidate blend spaces.  

• There is no appropriate algorithmic approach of concept 

blending so far available.  

• Etc.

CONCEPT BLENDING:  
FURTHER CHALLENGES 

• Blending does not, so far, result in a structure that 

can be mathematically described in a reasonable 
way. 
• Open problem so far.  

• There is no appropriate algorithmic approach of 

concept blending so far available. 
• Open problem so far.  

• Heuristics are needed to evaluate candidate blend 

spaces. 
• We proposed some heuristics in the field of counterfactuals 

(Abdel-Fattah et al., to appear, ACS).

LAKOFF & NÚÑEZ BASIC METAPHORS 

Again Lakoff & Núñez (2000): mathematics 
origins from concrete domains of human 
activity (mathematical metaphors) 

A natural idea is to use the 

analogy engine HDTP to compute 
mathematical metaphors that are 
grounded in concrete domains of 

human activity.

EXAMPLE: LAKOFF & NÚÑEZ 

• Input: „Measuring 

stick“ metaphor and 
„Moving along a 
path“ metaphor.  

• Computation of the 

generalization 
• Generic space 

• Computation of a 

blend space, 
introducing a new 
subsort nat and 
relativized axioms.  
• Introduction of 

subsorts is heuristic-
based.

ARGAND’S COMPLEX PLANE  

Argand discovered the 
complex plane as a 
geometric interpretation of 
complex numbers in 1806 
(Argand, 1813).  
 
This discovery is rather 
explicitly described by the 
mathematician.  
 
A formalized version of 
concept blending can be 
used to compute the blend 
space.

MUSIC IN THE COINVENT PROJECT 

• Problem: How is it possible to implement a creative 

system by blending conceptual spaces that can 
produce music?  

• I think that blending can appear on different levels in 

music: 
• Harmonies can be blended (and generalized) 
• Chord progressions can be blended (and generalized) 
• Harmonization systems can be blended (and generalized) 
• Metalevel descriptions of idioms can be blended (and 

generalized) 

• Etc.  

• Probably the resulting system should work on all levels 
• Additionally: Music can be described on the 

subsymbolic and the symbolic level

(NO. 1) 

• Two cadences that are close to each other (input):  

• Input 1: T –> Tp –> Sp –> D7 –> T  
• Input 1 in C-Major: C-Major –> a-minor –> d-minor -> G-

Major7 -> C-Major 
 

• Input 2: T -> DDD -> DD -> D -> T 
• Input 2 in C-Major: C-Major -> A-Major -> D-Major -> G-Major 

-> C-Major 
 

• Interesting Blends could be:  

• Blend 1: T -> Tp -> DD -> D -> T  
• Blend 2: T -> DDD -> Sp -> D7 -> T

BLENDING OF CHORD PROGRESSIONS 

(NO. 1) 

The example ones more again in traditional notation.  
If one wants to make this example more complicated one could 
consider inversions.

BLENDING OF CHORD PROGRESSIONS 

(NO. 2) 

• Two cadences as input, which are not close to 

each other  
• Input 1: Circle of fifth: T –> S –> SS –> SSS –> S4 -> S5 -> S6 -> 

D5 -> D4 -> DDD -> DD -> D -> T  

• Input 1 in C-Major: C –> F -> Bb -> Eb -> Ab -> Db -> Gb -> B -> 

E -> A -> D -> G -> C 

 

• Input 2: T -> SS -> T -> D> -> T -> SS -> D>7 -> T  
• Input 2 in C-Major: C -> Bb -> G> (augmented dominant 

seventh chord) -> C -> Bb -> G> -> C

• Remark: Interesting could be a progression of the form:  …S4 -> 

SS -> S6 -> D7 –> T (related to a tritone substitution) 
 

• Blend 3: T -> S -> SS -> D7> -> S4 -> S5 -> D7> -> T 
• Blend 3 in C: C -> F -> Bb -> G> -> Ab -> Db -> G> -> C

BLENDING OF CHORD PROGRESSIONS 

(NO. 3) 

• Twi chord progressions which are far away from each other 

(no common function) 
Input 1: T –> S –> D –> T  
•
Input 1 in C: C –> F –> G -> C 
•
 
Input 2: t -> dP -> sP -> t 
Input 2 in c-minor: c -> Bb -> Ab -> G  
 

•
•

• Interesting Blends:  

• Blend 1: t -> S  -> D -> t (close to the beginning of Michael Jackson’s 

earth song) 

• Blend 2: t -> dp -> sP -> T  
• Blend 3: T -> S -> sP –> t  
• Blend: T -> dP -> D -> T (similarity to the chord progression of the 

Rhapsody in Blue) 

• A natural question is what are reasonable heuristics to guide the 

search 

Kai-Uwe Kühnberger 

IKW, Osnabrück 

GUIDING THE SEARCH 

• Heuristics 

• Conservative: Blend progression starts with the tonic and 

ends with the tonic 

• Progressive: chord progression starts with major / minor and 

ends with minor / major 

• Conservative: Progression in a certain region may be 

preferred. If one progresses from one region to another 
region, then the chord chosen should be close to the 
center.  
• Tonic region: T | Tp | Tg (C, a, e) 
• Subdominant region: S | Sp |  sP | SS | S^3 |… (F, s, Ab, Bb, 

Eb,…) 

• Dominant region: D | Dp | dP | DD | D^3 |… (G, e, Bb, D, A,…) 

• Progressive: Depart from the heuristics above
