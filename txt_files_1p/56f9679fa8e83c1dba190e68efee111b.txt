DEFINITIONS 

Theatre of cruelty 

A term introduced by the French actor Antonin Artaud in a series of manifestos in the 1930s, 
collected  as  Le  Théâtre  et  son  double  (1938).  It  refers  to  his  projected  revolution  in  drama, 
whereby  the  rational  ‘theatre  of  psychology’  was  to  be  replaced  by  a  more  physical  and 
primitive rite intended to shock the audience into an awareness of life's cruelty and violence. 
The  idea,  derived  partly  from  Surrealism,  was  that  the  audience  should  undergo  a  catharsis 
through  being  possessed  by  a  ‘plague’  or  epidemic  of  irrational  responses.  Artaud’s  own 
attempts to put this theory into dramatic practice failed, and he was locked up for some time 
as  a  lunatic.  Some  later  dramatists,  though,  have  developed  these  principles  more 
successfully:  a  celebrated  instance  was  Peter  Brook's  production  in  1964  of  Peter  Weiss's 
Marat/Sade. (“Theatre of cruelty”)  
 
Black Revolutionary Theatre 

The Black Revolutionary Theatre represents an attempt to racialize the Artaudian “theatre of 
cruelty” by instigating its audience to act in revolutionary and violent ways to overthrow the 
white-dominated American social order. (Piggford 75)

down in the vicinity of my ass and legs. (p. 7) 

LULA. You look like you been trying to grow a beard. That’s exactly how you look like. You 
look  like  you  live  in  New  Jersey  with  your  parents  and  are  trying  to  grow  a  beard.  That’s 
what. You look like you’ve been reading Chinese poetry and drinking lukewarm sugarless tea.

weeks ago. (p. 9)
