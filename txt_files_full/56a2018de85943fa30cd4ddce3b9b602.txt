Insights and Blindspots of the
Cognitivist Theory of Emotions

Andrea Scarantino

ABSTRACT

Philosophical cognitivists have argued for more than four decades that emotions are
special types of judgments. Anti-cognitivists have provided a series of counterexamples
aiming to show that identifying emotions with judgments overintellectualizes the emo-
tions. I provide a novel counterexample that makes the overintellectualization charge
especially vivid. I discuss neurophysiological evidence to the effect that the fear system
can be activated by stimuli the subject is unaware of seeing. To emphasize the analogy
with blindsight, I call this phenomenon blindfright. Cognitivists may reply that blind-
fright is nothing but an unconscious judgment subcortically elicited. This reply is in line
with the strategy commonly employed by cognitivists against their critics. I call it the
Elastic Strategy, because it consists of ‘stretching’ the notion of judgment in order to
accommodate counterexamples. This strategy, I argue, turns cognitivism into a theory
that is at worst unfalsiﬁable and at best trivially true. The ﬁnal portion of my article aims
to rescue cognitivism from the damage done by the Elastic Strategy. I distinguish three
varieties of cognitivism, one concerned with what emotions essentially are (Constitutive
Cognitivism), one concerned with what causes emotions (Etiological Cognitivism) and
one concerned with what emotions represent (Representational Cognitivism). I conclude
that what cognitivism has to offer to emotion theory are primarily insights concerning the
causes and representational content of emotions. The constitutive identiﬁcation of emo-
tions with judgments, on the other hand, does more harm than good.

1 Introduction

Philosophical cognitivists have long argued that emotions are special types of
judgments (Solomon [1976], [2003]; Nussbaum [2001]).1 This thesis has been
widely criticized, because judgments appear to have distinguishing properties
emotions lack (e.g., cognitive sophistication) and lack distinguishing proper-
ties emotions have (e.g., motivational power) (cf. Deigh [1994]; Grifﬁths
[1997]; DeLancey [2001]; D’Arms and Jacobson [2003]; Prinz [2004]).
Cognitivists have been largely unfazed by criticisms of this sort. Their stand-
ard reaction is to ﬁne-tune the notion of judgment, and reply that, relative to
such notion, emotions are indeed judgments. The purpose of this article is to
move beyond this standard dialectic, which mixes terminological disputes on
what judgments are with substantive disagreements on the nature of emotions.
The paper can be divided into three parts. In the ﬁrst, I present a new
counterexample to cognitivism, an emotion I call blindfright. Blindfright is a
type of fear elicited without awareness of the eliciting stimulus, in circum-
stances analogous to those in which blindsight is manifested. Besides being an
interesting phenomenon in its own right, blindfright is a striking example of
what is wrong with the identiﬁcation of emotions with judgments, under the
understanding of judgment presupposed by anti-cognitivists. Cognitivists,
however, reject such an understanding, and adopt what I call the Elastic
Strategy. The strategy consists of stretching the notion of ‘judgment’ in
order to accommodate counterexamples. Blindfright is bound to lead cogni-
tivists to add the notion of a subcortical judgment to the already motley crew of
items that qualify as judgments by cognitivists’ lights.

In the second part of my paper, I explain what is wrong with the Elastic
Strategy. In a nutshell, it has turned cognitivism into a theory that is (at best)
trivially true. Furthermore, the Elastic Strategy has led cognitivists and
anti-cognitivists to talk past each other; while they respectively afﬁrm and
deny that emotions are judgments, they mean different things by ‘judgment’.
Finally, the Elastic Strategy has prevented anti-cognitivists from gaining an
appreciation of the insights of the cognitivist research program.

In the third part of my paper, I try to rescue cognitivism from the damage
done by the Elastic Strategy. I distinguish between three varieties of cognitiv-
ism that have been historically important in philosophy and in the sciences of
mind. One is concerned with the essential nature of emotions (Constitutive

1 Other versions of cognitivism in philosophy are less radical (see, e.g., Deigh [1994] for further
discussion). Greenspan ([1998]), for example, offers a cognitivist theory that makes room for the
feeling dimension of emotions by suggesting that emotions are feelings of comfort or discomfort
towards a stimulus-directed thought. Marks ([1984]) offers a belief and desire theory which
makes room for the motivational dimension of emotions, proposing that an emotion results
from the conjunction of a belief and a strong desire. I will disregard varieties of philosophical
cognitivism distinct from pure judgmentalism in what follows.

Cognitivism), one with the cause of emotions (Etiological Cognitivism), and
one with the representational content of emotions
(Representational
Cognitivism). This richer taxonomy will allow me to distinguish the genuine
insights of cognitivism from some of its ﬂaws or blindspots.

Here is how I will proceed. I begin with a brief history of the cognitivist
theory of emotions (Section 2). Next, I discuss the scientiﬁc evidence for
blindfright (Section 3), and show how blindfright can ground a new argument
against cognitivism (Section 4). I then illustrate the Elastic Strategy cognitiv-
ists have developed to respond to counterexamples, and explain what is wrong
with it (Section 5). Finally, I assess three cognitivist theses about the essence,
cause and representational content of emotions (Section 6).

2 The Emergence of Cognitivism

The current form of the cognitivist theory of emotions emerged in philosophy
in the 1970s and 1980s as an alternative to feeling theories of emotion.2
At the time, the most popular feeling theory was still William James’
([1884], [1890]), according to which emotions are feelings, understood as per-
ceptions of autonomic bodily changes. What is left of fear, James famously
asked, when we subtract from it the bodily changes that typically characterize
it, such as heightened heart beats, trembling, sweaty palms, and so on? His
answer was: nothing at all, because fear, just like every other emotion, is
essentially the feeling generated by perceiving a suite of autonomic bodily
changes.

The cognitivists begged to differ. Firstly, they argued, emotions sometimes
do not involve feelings at all. As ﬁrst emphasized by behaviorists such as
Watson ([1913], [1925]), Skinner ([1953]) and Ryle ([1949/1990]), emotion
terms sometimes refer to dispositions to behave. Love for one’s long-term
partner, for instance, can be instantiated by virtue of a disposition to
behave in loving ways towards such partner, rather than by virtue of any
occurrent feeling of love. One may bracket dispositional emotions as a special
case, or argue that they still involve, perhaps necessarily, dispositions to per-
ceive autonomic bodily changes (Prinz [2004]). The trouble is that even non-
dispositional emotions sometimes do not seem to involve the perception of
autonomic bodily changes.

2 Cognitivism broadly understood also counts representatives in psychology (e.g., Arnold [1960];
Schachter and Singer [1962]; Lazarus [1991]; Ortony et al. [1988]). As I argue in Section 6.2,
psychological cognitivism is different from philosophical cognitivism in that it only aims to
identify the cognitive causes of emotions, without assuming that such causes identify what
emotions essentially are.

Consider the sort of unconscious emotions dynamic psychotherapy tries to
unveil, say fear of failing in life, hatred for a dependent parent, or envy to-
wards a more successful sibling. The emoter is unable to report that she is
undergoing them, yet their ascription appears to explain a wide range of be-
haviors. It appears quite possible that such emotions may be instantiated
without the perception of any autonomic bodily changes. One may respond
by calling into question the very construct of unconscious emotion
(Hatzimoysis [2007]), or by allowing perceptions of bodily changes to be un-
conscious (Damasio [1994], [1999]). Counterexamples, however, keep coming.
Consider what we may call calm emotions, namely garden variety emotions
which are conscious and occurrent, but ‘more known by their effects than by
the immediate feeling or sensation’ (Hume [1739/1992], p. 471). Examples
may include delight at the sight of art work (which may lead you to buy it),
fear that a certain politician will win the elections (which may lead you to vote
for his opponent), anger at the injustices of the world (which may lead you to
donate to Oxfam), or guilt about having missed a friend’s birthday (which
may lead you to make an apologetic phone call). It seems that one could
undergo such emotions in a genuine sense, but in the absence of any perceiv-
able autonomic bodily changes. If this is the case, emotions cannot be essen-
tially perceptions of autonomic bodily changes.3

Cognitivists had a further worry with respect to the feeling theory. They
argued that feelings are not normatively assessable the way emotions are.
Anthony Kenny emphasized one dimension of normative assessment in par-
ticular: ‘If the emotions were internal impressions [i.e. feelings] [ . . .] there
would be no logical restrictions on the type of object which each emotion
could have [ . . .] In fact, each emotion is appropriate—logically, and not
just morally appropriate—only to certain restricted objects’ (Kenny [1963],
p. 192). Kenny labeled these restricted objects formal objects, distinguishing
them from the material objects of the emotion. Whereas ‘anything which can
be ed is a material object of ing’, he wrote, the ‘formal object of ing is the
object under that description which must apply to it if it is to be possible to  it’
(Kenny [1963], p. 189).

3 A standard attempt to incorporate calm emotions within the purview of the feeling theory of
emotions is to propose, as Neo-Jamesians do, that autonomic bodily changes need not be actual,
but only mirrored by the differential activation of the somatosensory brain regions which are
responsible for autonomic bodily changes (Damasio [1999] calls these ‘as if’ bodily changes). It
is an open question whether emotions always differentially activate somatosensory regions. The
current evidence is inconclusive (see Barrett and Wager [2006] for a review). If it turned out that
they do, the thesis that emotions are essentially perceptions of autonomic bodily changes would
hold in such watered down form that many radical anti-feeling theorists would happily endorse
it. This is to say that after a certain number of reﬁnements, the notion of perception of bodily
changes becomes so broad that all distinctions between opposing camps get lost. For a different
contemporary version of the feeling theory, see (Robinson [2004]).

Cognitivist Theory of Emotions

733

For instance, whereas the material object of anger may be any speciﬁc object
(one’s girlfriend), event (the event of being called a jerk) or state of affairs (the
state of affairs constituted by the inequitable distribution of wealth) one is
angry about, the formal object of anger is that description of the material
object which must be true of it in order for anger to be appropriately instan-
tiated (we can think of the formal object of anger as an offence of some kind).
Material and formal objects constitute two aspects of the intentionality of
emotions. According to the picture advanced by Kenny ([1963]), emotions
are about material objects and they are about formal objects.

A standard move in the philosophy of emotions (e.g., Prinz [2004]; Salmela
[2006]) is to describe formal objects in terms of what Lazarus ([1991]) labelled
core relational themes. I will follow this practice and adopt the following
working taxonomy of formal objects.4

Emotion 

Sadness 

Anger 

Fear 

Guilt 

Shame 

Pride 

Formal Object

Having experienced an irrevocable loss 

A demeaning offense against me and mine 

Danger 

Having transgressed a moral imperative 

Failing to live up to an ego ideal 
Enhancement of one’s ego identity by taking credit for a 
valued object or achievement, either one’s own or that of 
someone or group with whom we identify 

Figure 1. Examples of characteristic formal objects for some common emotions

On this view, whereas one can in principle be sad, or angry, or afraid, or
guilty, or ashamed, or proud about anything, each of these emotions is logic-
ally appropriate, to use Kenny’s expression, only when the material objects of
these emotions constitute, respectively, a loss, an offence, a danger, a moral
transgression, a failure to live up to an ego ideal, and an enhancement of one’s
ego identity.

The difﬁculties encountered by the feeling theory eventually led to the emer-
gence of cognitivism. In its most paradigmatic formulation, the positive thesis

4

I consider the description of core relational themes provided by Lazarus ([1991]) to be highly
perfectible. But to provide a better account is not a job for this article. What matters for my
purposes is that there exist good descriptions of formal objects, roughly approximated by
Lazarus’ ([1991]) preliminary descriptions. On this issue, see also (D’Arms and Jacobson [2003]).

of cognitivism in philosophy is that emotions are judgments.5 ‘I still hold the
claim that emotions are judgments’, states Solomon ([2003], p. 210).
Nussbaum ([2001], p. 4) writes that ‘[e]motions are appraisals or value judg-
ments’. The following passage illustrates what kinds of judgments emotions
are supposed to be:

‘I am angry at John for taking [ . . .] my car’ entails that I believe that John
has somehow wronged me [ . . .] My anger is that judgment [ . . .] If I do not
ﬁnd my situation awkward, I cannot be ashamed [ . . . ] If I do not judge
that I have suffered a loss, I cannot be sad [ . . . ] to have an emotion is to
hold a normative judgment about one’s situation (Solomon [2003], p. 8)

Solomon’s ([2003]) suggestion is that anger is the judgment that a demean-
ing offence against me and mine has been perpetrated, shame is the judgment
that I failed to live up to an ego ideal, sadness is the judgment that I have
experienced an irrevocable loss, fear is the judgment that something danger-
ous is present, guilt is the judgment that I transgressed a moral imperative, and
so on.6

The thesis that emotions are judgments in this sense seemed to provide a
solution to the perceived problems of the feeling theory. Firstly, in the absence
of perceptions of autonomic bodily changes, emotions can still be instantiated
as long as the appropriate judgments are instantiated. Second, judgments
seem to make sense of the intentionality of emotions. If my anger that John
took my car amounts to my judgment that John’s taking my car is an offence
against me or mine, then my anger is about whatever my judgment is about:
John’s taking my car (material object) and an offence against me or mine
(formal object).

In light of these comparative advantages, the cognitivist theory of emotions
soon became very popular. The success of cognitivism, however, has not gone
unchallenged.

3 Blindfright

The rallying cry of the anti-cognitivism movement is that the assimilation of
emotions with judgments overintellectualizes the emotions. My ﬁrst objective
is to give the overintellectualization charge the best run for its money. In this
section, I present a new counterexample to cognitivism consisting of a case of
fear elicited without so much as awareness of the eliciting stimulus. I expect
cognitivists to ﬁnd my counterexample inconclusive. But this is precisely the

5 This is the version of cognitivism I call Constitutive Cognitivism. In Section 6, I will discuss

other varieties of cognitivism.
I used Lazarus’ ([1991]) descriptions of core relational themes instead of Solomon’s original ones.

problem. If even fear without awareness of what one is afraid of qualiﬁes as a
judgment, hardly anything will convince a cognitivist that there exist emotions
that are not judgments. This will lead me to argue that the standard argumen-
tative strategy put in place to explain away counterexamples amounts to a
pyrrhic victory for cognitivism.

Anti-cognitivists have often considered the fact that emotions can be trig-
gered quickly and automatically to be a problem for cognitivism. As James
put it, ‘[i]f we abruptly see a dark moving form in the woods, our heart stops
beating, and we catch our breath instantly and before any articulate idea of
danger can arise’ (James [1884], p. 196). Cognitivists have responded to this
sort of criticism by pointing out that judgments can also be triggered quickly
and automatically. For instance, the judgment that setting a human being on
ﬁre is wrong can be elicited as quickly and automatically as fear of a dark
moving form in the woods.

I want to push the standard anti-cognitivist line one step further, and argue
that fear can be triggered not only quickly and automatically, but also by
stimuli emoters are unaware of seeing.7 This presents cognitivism with a po-
tentially harder case to handle. What is missing in the sort of fear I describe is
not just the laborious cognitive processing of fearful objects of awareness (the
‘dark moving form in the woods’ case). More radically, it is the very presence
of awareness of fearful objects.

Let blindfright be the activation of the fear system in response to visually
presented information registered without awareness. I understand awareness
as the ability to make a verbal report in forced choice situations. Registering
visually presented information without awareness is therefore registering in-
formation through the sense of vision without being able to report on the
information registered even when forced to guess. I picked the word ‘blind-
fright’ to emphasize that what is being elicited is a variety of fear in circum-
stances analogous to those in which blindsight is manifested (see below).8

Fear is a member of the family of basic emotions, biologically based and
pan-cultural suites of short-term, coordinated, and automated responses that
include measurable physiological changes, stereotyped facial expressions, and
action tendencies (Ekman [1999]; Grifﬁths [1997]).9 Unlike other basic

7

I want to thank an anonymous referee for pressing me to emphasize the differences between
merely automatic emotions and the affective phenomenon I describe below.

8 Blindfright is not really a kind of fright, i.e., intense fear. The terminological imprecision of
calling a form of fairly mild fear (blind)fright is a price worth paying in order to emphasize the
important analogies between blindfright and blindsight.

9 There are forms of fear which do not ﬁt the ‘basic emotion’ paradigm. For instance, fear that one
will lose a chess match, progressively developed in the course of the game and lasting for several
hours would not qualify as a basic emotion.

emotions, fear is fairly well understood at the neurobiological level (LeDoux
[1996]; Davis [2000]). For instance, it has consistently been reported that
fear-relevant stimuli generate differential amygdala activation (Aggleton
[1992]; Adolphs et al. [2005]; Barrett et al. [2007]).10 It has also been convin-
cingly argued that there are dedicated neural pathways for at least some forms
of fear (Le Doux [1996]).

For purposes of scientiﬁc investigation, the category of basic fear is still too
broad. Fear scientists distinguish between different forms of fear associated
with the detection of different degrees of threat imminence. Fanselow ([1994]),
for
instance, distinguished between preencounter, postencounter and
circa-strike fear, characterized by partially distinct physiological proﬁles.
Preencounter fear is the sort of fear a prey animal experiences when foraging
for food in an area where a predator has attacked in the past. The environment
is continuously scanned, skin conductance responses (SCRs) increase, heart
rate (HR) decreases, and orienting behaviors are manifested. When the pres-
ence of an actual predator is registered, postencounter fear ensues, character-
ized by further increase of SCRs, decrease of HR, emergence of a potentiated
startle reﬂex and of a freezing behavioral response. When the predator ﬁnally
attacks, the sympathetic nervous system takes over, SCRs and HRs show a
dramatic boost, and the prey animal displays the ﬁght-or-ﬂight behaviors
commonly associated with fear.

Here is the key point: enhanced SCRs, potentiated startle reﬂex and differ-
ential amygdala activation can be elicited by visual stimuli registered without
awareness. This is to say that there is such a thing as blindfright: subjects can
register fear-relevant properties of a stimulus and become afraid of it without
being aware of seeing it, just as in blindsight one can register the color and
shape of a stimulus without being aware of seeing it.

Blindfright has been detected in both normal subjects and brain-damaged
patients. This is important, because it suggests that the phenomenon is not
simply a by-product of a dysfunctional vision system. The experimental set-
ting that applies to normal subjects is that of backward masking experiments
(Marcel [1983]), where a target stimulus and a masking stimulus are presented
in rapid succession. When the interval between the two presentations is 30 ms
or less, the masking stimulus masks the target stimulus entirely. In response
to questions, normal subjects report that they are not aware of being exposed
to the masked visual stimulus, and perform at chance level when forced to
guess.

The second experimental setting concerns patients with damaged primary
visual cortex. As it is widely known, some such patients maintain an

10 Fear is not the only emotion to produce differential amygdala activation. See (Whalen and
Phelps [2009]) for a state-of-the-art account of the role of the human amygdala in emotional
processing.

impressive range of abilities with respect to force-guessing the position, color,
shape, and orientation of visual stimuli in their blindﬁeld (Weiskrantz [1986];
Stoerig and Cowey [1997]). In the last few years, a whole new range of residual
affective abilities has been discovered in blindsighted patients.11

What is emerging from this converging body of research is that fear can be
elicited both when normal subjects are exposed to masked fear-relevant sti-
muli and when brain-damaged patients are exposed to fear-relevant stimuli in
their blindﬁeld. For example, it has been demonstrated that a snake-phobic
subject exposed to masked pictures of snakes produces enhanced SCRs,
whereas this effect does not occur with neutral stimuli (O¨ hman and Soares
[1993]).12 In addition, a normal subject who acquired a conditioned fear re-
sponse to images of spiders, snakes and threatening faces will also maintain
enhanced SCRs to such images when masked (Esteves et al. [1994]; O¨ hman
and Soares [1998]). Furthermore, subjects who have acquired a conditioned
fear response to images of angry faces show amygdala activation under mask-
ing, whereas in the absence of fear-conditioning the same masked angry faces
produce no amygdala activation (Morris et al. [1999]). Amygdala activation is
also detected when subjects are exposed to masked fearful faces, whereas
masked happy faces do not have a differential impact on the amygdala
(Whalen et al.
[1998]). Finally, subjects can acquire a conditioned fear
response—as revealed by enhanced SCRs—to masked images of spiders,
snakes and threatening faces (Esteves et al. [1994]; O¨ hman and Soares [1998]).
These results are nicely complemented by ﬁndings on patients with
damaged primary visual cortex. These patients show amygdala activation
when an angry face to which they have been fear conditioned is presented in
their blindﬁeld, but no such activation is detected with respect to the same
‘unseen’ angry faces in the absence of conditioning (Morris et al. [2001]).
Similarly, amygdala activation is detected when fearful faces are presented
in the blindﬁeld, an effect disappearing when happy faces are shown instead
(Morris et al. [2001]). An especially interesting experiment concerned a patient
with Anton’s syndrome, the combination of bilateral blindsight with agnosia.
The patient ‘was unable to grasp objects held into his visual ﬁeld and did not
orient to new visual stimuli, even when asked to do so’ (Hamm et al. [2003],
p. 269). Despite failing to manifest the abilities commonly displayed by blind-
sighted patients, the patient did acquire a conditioned fear response—as re-
vealed by a potentiated startle reﬂex—to a neutral stimulus, i.e., the image of

11 De Gelder et al. ([1999]) refer to this body of literature with the term ‘affective blindsight’, to
indicate that the experimental conditions are similar to those of blindsight, but the abilities
detected are affective in nature.

12 Altered SCRs, potentiated startle reﬂex, and altered HR are considered to be the main physio-
logical changes characterizing fear. See (O¨ hman and Wiens [2003]) for a defense of this view.

an airplane, visually presented in his bilaterally blind ﬁeld (Hamm et al.
[2003]).

The experiments on masked and blind exposure to fear-relevant stimuli
seem to me to provide strong support for the thesis that the fear system can
be activated by means of information acquired visually, but without aware-
ness. A few objections, however, could be raised against this interpretation.
The ﬁrst may be that blindfright is not really fear because there is no dis-
tinctive phenomenology attached to it. On this view, blindfright is a set of
neurophysiological responses similar to those of fear, but it is not really fear.
My ﬁrst response is that it is not clear that blindfright lacks a phenomenology
entirely. Experimenters have generally not reported data on the subjective
experience associated with being mask exposed or blind-exposed to fear-
relevant stimuli. This being said, the limited data available suggest that ex-
perimental subjects may become aware of being afraid, without being aware of
the reason why they are afraid. For instance, after exposure to masked images
of the objects of their phobias, phobic subjects in (O¨ hman and Soares [1993])
state they feel high arousal, high disliking, and lack of control. Notably, the way
phobics rate their feelings on the arousal/disliking/control scale when
exposed to, respectively, unmasked and masked phobic images are very similar.
In the masked case, bodily feedback presumably informs them that their
bodies are primed to deal with a threat they are unaware of.

My second response is that, even if there is nothing it is like to undergo
blindfright (at least on some occasions), lack of phenomenology does not
necessarily entail lack of emotion. To think otherwise is to subscribe to
what is at this point a minority view on the relation between emotion and
feeling. Most leading theories of emotions—e.g. cognitivism, affect program
theory, Neo-Jamesianism—now allow for the possibility that some instances
of emotion may have no experiential qualities. If this is right, blindfright can
still qualify as a genuine form of fear in the absence of blindfright qualia,
provided it fulﬁls properties of fear other than its characteristic phenomen-
ology.13

A second objection is that blindfright not only lacks a phenomenology, but
it also lacks other key properties of prototypical fear episodes. This may be
another reason to think that blindfright has some similarities with fear, but is
not really fear. The objection presupposes that the instantiation of emotions

13 To conclude that blindfright is not a form of fear because it lacks a phenomenology would be
like concluding that blindsight is not a form of sight because it lacks a phenomenology. In both
cases, an opportunity to study what happens to mental states when conscious experience and
ecological function come apart would be lost. As there is more to sight than what it is like to see,
there is more to fear than what it is like to fear, namely a danger-detecting and danger-coping
role.

commonly involves many, if not all, of their prototypical properties. On this
view, fear episodes involve a suite of coordinated neurophysiological, phe-
nomenological, and behavioral responses. On the contrary, emotion scientists
have argued that ‘behavioral and physiological measurements in emotion
often bear little relationship to each other, and are in turn poorly correlated
with a verbal report of the subjective state’ (Lang [1993], p. 18). In other
words, the degree to which the prototypical neurophysiological, phenomeno-
logical, and behavioral responses of an emotion are co-instantiated is signiﬁ-
cantly lower than our pre-theoretic intuitions would suggest (Barrett [2006]).
The instantiation of an emotion by virtue of a small subset of its prototypical
characteristics is the norm rather than the exception.14

The point is that the characteristics of blindfright are remarkably similar to
those of one of the scientiﬁc explications of fear, namely postencounter fear
(Fanselow [1994]). Just like postencounter fear, blindfright is characterized by
differential amygdala activation, enhanced SCRs and potentiated startle ac-
tivation.15 It would be inconsistent to deny that blindfright is a form of fear
while holding that postencounter fear is a form of fear. And to deny the latter
because postencounter fear differs from a prototypical fear episode would
amount to allowing ordinary intuitions about prototypical fear episodes to
set the boundaries for the scientiﬁc exploration of fear. As convincingly
argued by Grifﬁths ([1997]), emotion theory should not be hostage of ordinary
language intuitions about the extension of emotion terms. The dissimilarity of
postencounter fear (and blindfright) from prototypical fear episodes is not a
good reason to conclude that emotion scientists, who routinely refer to post-
encounter fear and what I have called blindfright as instances of fear, are either
not speaking literally, or have changed the subject.16

14 A pathological example of poor correlation between physiological, behavioral, and verbal
indexes is offered by patients afﬂicted by alexithymia (Lane et al. [1997]). Such patients are
systematically unable to report on how they feel, failing to distinguish whether they feel, say,
afraid or angry, even though they display physiological and behavioral manifestations charac-
teristic of, respectively, fear or anger. I mention alexithymia because Lane et al. ([1997]) claim
that it may be the ‘emotional equivalent of blindsight’. The analogy is very thin, because
alexythimics are unaware of their emotions, whereas it is an open question whether blindfright
subjects are similarly unaware. More importantly, there isn’t any similarity between the circum-
stances of elicitation of alexythimia and blindsight, whereas there is remarkable similarity be-
tween the circumstances of elicitation of blindsight and blindfright. The emotional equivalent of
blindsight, I suggest, is blindfright rather than alexithymia.

15 I am not aware of data concerning the behavioral changes associated with blindfright. This
being said, it is likely that a subject who describes her feelings in terms of high arousal, high
disliking, and lack of control (O¨ hman and Soares [1993]) will manifest behavioral changes. My
prediction is that experimental subjects will show orienting behaviors and possibly the beginning
of a freezing response, even though these responses are likely to be weaker than the ones shown
in postencounter fear with respect to ‘seen’ stimuli.

16 A further possible objection, recently presented by Starkey ([2007]), is that the conditions of
elicitation of the experiments on emotional triggering without awareness are artiﬁcial, and
consequently not relevant to ﬁgure out what emotions are like in cases in which they fulﬁll
their proper functions. I disagree that experimental circumstances creating unusual eliciting

I conclude that blindfright, despite its differences from a prototypical fear
episode, is indeed a form of fear. If so, it can qualify as a counterexample to
the cognitivist theory of emotions.

4 The Master Argument Against Cognitivism

A great many counterexamples to cognitivism are best understood as substi-
tution instances of what I call the Master Argument Against Cognitivism:

(1) For all p, judging that p presupposes that the judger satisﬁes re-
quirements R1, . . ., Rn

(2) One can have emotion E without satisfying requirements R1, . . ., Rn

Therefore,

(3) To have emotion E is not necessarily to judge that p

Premise (1) determines a set of requirements for the activity of formulating
judgments. Premise (2) provides an example of an emotion E instantiated in
violation of such requirements. The conclusion is that E is not necessarily a
judgment that something is the case: there are tokens of emotion E that are not
judgments. Notice that anti-cognitivists do not need to show that no emotions
are judgments. Since cognitivism aims to tell us what all emotions are like,
anti-cognitivists only need one counterexample. Over the last forty years, the
debate between cognitivists and anti-cognitivists has focused on whether the
Master Argument Against Cognitivism is sound once we ﬂesh it out with
speciﬁc propositions p, requirements R1, . . ., Rn and emotions E.

Premise (1) has turned out to be the most contentious. Anti-cognitivists
generally endorse a conservative understanding of judgment, according to
which judging is engaging in a mental operation of assent with respect to a
proposition p. The historical origin of this understanding of judgment can be
traced back to the Stoic distinction between an impression (phantasia), a
seeming that something is the case, and a judgment (krisis), a mental act of
taking something to be the case (Sorabji [2000]). Whereas children, animals
and adult humans are all capable of experiencing impressions, the Stoics
argued, only human adults can judge, because judging requires the capacity

conditions for emotions do not shed light on what emotions are like in functionally normal
eliciting conditions. The point of the experimental setting is precisely to bring up features of
emotional processing which are hard to notice in normal cases, for instance that awareness of
the stimuli can only explain part of the mechanism of emotional elicitation, since the emotion is
triggered even without awareness. Moreover, even artiﬁcial eliciting conditions should count
towards falsifying a theory aiming to describe what all emotions are like, without restrictions on
their circumstances of elicitation. Insofar as blindfright counts as an emotion, a point Starkey
([2007]) would presumably not contest, we can use it as a counterexample against theories which
aim to ﬁll in the blank in universal statements such as ‘for all emotions x, x is___’.

to assent (or withhold assent) to impressions which only comes with the fac-
ulty of reason (logos) (Sorabji [2000]).17 For instance, one may have the visual
impression that two lines have different length in a Mu¨ ller-Lyer illusion, but
refrain from judging that they have different length, because assent to the
visual impression is withheld in light of background knowledge.

There are a number of distinctions between proponents of the conservative
understanding of judgment that I won’t get into. For my purposes, the con-
servative understanding of judgment can be broadly characterized by the as-
sumptions that a judgment that p (a) is an expression of linguistic abilities, (b)
presupposes conscious assent to p, (c) requires possession of the concepts
featured in p18 and it (d) affects behavior through practical reasoning by
being combined with conative attitudes (Searle [1983]).19

If ‘judgment’ is understood along these lines, blindfright is a spectacular
counterexample to cognitivism, because it appears to have none of the marks
commonly associated with the conservative understanding of judgment. Far
from being an expression of the truth-aiming linguistic ability to give or with-
hold conscious assent to concept-involving propositions, blindfright is an ex-
pression of the neural architecture of the fear system. There is growing
evidence that some forms of fear rely on a quick and dirty neural pathway
which by-passes the neo-cortex, projecting directly from the sensory cortex to
the amygdala (LeDoux [1996]). Blindfright is likely to exploit such a pathway,
the existence of which provides anatomical evidence that there are forms of
fear, and consequently emotion, which do not presuppose any of the neo-
cortical capacities associated with the conservative notion of judgment (e.g.,
language mastery, consciousness, concept possession, practical reasoning,
etc.).

Blindfright, I conclude, represents a new substitution instance of the Master

Argument Against Cognitivism:

(1) Judging that danger is at hand presupposes language mastery, con-
scious assent, the possession of the concept of danger, and the ability
to engage in practical inferences involving the danger concept.

17 The Stoics thought that logos is acquired by humans at the age of fourteen (Sorabji [2000]).
18 A common way to cash out the notion of concept possession is offered by Gareth Evans’ ([1982])
Generality Constraint. According to this constraint, a subject S can be credited with possession
of an object concept ‘a’ and of property concept ‘P’ insofar as S can exercise a and P in thought by
entertaining, respectively, indeﬁnitely many propositions of the form Pa, Qa, Ra for any prop-
erty P, Q, R, . . . the subject can conceive of, and indeﬁnitely many propositions of the form Pa,
Pb, Pc for any object a, b, c, . . . the subject can conceive of.

19 For instance, the judgment that Paris is the capital of France may lead one to going to Paris if
combined with the desire to go to the capital of France, but it may lead one to refraining from
going to Paris if combined with the desire to stay away from all European capitals. I will come
back to the distinction between cognitive and conative attitudes in Section 6.3.

(2) Blindfright is a form of fear which does not presuppose either lan-
guage mastery, or conscious assent, or the possession of the concept
of danger, or the ability to engage in practical inferences involving
the danger concept.

Therefore,

(3) Fear is not necessarily the judgment that danger is at hand.

The argument is valid, so I expect cognitivists to call its soundness into
question. One option would be to reject premise (2), and argue either that
blindfright is not fear, or that blindfright does presuppose the abilities listed in
premise (2). Arguing that blindfright is not really fear is not a viable strategy,
for reasons I considered in Section 3. Arguing that blindfright presupposes
language mastery, conscious assent, concept possession, and the ability to
engage in practical inferences strikes me as an equally hopeless strategy.
There is no evidence that the neo-cortex, with which such abilities are asso-
ciated, plays any role in the elicitation of blindfright.

This leaves open to the cognitivist camp a second option: to deny premise
(1). A cognitivist may propose that, relative to a more liberal understanding of
judgment, blindfright is the judgment that danger is at hand. The cognitivist
may ask: Why shouldn’t we think of blindfright as a nonlinguistic, uncon-
scious assent to the proposition that danger is present, relax our requirements
on concept possession and accept that a judgment can be intrinsically motiv-
ational? On this view, blindfright is nothing more than an interesting example
of how the judgment that something is dangerous can go subcortical. What
neurobiologists have discovered, the cognitivist may suggest, is not that cog-
nitivism is a ﬂawed theory of the emotions, but rather that the judgment that
danger is at hand can be formulated without relying on any of the abilities
associated with the neo-cortex.

5 The Elastic Strategy

The strategy of ﬁne-tuning the notion of ‘judgment’ has been the standard
strategy employed to protect cognitivism from counterexamples. I call it the
Elastic Strategy, to emphasize that the conservative notion of judgment
described in the previous section is progressively ‘stretched’ to accommodate
counterexamples. The failure to explain what is wrong with the Elastic
Strategy strikes me as a central weakness of the anti-cognitivist movement.
I intend to remedy it in two steps. Firstly, I provide textual evidence that the
Elastic Strategy is the key tool developed by cognitivists to reject substitution
instances of the Master Argument Against Cognitivism. Second, I argue that
the Elastic Strategy makes cognitivism at best trivially true, and at worst
unfalsiﬁable. To appreciate the extent to which the notion of ‘judgment’ has

been stretched in order to deal with counterexamples, let us consider a roster
of ﬁve inﬂuential anti-cognitivist arguments:20

(1) Animals and infants can have emotions, but they do not have the
language mastery required for giving or withholding assent to the
impression that something is the case. Therefore, emotions are not
judgments.

(2) Emotions often display a distinctive bodily phenomenology, but
there is no distinctive way it is like to judge that something is the
case. Therefore, emotions are not judgments.

(3) Emotions are causally efﬁcacious on their own, whereas judgments
need to be accompanied by a desire in order to impact behavior.
Therefore, emotions are not judgments.

(4) Emotions can be elicited unconsciously and without deliberation,
whereas judgments are deliberate and conscious. Therefore, emo-
tions are not judgments

(5) Emotions can be insensitive to judgments about what it is the case,
whereas judgments are sensitive to other judgments about what is the
case. Therefore, emotions are not judgments.

Argument (1) moves from the realization that creatures without language
emote, from which it follows that emotions cannot be judgments, if judgments
presuppose language mastery. The cognitivist reply to (1) is to afﬁrm that
judgments do not require language mastery. Solomon ([2003], p. 187), for
instance, writes: ‘I take it as uncontroversial that animals make all sorts of
judgments (e.g., whether something is worth eating, or worth chasing, or worth
courting), but none of these are articulated or “spelled out”, nor are they
subject to reﬂection’. Nussbaum ([2001], p. 37), who begins from a general
endorsement of the Stoic account of judgment according to which ‘a judgment
is an assent to an appearance’, ends up liberalizing the notion of assent to
accommodate the case of nonlinguistic (and prelinguistic) creatures: ‘When
we understand assent in [a] broader way [ . . . ] we [. . .] will ultimately be able
to ascribe emotions to young children and nonhuman animals, who, to a
greater or lesser extent, lack the capacity to withhold assent from the appear-
ances with which life confronts. Whenever they accept a way the world seems
as the way it is, they can be said to have judgment in my sense’ (pp. 38–9).

Argument (2) moves from the realization that emotions often involve
distinctive bodily feelings, from which it follows that emotions cannot
be judgments, if judgments do not have a distinctive bodily phenomenology.

20 See (De Sousa [1987]; Greenspan [1988]; Deigh [1994]; Grifﬁths [1997]; Goldie [2000]; DeLancey
[2001]; D’Arms and Jacobson [2003]; Roberts [2003]; Robinson [2004]; Prinz [2004]) for more
extended discussions of the various arguments.

The cognitivist reply to (2) is to afﬁrm that judgments can encompass a dis-
tinctive bodily phenomenology. The most striking formulation of this point
can be found in Solomon, who writes that ‘[o]ne can, and sometimes must,
speak of bodily judgments’ (Solomon [2003], p. 213). Nussbaum ([2001], p. 45)
echoes this position: ‘I am conceiving of judging as dynamic, not static [. . .] So
why would such a dynamic faculty be unable to house, as well, the disorderly
motions of [emotion]?’. The disorderly motions of emotion Nussbaum refers
to are what the Stoics called the ‘movements of the soul’, which included
contractions and expansions, to be understood as physiological discharges
and bodily sensations (Cooper [1999], pp. 453–61).

Argument (3) moves from the realization that emotions have a constitutive
motivational dimension, from which it follows that emotions cannot be judg-
ments, if judgments lack a constitutive motivational dimension. The cognitivist
reply to (3) is to afﬁrm that judgments can have a constitutive motivational
dimension. Solomon is once again the most explicit on this matter. He writes
that ‘judgments in emotions are judgments which have a quasi conceptual
connection with desires’, adding that ‘one might analyze the various emotions
as judgmental structures enclosing a core desire which is both their motivation
and their “conatus” ’ (Solomon [2003], pp. 105–6). The idea here is that the
sorts of judgments which emotions are always come accompanied by a
desire—hence the quasi-conceptual connection—which takes care of the mo-
tivational aspect of emotions.

Argument (4) moves from the realization that emotions can be elicited un-
consciously and without deliberation, from which it follows that emotions
cannot be judgments, if judgments are deliberate and conscious. The cognitivist
reply to (4) is to afﬁrm that judgments can also be nondeliberate and uncon-
scious. According to Solomon, judgments are not ‘necessarily conscious or
deliberative or even articulate’ (Solomon [2003], p. 210). Nussbaum points
out that assent to an impression ‘is not to be imagined as an act that we
always deliberately perform’ ([2001], p. 38) and emphasizes that by calling
her theory of emotions cognitive ‘I do not mean to imply the presence of
elaborate calculation, of computation, or even of reﬂexive self-awareness’
([2001], p. 23).

Argument (5) moves from the realization that emotions are sometimes cog-
nitively impenetrable, namely not sensitive to judgments about what is the
case, from which it follows that emotions cannot be judgments, if judgments
are not cognitively impenetrable. The cognitivist reply to (5) is to afﬁrm that
judgments can also be cognitively impenetrable. Nussbaum ([2001], p. 35)
acknowledges that ‘[i]t appears that people sometimes change their minds
about the beliefs that underlie their emotions, but continue to have the emo-
tions nonetheless’. She gives the example of Sandra, who used to be ‘terriﬁed
by a dog during childhood’, and subsequently learns that ‘dogs are no

danger to her well being’, while nonetheless still being afraid of them.
Anti-cognitivists take this to show that fear is not the judgment that danger
is at hand, because the emotion can co-exist with the judgment that danger is
not at hand. Nussbaum, on the other hand, argues that examples such as the
one of Sandra ‘do not support such a conclusion, for the simple reason that we
often hold contradictory beliefs’ ([2001], p. 35). Under this view, Sandra holds
two contradictory beliefs, one that dogs are not dangerous (when asked to
assent to the proposition) and the other than dogs are dangerous (when inter-
acting with dogs).

The point of this roster of anti-cognitivist arguments and cognitivist rebut-
tals is to show that the Elastic Strategy is indeed the primary tool used by
cognitivists to defend their theory from counterexamples. In general terms, the
Elastic Strategy works as follows. The anti-cognitivist brings up a property P
that emotions have (e.g., being causally efﬁcacious, as per argument (3)) and
judgments conservatively understood lack, or a property Q that judgments
conservatively understood have (e.g., requiring language possession, as per
argument (1)) and emotions lack. On this basis, the anti-cognitivist concludes
that emotions are not judgments, and that cognitivism is therefore falsiﬁed as
a general theory of emotions. The Elastic Strategy consists of arguing that,
under a liberal understanding of judgment, judgments also have property P
(they can be causally efﬁcacious, as per Solomon’s reply to argument (3)), or
lack property Q (they do not require language possession, as per Nussbaum’s
reply to argument (1)).

Crucially, the addition of property P and the subtraction of property Q do
not derive from a preexisting theory of judgment. Rather, they are offered in a
piecemeal fashion in response to anti-cognitivist pressures, with the only jus-
tiﬁcation that the notion of ‘judgment’ is allegedly ﬂexible enough to allow for
them. As Solomon puts it, ‘[j]udgments seem to me to be, all in all, the most
versatile candidate in the cognitive analysis of emotion’ ([2003], p. 188). The
versatility at hand amounts to the ability to acquire whatever property P
emotions may be found to have and lose whatever property Q emotions
may be found to lack while still qualifying as a judgment.

There are two main problems with the Elastic Strategy. The ﬁrst is that it
has generated a massive amount of talking at cross purposes between cogni-
tivists and anti-cognitivists, who have gone back and forth for decades re-
spectively afﬁrming and denying that emotions are judgments while meaning
different things by ‘judgment’. This impasse can be exempliﬁed in miniature
form with respect to blindfright. Relative to the conservative understanding of
judgment endorsed by anti-cognitivists, blindfright is a counterexample to the
thesis that emotions are judgments, because it lacks all marks commonly
associated with judgments. Relative to the liberal understanding of judgment
endorsed by cognitivists, blindfright is an example of how the judgment that

danger is at hand can be instantiated in the absence of awareness of the
eliciting stimulus and without the involvement of the neo-cortex.

The second and more substantive problem is that the Elastic Strategy has
insulated cognitivism from counterexamples at a high price, namely making it
at best trivially true, and at worst unfalsiﬁable.21 Consider ﬁrst what would be
required to falsify the thesis that emotions are judgments of a certain type T.
One would have to either ﬁnd a judgment of type T which is not an emotion,
or an emotion which is not a judgment of type T. To do so, however, one
would need a theory of what it is to be a judgment of type T that is independ-
ent of the cognitivist theory of emotions.

To the best of my knowledge, cognitivists have not offered a substantive
theory of what it is to be a judgment of type T independent of their theory of
emotions. They occasionally endorse a broad understanding of, say, judgment
as the assent to an impression (e.g. Nussbaum [2001]), but they ultimately
explain what counts as assenting to an impression in light of what they take
an emotion to be.

If emotions do not require language, have a distinctive phenomenology,
comprise a motivational dimension, are cognitively impenetrable, and so
forth, the same is true of assents to impressions. What drives the understanding
of judgment are whatever properties emotions are found to have. Notably, the
properties emotion-judgments end up acquiring are not exportable to any
other species of the genus ‘judgment’.

But here is the rub: if the type of judgment T that an emotion is supposed to
be is described in light of a pre-existing theory of emotions and progressively
modiﬁed in response to counterexamples, the thesis that emotions are judg-
ments becomes irrefutable. The historical record of the debate between cogni-
tivists and anti-cognitivists shows that all instances of emotions eventually
manage to ﬁnd room in the unboundedly malleable and arguably unprincipled
notion of judgment presupposed by cognitivists. As Nussbaum ([2001], p. 44)
explicitly puts it, ‘if the emotion is not there, we are entitled to say that the
judgments are not fully or not really there’. Conversely, if the emotion is there,
so is the judgment. How are we going to be able to falsify a theory so conceived?
Cognitivists may retort that the malleability of the notion of judgment is
neither unprincipled nor unbounded, and reject the irrefutability charge. They
may propose that even though animals and infants can formulate judgments
under the liberal understanding of judgment they recommend, trees and rocks
cannot. And they may further add that, even though judgments may be non-
deliberate, unconscious and subcortical, they still require a brain, so unicel-
lular organisms could not possibly issue them. Limitations of this sort may

21 I want to thank an anonymous referee for suggesting that I consider the triviality option along-

side the unfalsiﬁability one.

indicate that cognitivism is not literally an irrefutable thesis. If a tree or a
unicellular organism were shown to have an emotion, the cognitivist theory
would be falsiﬁed even under the liberal notion of judgment cognitivists have
so far proposed.

I am not sure cognitivists would react to the alleged counterexamples by
giving in. They may well suggest that there is a sense in which trees and uni-
cellular organisms also make judgments (e.g., they ‘judge’ that the light comes
from a certain direction). These sorts of modiﬁcations to the notion of judg-
ment do not strike me as signiﬁcantly more radical than those already pro-
posed in response to arguments (1)–(5).

But let us accept for the sake of argument that there can be counterexamples
to the thesis that emotions are judgments, even under the notion of judgment
proposed by cognitivists. If this is the case, cognitivism can be upgraded from
being unfalsiﬁable to being trivially true. If judgments are the sorts of things
that animals and infants (but not trees, rocks and unicellular organisms) can
formulate, then they can be bodily, unconsciously elicited, directly motiv-
ational, cognitively impenetrable, and subcortical,
it is hard to imagine
anyone disagreeing with the thesis that emotions are, in this extremely liberal
sense, judgments.

As I will argue, cognitivism has much more to offer than a trivial truth.
To appreciate its genuine insights, we need to get rid of the Elastic Strategy,
and make a number of distinctions cognitivists have failed to draw.

6 Three Varieties of Cognitivism

My analysis at this point of the article broadens; I want to include in my
discussion not only the version of cognitivism prevalent in philosophy, but
also versions of the cognitivist theory of emotions proposed in the sciences of
mind. Whereas cognitivist philosophers discuss emotions primarily in terms of
‘judgments’, psychologists and neurobiologists discuss them in terms of ‘ap-
praisals’ or ‘cognitions’.

The assimilation of emotions with judgments/appraisals/cognitions has
had three basic functions in the history of cognitivism. Failure to keep them
distinct has led to much confusion. The ﬁrst is to account for the essential
nature of emotions, the second is to account for the cause of emotions, and the
third is to account for the representational content of emotions. My objective is
to sort insights from blindspots of each variety of cognitivism.

6.1 Constitutive Cognitivism

Constitutive Cognitivism is the thesis that emotions are judgments of a par-
ticular sort. It is the variety of philosophical cognitivism I have focused on so

far, and the one the Master Argument Against Cognitivism attempts to falsify.
The basic thesis of Constitutive Cognitivism is the following:

Constitutive Cognitivism: For all emotions E, E is theoretically identiﬁed
with the judgment that the formal object of E is instantiated (by some
material object O)22

For example, according to Constitutive Cognitivism to judge that a bear is
running towards you and that this constitutes danger is to fear the bear, to
judge that your grandmother died and that this constitutes an irrevocable loss
is to be sad about her death, to judge that you have been caught in bed with a
woman other than your wife and that this constitutes a failure to live up to an
ego ideal is to be ashamed about being caught in bed with a woman other than
your wife, and so on.

Constitutive Cognitivism is what philosophical cognitivists generally have
in mind when they assimilate emotions with judgments. After having defended
her liberalized notion of judgment, Nussbaum ([2001], pp. 43–4) writes that
‘we are in a position to conclude not only that judgments of the sort we have
described are necessary constituent elements in the emotion, but also that they
are sufﬁcient’. Solomon ([2003], p. 8) mirrors this position when he writes that
‘[m]y anger-at-John-for-stealing-my-car is inseparable from my judgment that
John in so doing wronged me [ . . .] My anger is my judgment that John has
wronged me’.

Constitutive Cognitivism is afﬂicted by what I call the Problem of Multiple
Components. Consider an episode of intense anger directed by a scholar to-
wards the colleague who informed her that she was denied tenure. At ﬁrst
blush, we can distinguish in the complex phenomenon that is anger several
parts: an evaluative component (e.g., evaluating being denied tenure as a
slight), a physiological component (e.g., increased heart rate and blood pres-
sure), a phenomenological component (e.g., an unpleasant feeling), an expres-
sive component (e.g., ﬁxed stare, loud voice, erected body), a physical action
component (e.g., insulting, storming out of the room), and a mental action
component (e.g., focusing attention, planning an appeal, remembering previ-
ous slights).

In the presence of this multiplicity of heterogeneous parts, the identiﬁcation
of emotions with judgments leads to two equally undesirable alternatives.
If judgments are conservatively understood, as suggested by anti-cognitivists,

22 The parenthetical is due to the fact that, even though emotions generally have material objects,
they do not have them all the time. In objectless anxiety, for instance, the world at large appears
to be threatening, without any object in particular appearing to be threatening. Cases of this sort
can be handled in one of three ways. Objectless emotions can be handed out to a theory of
moods, or they can be considered to be emotions with peculiar material objects (e.g., the world
at large), or they can be considered to be emotions without material objects. The discussion of
which alternative is best lies outside the scope of this article.

Cognitivist Theory of Emotions

749

Constitutive Cognitivism is falsiﬁed on a grand scale, both for its overintel-
lectualization of the evaluative component (think of the evaluative component
of blindfright, which does not even involve awareness), and for its inability to
capture all nonevaluative components of emotions (think of the physiological
discharges of blindfright). If judgments are understood as proposed by cog-
nitivists, on the other hand, evaluative and nonevaluative components are
squeezed by ﬁat into the notion of judgment. As I have argued in the previous
section, the price to pay for judgments to become subcortical, bodily, uncon-
scious, cognitively impenetrable, and so on is that Constitutive Cognitivism
becomes (at best) trivially true.

A cognitivist may ask: why is this so bad? Shouldn’t we gladly accept that in
this limited sense Constitutive Cognitivism is true? The trouble with settling
for the thesis that emotions are judgments very broadly conceived is that we
get little understanding of the emotions out of it. When we search for a the-
oretical identiﬁer for emotion E, we are not looking for a placeholder to des-
ignate the complex condition C whose fulﬁlment makes something an instance
of E. We are looking for that very condition C, in all of its complexity.
Introducing a seemingly unitary construct such as judgment (or appraisal or
cognition for that matter), and turning it into a mongrel of evaluative, physio-
logical, phenomenological, expressive, behavioral and mental components
leads us to lose track of the way in which such components contribute
toward something being an emotion E. It becomes unclear what really is ne-
cessary and sufﬁcient, if anything, for E to be instantiated.23

Cognitivists such as Nussbaum ([2001], p. 196) are fond of saying that
emotions can ‘be deﬁned in terms of judgment alone’. But this qualiﬁes as
false advertisement, because we are not told which complex of evaluative,
physiological, phenomenological, expressive, behavioral, and mental compo-
nents must be fulﬁlled in order to be a judgment of that type. This is the
equivalent of saying that to be water it is necessary and sufﬁcient to be X,
list a number of properties X has (e.g., it is transparent) and a number of
properties X lacks (e.g., it is not combustible), keep silent on what condition
must be fulﬁlled for being X, and conclude that one has deﬁned water ‘in terms
of X alone’.

Constitutive Cognitivism, I conclude, faces a Placeholder Blindspot fatal to
its prospects of success. This is the ﬂaw of wrongly assuming that the identi-
ﬁcation of emotions with judgments—understood as placeholders of unspeci-
ﬁed logical form for a heterogeneous collection of component parts—can

23 There are good Wittgensteinian reasons to be sceptical about the possibility that the logical form
of the condition of membership C for ordinary emotion categories such as fear, shame, guilt, etc.
will take the form of a set of individually necessary and jointly sufﬁcient properties for being E.
For alternative proposals grounded in the prototype theory of concepts, see (Fehr and Russell
[1984]; Ben-Ze’ev [2000]).

really tell us what emotions are. Constitutive Cognitivism does not shed more
light on what emotions are than a mere list of prototypical emotion compo-
nents would do.

The main novelty of my argument against Constitutive Cognitivism is that
it cannot be evaded through the application of the Elastic Strategy. This is
because I have argued that the Elastic Strategy is not the solution to cogni-
tivism’s problems. The Elastic Strategy is the problem.

6.2 Etiological Cognitivism

In the sciences of mind, the notion at the core of cognitivist accounts of the
emotions is that of ‘appraisal’ (or ‘cognitive appraisal’ or ‘cognition’). Broadly
speaking, an appraisal is ‘an evaluation of the personal signiﬁcance of what is
happening in an encounter with the environment’ (Lazarus [2001], p. 40).
Whereas ‘judgment’
is commonly taken by philosophical cognitivists to
refer to the emotion as a whole, ‘appraisal’ designates only its evaluative
component. This leads me to introduce a second variety of cognitivism
whose basic tenet is the following:

Consider fear, sadness and shame once again. According to Etiological
Cognitivism, appraising that danger is instantiated by a bear running towards
you is the cause of fear, appraising that your grandmother’s death instantiates
an irrevocable loss is the cause of sadness, and appraising that your being
caught in bed with another woman by your wife instantiates a failure to live up
to an ego ideal is the cause of shame. For Etiological Cognitivism, appraisals
are causes and possibly component parts of emotions, rather than their es-
sence as proposed by Constitutive Cognitivism.

Whereas Constitutive Cognitivism is the standard bearer of the cognitivist
research program in philosophy, Etiological Cognitivism has been cham-
pioned and developed primarily by psychologists.24 The notion of appraisal,

24 This being said, Etiological Cognitivism is hinted at in the philosophical literature as well,
without being clearly distinguished from Constitutive Cognitivism. For instance, Solomon
writes: ‘All emotions presuppose or have as their preconditions, certain sorts of cognitions—an
awareness of danger in fear, recognition of an offense in anger [. . .] if a person is demonstrably
ignorant of a certain state of affairs or facts, he or she cannot have certain emotions’ (Solomon
[1993], p. 11). Cognitions of danger or offense are in this case conceived as causal preconditions
for emotions, rather than as theoretical identiﬁers of, respectively, fear and anger. Nussbaum
also refers to an interpretation of her theory along the lines of Etiological Cognitivism in this
passage: ‘To call an emotion cognitive [. . .] is just to say that it involves processing of informa-
tion, and in the case of my theory some sort of rudimentary appraisal of the situation relative to
the agent’s goals’ (Nussbaum [2001], p. 115). The rudimentary appraisal of the situation relative
to the agent’s goals is to be understood as the cause of the emotional response, not what is
necessary and sufﬁcient for having the emotion as stated by Constitutive Cognitivism.

Cognitivist Theory of Emotions

implicitly present in the work of a great many emotion theorists since
Aristotle, became the object of scientiﬁc investigation with the work of psych-
[1991]).25
ologists Magda Arnold ([1960]) and Richard Lazarus ([1964],
Arnold ([1960], p. 171) wrote that ‘[t]o arouse an emotion, the object must
be appraised as affecting me in some way, affecting me personally as an indi-
vidual with my particular experience and my particular aims’. She proceeded
to identify the properties of emotional appraisal, describing it as ‘direct, im-
mediate, nonreﬂective, nonintellectual, automatic, “instinctive”, “intuitive” ’
(p. 175).26 Call this form of emotional appraisal primitive.

Lazarus ([1991], [2001]) added to Arnold’s ([1960]) picture the idea that
appraisal is a structured process made of parts.27 Lazarus organized such
parts under two headings: primary appraisal, which aims to determine whether
any of the subject’s goals are at stake, and secondary appraisal, which aims to
determine how to cope with the speciﬁc form taken by the furthering or
thwarting of the subject’s goals.

More speciﬁcally, primary appraisal comprises three components: (i) an
appraisal of goal-relevance, aiming to establish ‘whether an encounter is
viewed by a person as relevant to well-being’ (Lazarus [2001], p. 55), (ii) an
appraisal of goal-congruence and incongruence, aiming to establish ‘whether
the conditions of an encounter facilitate or thwart what the person wants’, and
(iii) an appraisal of type of ego-involvement, aiming to establish what kind of
involvement of the ego is at stake, including ‘self- and social esteem, moral
values, ego-ideals, meanings and ideas, other persons and their well-being, life
goals’ (p. 57).

Secondary appraisal also comprises three components: (iv) an appraisal of
blame or credit, aiming to establish ‘who or what is responsible for a harm,
threat, challenge or beneﬁt’ (p. 56), (v) an appraisal of coping potential, aiming
to establish whether and how the person can ‘ameliorate or eliminate a harm
or threat or bring to fruition a challenge’ (p. 56), and (vi) an appraisal of future

25 All appraisal theories that have appeared in the last forty years are ‘based, at least in part, on the

pioneering efforts of Arnold and Lazarus’ (Scherer et al. [2001], p. 28).

26 Arnold also compared appraisals with ‘sense judgments’, and contrasted them with ‘intellectual
judgments’: ‘When the elephant tests the ground with his foot, he makes a sense judgment. When
the physicist tests a hypothesis by an experiment, he makes intellectual judgments. What we call
appraisal or estimate is close to such a sense judgment’ (Arnold [1960], p. 175).

27 In one of the earliest experiments on the nature of appraisal, Speisman et al. ([1964]) showed that
subjects exposed to a ﬁlm depicting what looked like a painful ritual operation on the genitalia
of the young members of an African tribe found the movie stressful to different degrees depend-
ing on its commentary. A trauma commentary, which emphasized the pain of the subjects
involved, was associated with more stress than a denial commentary, which suggested that no
pain was involved, which in turn was associated with more stress than an intellectualization
commentary, which encouraged subjects to take a detached attitude on the events portrayed.
Lazarus took this experiment to show that between a stressor event and the experience of stress
there must be an intervening process, which in this case was assumed to be that which the
commentary allowed to be manipulated experimentally.

expectancy, aiming to establish whether the ‘troubled person-environment
relationship will change for better or worse’ (p. 57).

Lazarus’ thesis is that each emotion E is caused by a speciﬁc conﬁguration of
the six components of primary and secondary appraisals which combine to
form the appraisal that the formal object of E is instantiated (by some material
object O). Under the interpretation offered by Etiological Cognitivism,
the formal object (or core relational theme) of E is ‘a terse synthesis of the
separate appraisal components into a complex, meaning-centered whole’
(Lazarus [2001], p. 64). Here are some examples of conﬁgurations of appraisal
components corresponding to distinct emotions:

Emotion 

Sadness 

Anger 

Fear 

Guilt 

Shame 

Pride 

Primary and Secondary Appraisal Components 
Goal relevance, goal incongruence, ego involvement of some kind, low 
coping potential, no blame, unfavorable coping potential (open: future 
expectancy) 
Goal relevance, goal incongruence, involvement of self or social esteem, 
blame (open: coping potential and future expectancy) 
Goal relevance, goal incongruence (open: ego involvement, coping 
potential, blame or credit, coping potential, future expectancy) 
Goal relevance, goal incongruence, involvement of moral transgression, 
blame to oneself (open: coping potential and future expectancy) 
Goal relevance, goal incongruence, involvement of ego-ideal, blame to 
oneself (open: coping potential and future expectancy) 
Goal relevance, goal congruence, enhancement of self- or social esteem, 
credit to self (open: coping potential and future expectancy) 

Figure 2. Examples of the conﬁgurations of appraisal components underlying the
causation of some common emotions.

Consider sadness. According to Lazarus’ ([1991], [2001]) theory, my sadness
about my grandmother’s death, due to cancer, is caused by the primary ap-
praisals that her death is relevant to my well being (goal relevance), that it
thwarts what I want (goal incongruence), that it involves the well-being of a
person dear to me (ego involvement), and by the secondary appraisals that
no one is to blame for her death (no blame), and that there is nothing I can do
about it (low coping potential) (with various possible future expectancy
appraisals concerning whether my situation with respect to this event will
change for better or for worse in the future).28 There are several other theories

28 The idea that appraisals are structured into component parts is echoed in the work of philo-
sophical cognitivists. Solomon ([2004], p. 83) argues that an emotion ‘is a complex of judg-
ments’, by which he means judgments roughly along the lines of primary and secondary
appraisals. Nussbaum ([2001], pp. 27–8) points out that ‘[i]n order to have fear—as Aristotle
already saw—I must believe that bad events are impending; that they are not trivially, but
seriously bad; and that I am not entirely in control of warning them off. In order to have
anger, I must have an even more complex set of beliefs: that some damage has occurred to

concerning the structure of appraisal, the discussion of which lies outside the
scope of this paper (see Scherer et al. [2001] for a recent collection of papers on
appraisal).

Now, is Etiological Cognitivism a good theory of emotional causation? This
version of the cognitivist theory of emotions has been harshly criticized for
characterizing appraisals as necessary for emotional causation.29 Zajonc
([1980], [1984]) has inﬂuentially argued there are many instances of emotions
not caused by what he labeled ‘cognitive appraisals’.30 Consider a rabbit con-
fronted by a snake. ‘If the rabbit is to escape’, Zajonc remarked, ‘the action
must be undertaken long before the completion of even a simple cognitive
process—before, in fact, the rabbit has fully established and veriﬁed that a
nearby movement might reveal a snake in all its coiled glory’ ([1980], p. 156,
emphasis added). Zajonc’s critique presupposes that ‘cognitive appraisal’ is a
sophisticated form of information processing involving laborious cognitive
engagement and requiring language possession. We can call this form of
emotional appraisal sophisticated.

Zajonc’s point was that emotions are often caused so quickly that a sophis-
ticated appraisal of the eliciting stimulus simply does not have the time to
occur. Zajonc ([1980]) also pointed out that infants and animals have emo-
tions but lack the resources to engage in sophisticated forms of information
processing. With remarkable prescience, he also suggested that there may be
neural pathways speciﬁcally dedicated to affect, a hypothesis that has received
some degree of conﬁrmation in recent years (see Phan et al. [2002] for a
meta-analysis of the available evidence). For all these reasons, Zajonc con-
cluded that Etiological Cognitivism is a false theory of emotional causation:
appraisals are not needed to cause emotions.

Zajonc’s argument, however, involves a problematic assumption, namely
that appraisals must necessarily be sophisticated. In point of historical fact,
Zajonc’s understanding contrasts with the one proposed by Arnold, who
conceived of appraisals as primitive (i.e., direct, immediate, nonreﬂective,
nonintellectual, automatic, instinctive, intuitive, etc.). What I am suggesting,
however, is not that we should follow Arnold in thinking of appraisals as

me or to something or someone close to me; that the damage is not trivial but signiﬁcant; that is
was done by someone; probably, that is was done willingly’. Notice the resemblance between
these judgments and the species of primary and secondary appraisals proposed by Lazarus
([1991]).

29 The sufﬁciency of appraisal is more commonly accepted. See (Siemer et al. [2007]) for a discus-

sion of the evidence on the necessity and sufﬁciency of appraisal as a cause of emotion.

30 See (Lazarus [1982], [1984]) for a response to Zajonc ([1980], [1984]). Zajonc’s critique, mutatis
mutandis, has been reformulated in recent years by other psychologists (e.g., Frijda and
Zeelenberg [2001]).

primitive. Etiological Cognitivism would be a false theory of emotional caus-
ation whether we think of appraisals as primitive, as suggested by Arnold
([1960]), or as sophisticated, as suggested by Zajonc ([1980]). This is because
it is neither the case that emotion-causing appraisals are always primitive nor
the case that they are always sophisticated. In the case of a rabbit noticing a
snake, the fear-producing appraisal is indeed primitive. In the case of Othello
becoming jealous of Cassio, however, the jealousy-producing appraisal is
sophisticated, and it involves laborious cognitive engagement with the infor-
mation provided by Iago.

A viable Etiological Cognitivism, I suggest, needs to conceive of ‘appraisal’
as lying on a continuum between primitive and sophisticated forms of infor-
mation processing. Understood in these terms, Etiological Cognitivism con-
tains an important insight: stimuli cause emotions not per se, but contingently
upon how they are interpreted. Call this the Perspectival Insight of Etiological
Cognitivism.

Etiological Cognitivism provides the best explanation for three related phe-
nomena: (a) events of the same type can generate an emotion in some indi-
viduals but not in others, (b) events of the same type can generate different
emotions in different individuals, (c) events of the same type can generate
different emotions in the same individual in different circumstances. The ex-
planation for (a)–(c) is that what causes emotions are not events in themselves,
but events under some perspectival interpretation. Flying on airplanes causes
no emotion in some people, elation in others, fear in others, and different
emotions at different times in the same individual (e.g., before and after a
class in panic management). The best explanation for these facts is that the
event of ﬂying on an airplane is appraised in different ways by different people
and by the same person at different times.

I have argued that Etiological Cognitivism can be preserved from falsity if
we think of appraisal as lying on a continuum. A few more wrinkles, however,
have to be considered. Even though emotions are commonly caused by ap-
praisals, there are exceptions. There is some evidence that emotions can be
chemically induced, brought about by brain manipulations, and generated by
simple facial feedback (Izard [1993]). The evidence is not conclusive at present,
but there is no reason for a principled exclusion of forms of emotional caus-
ation other than appraisal.31 This problem can be easily solved. The scope of

31 Emotions fulﬁl their functions when they are elicited in some circumstances rather than in
others. The appraisal process has precisely the job of matching emotions and circumstances
of elicitation. Mechanisms of elicitation such as chemical induction, direct brain stimulation or
facial feedback, on the other hand, do not represent the outcome of an evaluation of circum-
stances, so they are likely to constitute a residual case.

Cognitivist Theory of Emotions

755

Etiological Cognitivism should be restricted. Instead of being a theory about
all instances of emotional causation (‘for all E’), Etiological Cognitivism is
best interpreted as a theory about standard instances of emotion causation
(‘for most E’).

The main problem faced by Etiological Cognitivism in this restricted form is
what I call the Problem of Levels of Appraisal. In order to encompass all
standard cases of emotional causation, appraisal needs to be understood as
occurring at different levels of cognitive complexity. As a result, the class of
appraisals becomes very heterogeneous. Notice that the problem is not simply
that there are important difference between, say, fear appraisal and jealousy
appraisal, but that there are important differences within the classes of fear
appraisals and jealousy appraisals themselves.

Consider for instance the appraisal of danger, identiﬁed by Etiological
Cognitivism as the cause of fear. In the case of blindfright, the appraisal of
danger is extremely quick (it occurs in less than 30 ms), mandatory, uncon-
scious, insulated from higher forms of cognition, mediated by subcortical and
evolutionarily old neural pathways, and most likely homologous to forms of
appraisal of danger available to nonlinguistic and prelinguistic creatures.

Compare blindfright with the kind of fear experienced by a pilot who no-
tices his airplane is becoming lighter, checks on several cockpit instruments,
consults with his co-pilot, calls the control tower, performs some mathemat-
ical calculations, and eventually conﬁrms that the airplane will exhaust its fuel
reservoir within ten minutes while still ﬂying over the ocean. In the case of the
airplane pilot, the appraisal of danger is slower, nonmandatory, fully inte-
grated with higher forms of cognition, verbally reportable, served by
neo-cortical and evolutionarily younger neural pathways, and unavailable
to nonlinguistic and prelinguistic creatures.

Describing the cause of fear in both cases as the appraisal of danger glosses
over the important differences between lower and higher levels of information
processing in terms of speed and automaticity, neural pathways, evolutionary
history, insulation from higher thought processes, and so on.32 Some prelim-
inary work has been done on distinguishing between levels of appraisal (e.g.,
Leventhal and Scherer [1987]; van Reekum and Scherer [1997]; Teasdale
[1999]), but much remains to be understood concerning how many levels of
emotional appraisals there are, what distinguishes them from one another,
and how they interact.

32 This problem would not be solved by knowing the structure of the appraisal process, namely the
components into which it breaks. For instance, knowing that sadness appraisal breaks down
into six kinds of primary and secondary appraisal does not tell us at what distinct levels of
cognitive complexity these six appraisals can be performed, and how appraisals at different
levels interact.

The Problem of Levels of Appraisal is analogous to, but less crippling than,
the Problem of Multiple Components faced by Costitutive Cognitivism. In
Constitutive Cognitivism, the notion of judgment stands for a heterogeneous
variety of component parts that are evaluative, physiological, phenomeno-
logical, expressive, behavioral, and mental. The notion of appraisal, on the
other hand, only stands for a heterogeneous variety of forms of evaluation.
The degree of heterogeneity of ‘judgment’ (as understood by constitutive cog-
nitivists) is several orders of magnitude higher than the degree of heterogeneity
of ‘appraisal’ (as understood by etiological cognitivists). Besides including all
dimensions of heterogeneity affecting the evaluative component of an emo-
tion, it also includes all dimensions of heterogeneity affecting the physiologic-
al, phenomenological, expressive, behavioral and mental components of
emotions.

I

This is why I have recommended the sound rejection of Constitutive
recommend the development of Etiological
Cognitivism, whereas
Cognitivism. What future Etiological Cognitivism needs to achieve is the elim-
ination of its own Placeholder Blindspot, which emerges from wrongly assum-
ing that the identiﬁcation of the cause of emotions with appraisals of formal
objects—understood as placeholders for a variety of levels of information
processing—can truly shed light on how emotions come about. Eliminating
this blindspot demands accounting for what cognitive resources are mobilized
at different levels of appraisal, and for how appraisals performed at different
levels cooperate and compete in adaptive functioning.

6.3 Representational Cognitivism

There is a third important variety of cognitivism often confused with the
previous two. Its basic tenet is the following:

Representational Cognitivism: for all E, emotion E represents the formal
object of E (as instantiated by some material object O)

Representational Cognitivism is the thesis that emotions have representa-
tional content. Consider fear, sadness and shame one more time. According to
Representational Cognitivism, fear represents danger (as instantiated by a
bear running towards you), sadness represents loss (as instantiated by your
grandmother’s death), and shame represents that one has failed to live up to
an ego ideal (as instantiated by being caught by your wife in bed with another
woman). Whereas Constitutive Cognitivism and Etiological Cognitivism iden-
tify the essence of emotions and the cause of emotions with, respectively, the
judgment and the appraisal that the formal object of the emotion is instan-
tiated, Representational Cognitivism states that emotions, whatever they are
and however they are caused, are intentional states of a particular sort.

Cognitivist Theory of Emotions

757

The focus here is neither on the identity nor on the causal history of emo-
tions, but on their intentionality. In this article, I understand intentionality as
follows:

Every intentional state consists of a representative content in a certain
psychological mode [ . . . ] to say that [X] is a representation is simply to
say that it has a propositional content and a psychological mode, that its
propositional content determines a set of conditions of satisfaction under
certain aspects, that its psychological mode determines a direction of ﬁt
of its propositional content. (Searle [1983], p. 11)

These distinctions can be exempliﬁed with respect to propositional atti-
tudes, which are paradigmatic intentional states. For instance, the propos-
itional attitude of believing that p is satisﬁed when p is the case, because its
psychological mode determines a mind-to-world direction of ﬁt for p. This is to
say that the belief is satisﬁed when what the mind believes, namely p, ﬁts the
world. The propositional attitude of desiring that p, on the other hand, is
satisﬁed when p is brought about, because its psychological mode determines
a world-to-mind direction of ﬁt for p. This is to say that the desire is satisﬁed
when the world ﬁts what the mind desires, namely p.

On this view, danger, loss and failure to live up to an ego ideal describe the
conditions of satisfaction of, respectively, fear, sadness and shame in the par-
ticular psychological mode characteristic of each. What Representational
Cognitivism is committed to, on this understanding of intentionality, is that
emotions have conditions of satisfaction under a particular psychological
mode.

Representational Cognitivism originated in philosophy, but it is at this
point a widely shared position in emotion theory (e.g., Damasio [1999]).33
In one of the earliest cognitivist papers in philosophy, Broad ([1954]) made
the connection between cognition and intentionality explicit. He wrote: ‘Every
emotion is an [ . . .] intentional experience, i.e. it is always a cognition, either
veridical or wholly or partly delusive’ (Broad [1954], p. 286). According to
Broad ([1954]), cognitions differ from pure feelings because, whereas the key
question to ask about the former is ‘How does it feel?’, the key question to ask
about the latter is ‘What is it about?’. Nussbaum pointed out that emotions
are ‘not about their objects merely in the sense of being pointed at them and let
go, the way an arrow is released towards its target’, but in the sense that ‘[t]heir
aboutness is more internal, and embodies a way of seeing’ (Nussbaum [2001],
p. 27).

33 Ratcliff ([2005]) has recently argued that, contrary to common belief, even William James con-
sidered the intentionality of emotions essential to understanding them. For two sophisticated
attempts to show that the intentionality of emotions can be reconciled with a feeling-centered
approach, see (Prinz [2004]; Goldie [2000]).

They are internal because the connection between an emotion and its formal
object is a necessary rather than a contingent connection. Emotions are con-
tingently directed towards their targets (or material objects) the way arrows
are, but they necessarily embody a way of seeing because they must represent a
certain formal object in order to be the types of emotion they are (Kenny
[1963]). Solomon makes the conceptual nature of the restriction at hand ex-
plicit in the following passage: ‘What emotions are “about”, as in beliefs, can
be identiﬁed only under certain descriptions, and those descriptions are deter-
mined by the emotion itself [ . . .] the connection between my being angry and
what I am angry about is a conceptual and not causal connection’ (Solomon
[2003], p. 5).

In the same way in which a belief would not be a belief if it did not consti-
tutively aim at truth, and a desire would not be a desire if it did not constitu-
tively aim at being realized, fear would not be fear if it did not constitutively
aim at dangers, sadness would not be sadness if it did not constitutively aim at
losses, shame would not be shame if it did not constitutively aim at failures to
live up to an ego ideal and so on.34 Obviously, episodes of fear can be elicited
in the absence of danger, episodes of sadness in the absence of loss and epi-
sodes of shame in the absence of failure to live up to an ego ideal. The point is
that when they do, they do not fulﬁl their conditions of satisfaction, just like
beliefs do not fulﬁl their conditions of satisfaction when they are false, and
desires do not fulﬁl their conditions of satisfaction when they are unrealized.
Representational Cognitivism contains a fundamental insight. I call it the
Representational Insight: emotions have aboutness or the ability to represent.
This insight has been largely neglected in the history of emotion theory. An
explicit denial of the intentionality of emotions can be found in Hume, the
most inﬂuential feeling theorist of the eighteenth century. Hume ([1739/1992],
p. 415), who referred to the emotions as passions, argued that ‘a passion is an
original existence, or, if you will, modiﬁcation of existence, and contains not
any representative quality, which renders it a copy of any other existence or
modiﬁcation’. Hume was wrong on two accounts. Emotions have representa-
tive qualities with respect to both their material objects and their formal ob-
jects. The anger of the scholar denied tenure represents being denied tenure,
and it represents an offence against me or mine.

In recent writings, Solomon ([2004]) has suggested that the central job
played by the concept of ‘judgment’ in cognitivism is precisely to highlight
the aboutness of emotions: ‘Emotions are about the world. With my concept of
judgment I had tried to make clear that this was not a marginal fact about

34 I will qualify the sense in which emotions constitutively aim at their formal objects shortly.

(some) emotions but the essence of all of them’ (Solomon [2004], p. 77). The
problem with this line of reasoning is that the intentionality of emotions is
assimilated with the intentionality of judgments. If we understand judgments
as
suggested by cognitivists, namely through the Elastic Strategy,
Representational Cognitivism faces its own version of the Placeholder
Blindspot. In other words, if we say that emotions represent the way judg-
ments represent, but then turn the way in which judgments represent into a
placeholder for a heterogeneous variety of ways of representing, we have not
really shed light on the intentionality of emotions.

But if we understand judgments as anti-cognitivists propose, i.e., as pre-
supposing language mastery, conscious assent, the possession of concepts, and
the ability to engage in practical inferences, Representational Cognitivism
collapses into what I call Conceptualist Representational Cognitivism. This
understanding of emotional intentionality is also to be rejected. The ﬁrst
problem with Conceptualist Representational Cognitivism is that it neglects
to account for the fact that the content of (some) emotions is nonconceptual.
For simplicity of reference, let us refer to the nonconceptual content of emo-
tions as affective content.35 The difference in kind between affective content
and the content of judgments can be defended in a variety of ways. I sketch
two reasons to conclude that affective content differs in kind from the content
of judgments: the phenomenological richness of affective content, and its lack
of inferential articulation.36

Consider a phenomenologically salient emotion episode (not all emotion
episodes are), for instance the one I mentioned before of the scholar denied
tenure. Imagine now moving from this complex anger experience to a judg-
ment about what is the case comprising a long conjunction of propositions.
If the anger content were of the same kind as the content of a judgment, the
judgment would be able to capture the content of anger in its entirety, at least
in principle. But the anger content appears to be more ﬁne-grained than the
judgment content in the following sense: it is the sort of content such that there
is always more of it than can be captured by any judgment.

The scholar is engaged in an experience involving many features that con-
cepts can hardly begin to describe. The experience has a multidimensional
richness that includes the expression of embarrassment mixed with pity of
the colleague, the familiar contours of the ofﬁce soon to be abandoned, the

35 I am not committed to the claim that every instance of every emotion has nonconceptual con-
tent. Nor am I committed to the claim that having non-conceptual content precludes having
other types of content. I am committed to the following claim: there are emotions with
non-conceptual content, namely a content differing in kind from judgment content. I add
that most instances of emotion have non-conceptual content, but I will not argue for this
point in this article.

36 These two reasons have often been invoked to explain why perception has nonconceptual con-

tent (see Bermu´ dez [2003] for a map of the nonconceptual content literature).

ﬂeeting image of the department chair saying not to worry about the outcome
of the tenure review, the recent memory of a sleepless night spent dreading the
possibility of being denied tenure, and so on. These elements are all part of the
way the scholar’s anger feels, but they escape capture into a judgment that
something is the case. Too many details appear to go into the experience for it
to be fully judge-able and fully say-able. The scholar may ﬁnd herself at a loss
for concepts suitable to describe the experiential details of what she is going
through.37 More importantly, there does not seem to be any speciﬁc judgment
that corresponds to the experience in full. The transition from what is felt to
what is judged always appears to leave a remainder. This may explain why
emoters often give up on trying to put their emotional experiences into words.
They commonly say: ‘no words can really capture how I feel’.

Besides being phenomenologically richer than judgment contents, affective
contents lack the inferential articulation of judgment contents. Consider a
phobic patient, who represents a snake held in a cage as dangerous by fearing
it. Imagine now moving from fearing the snake to judging that the snake is
dangerous. Judging that the snake is dangerous is inferentially articulated in
the sense that it introduces the judged content into a wide network of infer-
ential relations of incompatibility and logical consequence. For instance, jud-
ging that ‘this snake is dangerous’ is not compatible with judging that ‘this
snake is not dangerous’, it follows from judging that ‘either this snake is
dangerous or this turtle is dangerous, and this turtle is not dangerous’, and
it implies judging that ‘there is at least one dangerous reptile’.

If the fear content were of the same kind as the content of the judgment, the
two contents would have the same inferential articulation. But they do not.
The phobic patient by fearing the snake does not introduce the feared content
into the same wide network of inferential relations of incompatibility and
logical consequence that characterize judged contents. For instance, fearing
the snake is compatible with judging that ‘this snake is not dangerous’,38 it
does not follow from judging that ‘either this snake is dangerous or this turtle
is dangerous, and this turtle is not dangerous’, and it does not imply judging
that ‘there is at least one dangerous reptile’.

The intentionality of emotions does not differ from the intentionality of
judgments merely on account of the nonconceptual nature of affective con-
tent. It also differs from the intentionality of judgments on account of the
speciﬁc psychological mode of emotions. The second problem of Conceptualist

37 See (McDowell [1994]; Brewer [2005]) for a defence of the idea that the problem can solved by
demonstrative concepts, and (Heck [2000]; Kelly [2001]) for some reasons why this solution
should be rejected.

38 The fact that emotions are often in contradiction with judgments has historically been one of the
main grounds of anti-cognitivist dissatisfaction with the cognitivist program, and it is at the
foundation of the dichotomy between reason and passion.

Cognitivist Theory of Emotions

761

Representational Cognitivism is that it neglects to account for the fact that
entertaining emotion content differs from entertaining judgment content in
terms of direction of ﬁt. Consider once again the phobic patient, who repre-
sents a snake held in a cage as dangerous by fearing it. Imagine now moving
from fearing the snake to judging that the snake is dangerous. Judging that the
snake is dangerous has a mind-to-world direction of ﬁt, in the sense that it is
satisﬁed when what the mind judges ﬁts the world, i.e., when the snake is
dangerous.

This judgment will motivate only when joined with a mental state with a
world-to-mind direction of ﬁt, and it will motivate in different ways depending
on the content of the world-to-mind mental state. For instance, the judgment
that the snake is dangerous will motivate to avoid the snake when joined with
the desire to avoid dangerous snakes. On the other hand, the same judgment
will motivate to approach the snake when combined with the desire to ap-
proach dangerous things.

If fearing that the snake is dangerous and judging that the snake is danger-
ous shared their psychological mode, they would determine the same direction
of ﬁt for their contents. But they do not. By fearing the snake the phobic
patient neither engages in a mental state that will motivate only when
joined with a mental state with a world-to-mind direction of ﬁt, nor engages
in a mental state that will motivate in different ways depending on the content
of the world-to-mind mental state with which it is conjoined. On the contrary,
representing the snake as dangerous by fearing it is sufﬁcient for being moti-
vated in a speciﬁc way, namely to avoid it.39

The psychological mode of emotions merges the directions of ﬁt of cognitive
propositional attitudes, which represent contents as obtaining, and conative
propositional attitudes, which represent contents as to be made to obtain.
This Janus-faced psychological mode cannot be captured by a conjunction
of the psychological modes of cognitive attitudes and conative attitudes.40
A conjunction of a cognitive attitude and a conative attitude presupposes
that each conjunct has an existence separate from the other. In contrast, in
emotion the representation of what obtains is inseparable from the represen-
tation of what is to be made to obtain. From fearing a snake it does not even
follow that one judges the snake to be dangerous, a striking example of the
fact that the cognitive component of fear is not freely employable in practical
inferences. Similarly, being motivated to get away from a snake while fearing
it is inseparable from representing it as dangerous and not freely employable
in practical inferences, as the desire to get away from a snake would be.

39 This is not to say that this motivation will be expressed, because fear can be inhibited.
40 As we saw earlier, this is what Solomon ([2003], p. 106) suggested when he wrote that ‘one might
analyze the various emotions as judgmental structures enclosing a core desire which is both their
motivation and their “conatus” ’.

Andrea Scarantino

To capture the psychological mode of emotions, I introduce the notion of
an affective psychological mode, understood as a mode that determines what I
call a mind-to-world-to-mind direction of ﬁt for emotion content.41 A mental
state S has a mind-to-world-to-mind direction of ﬁt when it is satisﬁed just in
case what is made to obtain ﬁts what obtains. This in turn requires that what S
represents as obtaining actually obtains (the mind-to-world part), and that
what S represents as to be made to obtain is actually made to obtain (the
world-to-mind part). The central intuition is that a state S with a mind-to-
world-to-mind direction of ﬁt aims to vary as the world varies so as to direct
behaviors appropriate to the presence of the properties it tracks.

On this view, emotions do not merely represent formal objects as obtaining,
they also represent what is to be made to obtain when formal objects obtain.
This gives us a new understanding of what it is for an emotion to be satisﬁed.
An emotion is satisﬁed when what it successfully represents as to be made to
obtain ﬁts what it successfully represents as obtaining. In such case, the emo-
tion fulﬁlls both it cognitive job (by occurring when the appropriate state of
affairs is instantiated), and its conative job (by guiding behavior appropriately
with respect to the state of affairs represented as being instantiated).

For example, we can think of fear as being satisﬁed when it motivates the
emoter to avoid dangers, of anger as being satisﬁed when it motivates the
emoter to get back at slights, of shame as being satisﬁed when it motivates
the emoter to repair failures to live up to an ego ideal, of disgust as being
satisﬁed when it motivates the emoter to expel noxious substances, and so on.
Conversely, an emotion E can be unsatisﬁed because it fails to occur when the
appropriate state of affairs is instantiated, or because it fails to guide behavior
appropriately with respect to the state of affairs represented as being instan-
tiated. An episode of fear occurring in the absence of danger instantiates a
cognitive failure, whereas an episode of fear not conducive to the avoidance of
danger (for instance because the emoter faints) instantiates a conative failure.
In both case, we can speak of fear as being unsatisﬁed.

Conceptualist Representational Cognitivism, I conclude, is a problematic
theory of the intentionality of emotions. It faces the Affective Content
Blindspot, which consists in the erroneous identiﬁcation of the representation-
al content of emotions with the representational content of judgments (con-
servatively understood), and the Affective Mode Blindspot, which consists in
the erroneous identiﬁcation of the psychological mode of emotions with the
psychological mode of judgments (conservatively understood). The process of
conceptualization of emotions into judgments, I have argued, misrepresents
turns
the intentionality of emotions by transforming it

in kind.

nonconceptual into conceptual content and affective psychological mode into
cognitive psychological mode.

To circumvent the Affective Content and Affective Mode Blindspots and
develop the Representational Insight that emotions have representational
content, Representational Cognitivism will have to develop a positive
theory of affective content and an understanding of the norms governing
states with a mind-to-world-to-mind direction of ﬁt.

7 Conclusion

The three varieties of cognitivism I have distinguished in this article have been
confused with one another ever since cognitivism emerged in the 1970s and
1980s as the dominant force in emotion theory. For instance, Solomon tells us
at the same time that ‘[m]y anger is my judgment that John has wronged me’
(Solomon [2003], p. 8) (Constitutive Cognitivism), that ‘[a]ll emotions presup-
pose or have as their preconditions, certain sorts of cognitions [such as] rec-
ognition of an offense in anger’
(Etiological
Cognitivism) and that ‘the connection between my being angry and what I
am angry about is conceptual’ (Solomon [2003], p. 5) (Representational
Cognitivism). These are three orthogonal theses. Whether or not anger is
the judgment that an offence has been committed is a separate issue from
whether or not anger is caused by the appraisal that an offence has been
committed, which is a separate issue from whether anger is satisﬁed when
an offence against me or mine has been committed.

(Solomon [1993], p. 11)

Constitutive Cognitivism, which aims to tell us what emotions are essen-
tially, is probably the most popular variety of cognitivism. My argument
against this variety of cognitivism, differently from previous arguments,
cannot be evaded through what I called the Elastic Strategy. If ‘judgment’ is
understood conservatively, as anti-cognitivists recommend, Constitutive
Cognitivism is massively falsiﬁed. I have provided a further counterexample
to Constitutive Cognitivism in this article, namely the emotion of blindfright.
If judgments are understood through the lenses of the Elastic Strategy, as the
cognitivists recommend in response to counterexamples such as blindfright,
emotions are assimilated to a mongrel of heterogeneous components, but no
fruitful theory of what emotions are is actually provided.

Etiological Cognitivism, on the other hand, contains the important insight
that stimuli cause emotions depending on how they are appraised. To develop
Etiological Cognitivism, what is needed is an analysis of the different levels of
appraisals, and of their basic causal structures. Representational Cognitivism,
ﬁnally, contains what I consider the most signiﬁcant insight of cognitivism,
which is that emotions have intentionality. A central task for future emotion
theory will be to understand the nature and origin of emotional

representations, which, I have argued, differ in kind from conceptual repre-
sentations on account of both their content and psychological mode.

It is my hope that the long debate between cognitivists and anti-cognitivists,
dogged by absence of clarity on the theses at stake and by terminological
disputes on what judgments are, will be eclipsed in favor of debates between
constitutive cognitivists and anti-cognitivists, etiological cognitivists and
anti-cognitivists, and representational cognitivists and anti-cognitivists. My
guess is that, once the options are clearly on the table, most anti-cognitivists
will
embrace both
Etiological Cognitivism and Representational Cognitivism. At that point,
cognitivism will have exhausted its historical function. The debate between
different theoretical factions will take place within shared cognitivist bound-
aries, and all interesting distinctions will be drawn between varieties of etio-
logical cognitivism and varieties of representational cognitivism.
