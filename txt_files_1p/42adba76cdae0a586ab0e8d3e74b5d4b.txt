Abstract 
 
This  paper  reports  ongoing  EPSRC1-  sponsored  research  to  understand  how  ‘away  from  home’  (public)  toilets 
feature  in  disabled  people’s  participation  in  urban  public  life.  After  tracing  the  origins  of  accessible  toilets,  it  will 
examine the technological responses currently in use in many public toilets and evaluate these designs with respect 
to people with cognitive disabilities. The paper  concludes by pinpointing challenges that need to be resolved by 
designers, before the goal of ‘an inclusive public toilet of the future’ can be realized. 
 
 
1  The Origins of Accessible Toilets 
 
At  present,  many  of  the  UK’s  public  toilets  are  not  accessible  to  people  with  physical,  sensory  or  cognitive 
impairments. Kitchen & Law (2001) have argued that this situation severely limits disabled people’s access to the 
city  and  its  resources.  Since  1979  purpose-designed  unisex  public  toilets  have  been  available  under  the  RADAR2 
scheme, in which specifically adapted toilets for people with disabilities are locked and can only be used by those 
who have access to the appropriate key3. This scheme has been considered controversial from the outset because it 
does  not  guarantee that everyone who needs the accessible facility will also have a key. Meanwhile, providing a 
‘disabled  toilet’4 somewhere in the town centre meant that ordinary public toilet facilities need not be universally 
accessible. The approach epitomised the UK attitude to access and social inclusion that was prevalent at the time, 
which  was  to  assume  that  ‘normal’  provision  for  ‘able  bodied’  members  of  the  general  public  should  be 
supplemented by provision to serve the ‘special needs’ of ‘the disabled’.  
 
1.1  Current Toilet Design 
 
The  design  of  the  RADAR  unisex  public  toilet  was  predominately  determined  by  the  requirements  of  wheelchair 
users. The needs of this specific user group have continued to inform further design standards such as the British 
Standard  BS8300  (Figure  1)  and  Approved  Document  M  (ADM)  of  the  Building  Regulations.  More  recently,  the 
Centre of Accessible Environments has produced ‘The Good Loo Design Guide’ which has included specific toilet 
design solutions for people with visual impairments. However, inclusive design implies a broader consultation with 
people  from  a  wide  scope  of  disability  and  other  user  needs.  The  Inclusive  Design  of  Away  From  Home  (Public) 
Toilets in City Centres research looks beyond the issues of access, to areas of universal needs for safety, privacy, 
cleanliness, comfort and dignity whilst using the public toilet.

3 Members of the public can purchase their own key or are invited to ‘ask for the key’ when needing to use a RADAR locked 
toilet.  
4 Strictly speaking, toilets for disabled people should always be referred to as ‘accessible’ toilets rather then ‘disabled’ toilets, as 
the latter could be deemed offensive and stigmatising. However, in the 1970’s and 1980’s, the term ‘accessible toilet’ was not in 
common  currency.  Pre  2004  legislation  referred  to  ‘toilets  for  disabled  people’  and  many  disabled  people  still  use  the  term 
‘disabled toilet’ today.
