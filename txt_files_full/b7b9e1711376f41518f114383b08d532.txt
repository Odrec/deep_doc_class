ISA-Principles

Topics for Presentations 
Topic

(embedded vs. high performance)

2

Modern Pipelining Principles

(high performance)

3

Sophisticated Cache Principles

(high performance)

Topics of Interest 

emphasis on specific requirements and 
differences of processor classes 
(Desktop/server versus embedded systems), 
reasons for differences (from applicational
point of view)
 design and architectural consequences 
examples (Pentium P4,) IA64 Itanium/core i7 
versus ARM  
implementation at micro-architecture level in 
more detail, examples, e.g. Intel Pentium 5 / 
Itanium/core i7 vs. ARM, may be also MIPS 
R4000 (App. A page 37++),
- performance / problems  limitations of 
ILP, e.g., exception/interrupt-handling, multi-
cycle execution 
In single and multi-processor/core systems 
- advanced cache optimization 
- example(s), e.g. Itanium/core i7/Xeon vs. 
ARM
- may be differences in multi-processors vs. 
multi-core systems

VLIW/EPIC-Architectures

(high performance)

5

Multi-core and Operating System 

(high performance & embedded)

- problems, limitations 
- examples & design considerations 
- especially (global) scheduling for VLIW / 
EPIC (e.g. Itanium/core i7) 
- reasons why not in widespread use 
- comparing efficiency to software-
scheduling  may be by the example of IA-
64 / EPIC 

OS support by ISA and CPU-HW
- boot routine, process management 
- effect of scheduling on pipelining/cache
- virtualization support 
- support/utilization of multiple cores 
- storage handling, shut down process 
? example , e.g. Itanium/core i7/Xeon vs. 
ARM

Program & Compiler Optimization 

(embedded vs. high performance)

7

Embedded Systems-on-Chip 

(high performance embedded systems) 

optimization for fetches, branches, 
vectorization, cache/memory access, 
SIMD instruction usage,  multi core, 
hyper-threading, power
- example, e.g. Itanium/core i7 vs. ARM

ARM-based SoC with on-chip GPUs for  
smart systems like smartphones, 
embedded control systems
- motivation, use cases & design issues
- principles, solutions, e.g. to OS/ISA-
integration and power optimization 
- problems, limitations
- examples
