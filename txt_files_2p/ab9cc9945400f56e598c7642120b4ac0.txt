Abstract
In one of his last publications, Peter Mair documented how party membership had declined substantially in virtually all
European democracies. As his collaborators on this piece, it seems pertinent that we take these findings as a point of
departure and discuss what they mean for our understanding of party democracy. After all, the collapse of membership
figures calls into question one of the central elements of our conceptualization of representative democracy, namely that
it is based on voluntary political participation within political parties. All authoritative typologies of political parties
consider the role of members to be one of their defining elements, although the cartel party most clearly envisages the
marginalization of party members by professional party politicians. The traditional organizational allies of political parties
(e.g. trade unions, organized religion) are subject to similar processes of erosion. In this article, we review the evidence
of the social anchorage of political parties and discuss how political parties and party democracy can survive in an age
where amateur politicians are becoming an increasingly rare species and parties are being transformed into
organizational vehicles for those to whom politics is a profession rather than a vocation.

Introduction

Comparative research has shown that in recent decades
party membership in European democracies has been in
marked decline. The numbers of party members are falling,
both in absolute terms and as a percentage of the electorate.
Parties are struggling to hold on to their membership orga-
nizations and are failing to recruit significant numbers of
new members. While Duverger (1954) expected a ‘conta-
gion from the left’ that would encourage parties across the
political spectrum to adopt a similar organizational struc-
ture to that of the mass party, the emergence of the ‘catch-
all party’ in the late 1950s and early 1960s (Kirchheimer,
1966) not only challenged this conception of the political
party as the representative of pre-defined sectors of soci-
ety, it underlined the temporary nature of the mass party
phenomenon. Katz and Mair’s cartel party thesis drew
attention to the next logical step: party members were
becoming increasingly marginalized within party organi-
zations, and large membership organizations served to
validate the ‘legitimizing myth’ of party democracy rather
than remain true vehicles of linkage between party elites

and society at large (Katz, 1990; Katz and Mair, 1995:
18). Arguably, this could not remain without consequence
for the abilty (and willingness) of parties to recruit mem-
bers let alone to hold on to them.

As parties started to appeal to the electorate at large rather
than aim to represent a specific class or social group, their stra-
tegies became more aggressive as they began to aim at simple
electoral persuasion rather than partisan mobilization. The
focus of party strategy changed from what Parisi and Pasquino
(1979) once defined as ‘the vote of belonging’ to ‘the vote of
opinion’. It was now voters and not committed adherents that
counted, even if these voters were free to turn elsewhere at the
following election. Furthermore, parties shifted from a ‘bot-
tom-up’ to a centralized ‘top-down’ party structure, wherein
