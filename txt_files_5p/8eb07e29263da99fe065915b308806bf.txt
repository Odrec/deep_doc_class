Conflict parties

● Kosovo:

– proclaimed independence from Serbia 2008
– acknowledged by > 100 states (not by Serbia)
– 92% ethnic Albanians, 5,3% Serbs, 2,7% Other

● Serbia:

– Socialist Republic within SFR Yugoslavia
– 2003 „Serbia & Montenegro“, since 2006 „Serbia“
– 82,7% Serbs, 3,9% Hungarian, 13,4% Other 

(without Kosovo)

 

 

Kosovo Conflict: Differences

● different religions (orthodox church, islam)
● different languages (Serbian, Albanian)
● different cultural inheritance
● claim on the same geographical territory

→ problematic coexistence

 

 

Kosovo Conflict: Contradiction

● conflict dates far back (14th century)
● official disputes over the region since 

1912/13

● situation today:

– Albanians are a minority in Serbia (incl. Kosovo)
– Serbs are a minority in an independent Kosovo

 

 

Kosovo Conflict: Polarization

● 1981: Kosovo-Albanians demand a republic
● 1989: Serbia revokes Kosovo's status as 

autonomous province

● 1990-91: Kosovo declares independency from 

Serbia and proclaims an own state

● no international acknowledgement despite 

non-violent secession

● 1995: Bosnian war ends, what about Kosovo?

 

 

Kosovo Conflict: Violence

● 1996: Kosovo Liberation Army (UÇK)

– armed resistance, (bomb) attacks to contend 

Kosovo's independence

● 1998: Serbian police, army, paramilitary groups 

– counter attacks targeting UÇK combatants, 

sympathisers and political opponents

● 1,500 deaths (UÇK combatants and civilians)
● 300,000 displaced Kosovo-Albanians

 

 

Kosovo Conflict: War

● systematic attacks, expulsion, mass murder

→ solidarity among Kosovo-Albanians with  
violent insurgents

● EU sanctions, intervention efforts, peace 

negotiations all fail

● 24/03/1999: NATO air strikes „to prevent a 

humanitarian catastrophe“

→ still: 10,000 dead and 800,000 displaced
● 03/06/1999: Serbia yields to int. pressure

 

 

Kosovo Conflict: Ceasefire

● 10/06/1999: UN Resolution 1244

→ NATO bombing ceases
→ Serbian forces to withdraw from Kosovo, UÇK to stop fighting
→ UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK)
→ NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR) to ensure Security, until today

● 12/06/1999: Milošević accepts conditions
● encouraging autonomy and self-regulation of 

Kosovo                   vs.

● preserving souvereignity and territorial 

integritiy of the FR Yugoslavia

 

 

Kosovo Conflict: Ceasefire

● 2003-08: transport, energy, refugees returns, 
missed persons, state institutions, rule of law

● 2004: riots against non-Albanians
● 2005-07: all negotiation talks fail
● 2007: UN-proposal for a solution fails

→ Albanians want accept it, Serbians refuse it
● 2008: EULEX Kosovo takes over for UNMIK

 

 

Kosovo Conflict: Polarization (again)

● 17/02/2008: onesided declaration of 

independence by Kosovo

● Serbia requests advisory opinion on whether 

or not this breaks international law

● 2010: ICJ ruling: no violation of international 

law or of UN Resolution 1244

 

 

Kosovo Conflict: Agreement

● April 2013: „Brussel's Agreement“ on the 

normalization of the relations

→ dissolution of Serbian parallel structures and 
integration into the Kosovo strucutres
→ Kosovo-Serbian association of local authori-
ties to represent interests on a national level

 

 

Kosovo Conflict: Agreement

Ivica Dačić (Serbia), Catherine Ashton (EU), Hashim Thaci (Kosovo)

 

 

Kosovo Conflict: Normalization

● When? How?

→ Serbia acknowledges the Republic of Kosovo
→ fair administrative treatment of all Kosovars
Kosovo Conflict: Reconciliation

● When? How?

→ understanding for and acceptance of the 
other's religion, culture, lifestyle, (langauge)

 

 

(Why) is this conflict a "New War"?

● state actors (Serbian police, army) and non-state actors 

(UÇK, Serbian paramilitary groups)

● identity politics (ethnic Albanians and Serbs claiming 

power over the same territory)

● non-state financing (UÇK financed through diaspora and 

through criminal activities) 

● violence directed against civilians (13,000 civil victims 

 

vs. 1,500 combatant victims)
 

● diffusion between who is combatant and who is civilian 

(Serbs made no difference between official UÇK 
members and armed civilians)

● diffusion of violence (bomb attacks, ethnic expulsion, 

mass murder)

Current situation & outlook

● constitution, administration, parliament, judiciary
● weak economy, unemployment, poverty, crime
● discrimination and prosecution of minorities
● only 18,000 displaced people have returned
● NATO presence for some years to come
● 2013: violent riots durig local elections
● Kosovo and Serbia on the way to join EU
● stalemate in Kosovo-Serbian talks

 

 

Discussion questions

What do the presented conflicts have in 
common, if they have sth. in common at all?

Is it reasonable to subsume all three conflicts 
under the label of "new wars"?

Is conflict resolution in "new wars" easier or 
harder than in "old" wars? Why?
