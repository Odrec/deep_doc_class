Concerning student presentations:

You can ﬁnd a presentation schedule on Stud.IP (as well as the
corresponding papers).
Presentations are scheduled for 35 minutes (i.e. should
deﬁnitely not be shorter than 30 minutes, and not longer than
40 minutes), and will be followed by 10 minutes of
Q&A/discussion (which are still part of the presentation!).
The Forum summary (Stud.IP) has to be uploaded at
least by Wednesday (or Thursday) morning, 09:00 local
Osnabr¨uck time, before a Friday (or Saturday)
presentation.
If you want me to have a look at your slides before your
presentation, contact me at least one week before the
presentation!

In a perfect world... (1)

...you would be:

...actively participating in the course, e.g. also sharing links to
topic-related material you might encounter elsewhere.

...attending all days (necessary) and sessions (strongly
recommended).

...showing initiative by e.g. contacting me by yourself if you
want me to have a look at your slides before the presentation,
or giving explicit feedback when you do/don’t like parts of the
course.

...uploading the Forum article on time.

...willing to work and contribute in order to make this course a
pleasant and valuable experience for all of us.

In a perfect world... (2)

...I would be:

...answering questions also outsides the classroom and lecture
hours.

...replying to emails within 48 hours (sometimes 72 hours over
weekends).

...trying to make sessions interesting and entertaining as far as
possible.

...capable of sharing with you not only mere factual
knowledge, but some enthusiasm and excitement for the
topics and the ﬁeld.

...seeing all of us as fellow learners on an equal footing.

...creating an environment favorable for collaboration and
joint studying.
