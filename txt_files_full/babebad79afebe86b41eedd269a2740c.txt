Summary  This article demonstrates the potential of the disaggregated expenditure approach in com-
parative welfare state analysis by applying it for comparing patterns of welfare spending across 28 
European countries. An initial factor analysis shows that welfare states differ primarily along their 
emphasis  either  on  cash  transfers  for  the  elderly  or  on  social  services  and  cash  transfers  for  the 
working-age population. European welfare states cluster along these two spending dimensions in a 
way that to a great extent coincides with the well-known delineation of welfare regimes based on 
institutional characteristics. Furthermore, the results attest to the emergence of a variety of welfare 
arrangements in the post-communist region, yet with a general orientation toward a Bismarckian or 
conservative model. The results of this analysis demonstrate that disaggregated welfare expenditure 
measures retain considerable importance in elucidating the realities of contemporary welfare policy. 

Keywords  cluster analysis, disaggregated social expenditure, welfare regimes

Comparing national patterns of welfare policies and 
classifying divergent types of welfare states consti-
tutes  an  important  field  of  comparative  welfare 
state  research  (for  an  overview,  see,  for  example, 
Abrahamson,  2000;  Arts  and  Gelissen,  2002; 
Bambra, 2007; for the genesis of the regime analy-
sis,  see  Castles  and  Obinger,  2008).  Typology-
building is thereby not just an intellectual endeavour 
or  an  end  in  itself,  but  an  important  analytical 
means to an end. Typologies serve as a tool for cog-
nitive  simplification.  In  Richard  Titmuss’  words: 
‘The purpose of model-building is not to admire the 
architecture of the building, but to help us see some 
order  in  all  the  disorder  and  confusion  of  facts, 
systems and choices’ (Titmuss, 1974: 30). Welfare 
state classifications and typologies offer a meaningful 
point of origin for theory-building and causal analysis, 
when  not  only  single  programmes  or  institutions, 

but also the entirety of welfare state arrangements is 
the focus of the research interest. This is often the 
case in macro-quantitative comparisons. 

Classification systems have long been dominated 
by  indicators  of  welfare  institutions  and  social 
rights.  In  contrast  to  simple  measures  of  social 
expenditure,  the  superiority  of  institution  and 
rights-based typologies has been repeatedly stressed 
in the past. Yet the lack of comparable and concep-
tually substantiated time series data on welfare pol-
icies  and  institutions  is  still  an  Achilles’  heel  in 
comparative analysis (Clasen and Siegel, 2007).1 As 
a consequence, cross-country comparisons of welfare 
policy  patterns  and  their  causes  and  effects  have 
either  been  limited  to  countries  for  which  more 
sophisticated  data  like  welfare  state  generosity  is 
available,  (that  is,  the  Organisation  of  Economic 
Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries)

or  aggregate  social  expenditure  is  still  taken  as  a 
proxy  measure  for  welfare  stateness  especially  in 
analyses with pooled designs. The latter is especially 
unsatisfying,  since  total  social  expenditure  reveals 
barely anything of the contents of welfare policies 
and is often misleadingly interpreted as a measure of 
welfare generosity. 

As  increasingly  more  attention  is  paid  to  the 
dynamics  of  welfare  arrangements  on  the  one 
hand,  and  to  the  configuration  of  welfare  state 
arrangements  in  developing  and  middle-income 
countries  on  the  other,  the  question  of  feasible 
measures for welfare policies and the demand for 
appropriate  and  comparable  data  gains  added 
importance. One way of addressing this problem 
consists of refining the conception and utility of 
expenditure measures by relying on disaggregated 
social expenditure data and thus on the functional 
differentiation  of  welfare  spending.  These  kinds 
of data illuminate the contents of welfare policy 
effort,  namely,  which  programmes  and  purposes 
governments  emphasize  in  the  realm  of  welfare. 
Two  sources,  the  Social  Expenditure  Database 
(SOCX) by the OECD and the European System 
of 
Statistics 
(ESSPROS) by the Eurostat, now provide scholars 
with annual, time series data for a large number 
of countries. 

Social  Protection 

Integrated 

This article argues that the potential of disaggre-
gated  expenditure  data  is  far  from  being  fully 
exhausted  in  comparative  welfare  policy  analysis. 
Building upon earlier approaches (see for example 
Castles,  2004,  2008;  Flora,  1986;  Kautto,  2002; 
Klau, 1985; Saunders and Jensen, 2008; Tepe and 
Vanhuysse, 2010), I demonstrate that disaggregated 
expenditure  data  is  well  suited  for  comparative 
endeavours and, even though telling less about the 
quality  or  effectiveness  of  welfare  policies  for  the 
recipients, it reveals important parameters of welfare 
policy  arrangements  especially  from  the  public 
policy perspective. This article seeks to extend the 
disaggregated  expenditure  approach  for  compara-
tive analysis of welfare policy patterns by addressing 
the  following  question:  Do  disaggregated  welfare 
spending  patterns  reveal  significant  cross-country 
variation  among  European  welfare  states  in  line 
with a theoretically meaningful distinction between 
welfare regimes? In order to test this empirically, I 
take on Castles’ (2008) framework of four distinct 
spending  categories.  While  Castles’  approach  was 

primarily  descriptive,  derived  from  observing  the 
distinct  spending  patterns  among  Western  OECD 
countries, I apply a more robust method by utilizing 
factor  and  cluster  analysis  for  28  European  coun-
tries and use the ESSPROS data. This approach inte-
grates the Central and Eastern European (CEE) new 
member states of the European Union (EU) in the 
quantitative comparative analysis of welfare policy 
patterns – an attempt that has gained little methodo-
logically substantiated attention thus far. Applying 
the newly available disaggregated data will facilitate 
exploring  which  ways  the  emerging  patterns  of 
welfare policy arrangements in these countries cor-
respond  to  those  prevalent  in  Western  Europe.  In 
contrast to most previous analyses, I also account 
for social needs pressure factors potentially affecting 
welfare spending levels by adjusting the data with 
adequate weights. The results show that European 
countries cluster in a theoretically meaningful way 
along their functional welfare spending. These clus-
ters coincide to a high extent with different regimes 
or worlds of welfare.

The study is structured as follows: the next section 
discusses advantages, possibilities and limits of dis-
aggregated expenditure approaches and introduces 
three contemporary classifications of welfare states 
based  on  their  functional  spending  structure.  The 
third section outlines the data and method used in 
this  study  and  discusses  the  data  treatment  for 
adjusting  welfare  expenditure  for  needs  pressures. 
In the fourth section, the dimensionality of welfare 
spending is first depicted through a factor analysis 
before  testing  how  28  European  welfare  states 
cluster with respect to distinct categories of welfare 
policy expenditure. The characteristics of the clus-
ters  revealed  by  the  analysis  are  subsequently  dis-
cussed. The final section concludes by discussing the 
advantages and caveats of this approach for future 
research. 

Disaggregated social expenditure as a 
measure for welfare policy patterns
Advantages and limits of expenditure 
approaches in welfare state comparisons

As has been noted repeatedly by scholars of compar-
ative welfare state research, total social expenditure 
gives little information about the substantive content 
or  generosity  of  welfare  policies.  Esping-Andersen

correctly  argues  that  ‘by  scoring  welfare  states  on 
spending,  we  assume  that  all  spending  counts 
equally’ and that ‘expenditures are epiphenomenal 
to  the  theoretical  substance  of  welfare  states’ 
(Esping-Andersen,  1990:  19).  With  this  critique, 
expenditure  measures  faded  from  the  research 
agenda,  although  total  social  expenditure  is  still 
often – and frequently rather blindly – used as an 
indicator for the extent of welfare stateness in many 
comparative macroquantitative studies, simply due 
to  the  availability  of  data.2  For  comparative  pur-
poses, the validity of the indicators at hand inevita-
bly depends on the question one aims to answer and 
the assumptions one makes a priori. Therefore, how 
expenditure  measures  are  operationalized  for  ana-
lytical purposes is of key importance (Castles, 2004; 
Siegel, 2007). In general, total social expenditure is 
considered  a  valid  measure  of  the  overall  welfare 
effort  (De  Deken  and  Kittel,  2007;  Siegel,  2007). 
Especially in times of economic hardship, allocation 
of governmental budgets and the costs of social pro-
vision  become  particularly  contentious  in  political 
debates.  Consequently,  the  actual  emphasis  on 
social  matters  as  measured  by  social  expenditure 
illuminates  many  politically  relevant  aspects  of 
welfare policy (Siegel, 2007). 

Examining  the  structure  of  social  expenditure, 
particularly through a more sensitive disaggregated 
analysis,  sheds  more  light  on  the  contents  of  the 
welfare effort and thus the political salience of dif-
ferent welfare policy programmes. Using disaggre-
gated data offers several advantages (Castles, 2004; 
Siegel, 2007). First, it improves aggregate measures 
and  makes  them  more  theoretically  informed  and 
comparable over time and across countries. Second, 
using  disaggregated  data  offers  insights  into  the 
asymmetries between different domains of welfare 
policy and makes it possible to account for volatility 
in  the  structure  of  welfare  policies  over  time. 
Moreover, looking at disaggregated data allows for 
distinguishing  ‘welfare  state  structures  in  terms  of 
the  kinds  of  social  provision  they  offer’  (Castles, 
2004: 48). This way, it is possible to develop empir-
ically based typologies. Finally, the data availability 
for a great number of countries on an annual basis 
is an indisputable advantage that enables more sys-
tematic  research  designs  and  time  series  analyses 
and thus contributes better to the needs of scholarly 
work in comparative welfare state research.

Looking  at  disaggregated  and  functionally  dis-
tinct spending data does of course not alter the fact 
that expenditure figures do not reveal much about 
the  distributional  logic  of  welfare  policies  or  the 
social rights in a given welfare state (Siegel, 2007). 
Institutional  measures  remain  the  only  alternative 
when such dimensions of welfare policy settings are 
the focus of research. Furthermore, gross expendi-
ture levels do not consider possible tax effects that 
may  lead  to  considerable  variance  in  net  expendi-
ture depending on the taxation or non-taxation of 
cash benefits (cf. Adema and Ladaique, 2005).

Worlds of welfare spending?

While  several  studies  draw  on  disaggregated  or 
decomposite  spending  data  in  analysing  welfare 
policies (for example Alestalo and Uusitalo, 1992; 
Flora, 1986; Saunders and Klau, 1985), classifica-
tion  attempts  on  the  basis  of  spending  figures  are 
less  widespread.  At  the  most  general  level,  public 
expenditure on social purposes can be distinguished 
by  spending  on  cash  benefits  or  transfers  (for 
example, pensions or unemployment benefits) and 
on benefits in kind or services (for example, child-
care facilities or services for disabled). Starke et al. 
argue  that  this  division  is  not  a  trivial  one,  but 
instead that the role of transfers and services in the 
national ‘welfare mix’ is one of the defining charac-
teristics of welfare state regimes (Starke et al., 2008: 
984). Spending on transfers corresponds roughly to 
the  decommodification  dimension 
in  Esping-
Andersen’s  terms  and  spending  on  services  to  the 
defamilization  dimension.  Accordingly,  welfare 
states  differ  based  on  the  degree  to  which  they 
emphasize  one  of  these  dimensions  (for  example, 
Jensen,  2008;  Kautto,  2002;  Korpi  and  Palme, 
1998).  In  corporatist–conservative  welfare  states, 
spending on transfers outbalance spending on serv-
ices, often because caring for the elderly or children 
is primarily seen as the responsibility of the family. 
In Scandinavian welfare states, the share of service 
spending is high since care functions are taken over 
by the state, but generous benefit levels and univer-
sal  eligibility  criteria  also  lead  to  high  levels  of 
spending on cash transfers (Esping-Andersen, 1999; 
Kautto,  2002).  Within  the  liberal  welfare  cluster, 
only  modest  levels  of  cash  benefits  compliment  a 
rather important service provision (Castles, 1993).

In  a  cluster  analysis  including  15  EU  member 
states in 1990 and 1997, Kautto finds support for 
the existence of three distinct country clusters when 
clustering these countries according to the relative 
weight of their service effort. A first ‘service effort 
group’  consists  of  primarily  the  Nordic  countries, 
while a second ‘transfer approach group’ consists of 
Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria and Italy. A third 
group is characterized by both low service and low 
transfer  effort  and 
includes  Ireland  and  the 
Mediterranean countries (Kautto, 2002: 62). 

The distinctiveness of transfer and service spending 
is  also  supported  by  a  clustering  approach  for  18 
OECD countries in 2001 by Jensen (2008). Four clus-
ters,  which  to  a  large  part  coincide  with  the  three 
welfare  regimes 
identified  by  Esping-Andersen, 
emerge when distinguishing between expenditure on 
transfers  and  social  services.  Jensen  further  argues 
that an emphasis on healthcare services follows a dis-
tinct logic compared with other social service expend-
iture because social services reflect differing degrees 
of  ideological  saliency  in  different  regimes,  while 
healthcare  is  a  more  ideologically  non-salient  issue 
(Jensen, 2008: 159; see also Anttonen et al., 2003). 

Francis G. Castles further differentiates between 
four 
functionally  specific  spending  categories 
(2008).3  The  following  four  categories,  which  are 
based  on  the  present  classification  system  of  the 
OECD SOCX data, build the basis for Castles’ anal-
ysis (Castles, 2008: 48):

•  Age-related cash benefits (old-age and survivors’ 

cash benefits)

•  Working-age benefits (income support payments 
in respect of incapacity, unemployment, families 
and  social  assistance  plus  spending  on  active 
labour market policies)

•  Healthcare services (benefits in kind)
•  Other  service  expenditure  (all  social  services 

other than health)

These  four  categories  illuminate  the  intentions  of 
welfare spending better than the simple division in 
transfers and services. They likewise provide more 
possibilities  for  linking  the  data  with  conceptual 
contents. For example, the category of working-age 
cash benefits accounts for all kinds of risks (old and 
new) that citizens face in the course of their working 
lives and thus corresponds more specifically to the 
idea  of  decommodification  than  cash  transfers  in 

general. Pensions and survivors’ benefits to a certain 
extent follow a different logic and are based on pre-
vious savings and contributions – especially in the 
corporatist-oriented countries. 

Through examining levels of spending as a percent-
age of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2003, Castles 
not only shows that considerable cross-national vari-
ation  between  the  four  categories  occurs,  but  also 
that the 23 Western OECD countries included in the 
analysis  differ  in  their  spending  profiles  and  form 
clusters  or,  in  his  own  earlier  terms,  ‘families  of 
nations’. Like the clusters detected in Jensen’s analy-
sis,  these  families  correspond  to  Esping-Andersen’s 
welfare regimes. According to Castles, different areas 
of  expenditure  are  not  significantly  correlated. 
Together with the descriptive analysis of the spending 
figures, this underlines the argument that not only do 
some countries spend more than others, but also that 
countries differ considerably in their spending priori-
ties and that these priorities seem independent from 
levels  of  social  spending.  Therefore,  the  disaggre-
gated social expenditure approach ‘has the potential 
to provide us with new information about the nature, 
the causes and the consequences of welfare state var-
iation’ (Castles, 2008: 51–2). 

Despite the strikingly lucid argumentation about 
the grouping of countries, the analysis performed by 
Castles (2008) is less substantiated in methodologi-
cal terms since it leans purely on a description of the 
spending patterns. This study ties in with the disag-
gregated expenditure approach proposed by Castles 
but employs a more sophisticated statistical method 
based on factor and cluster analysis. The approach 
is  applied  for  28  European  countries  in  order  to 
reassess  whether  disaggregated  spending  profiles 
coincide  with  different  established  and  emerging 
welfare regimes. Besides the Western European EU 
member states, the post-socialist CEE countries are 
included in the analysis as well. 

In  line  with  the  results  of  Castles’  study,  the 
Western  European  welfare  states  should  cluster 
along their spending patterns in a way that has been 
postulated  by 
the  studies  mentioned  above. 
However,  the  spending  patterns  in  the  CEE  coun-
tries are hypothetically more open. Although some 
comparative work has already been done, identify-
ing emerging patterns of CEE welfare regimes is still 
tentative, largely resulting from the lack of quantita-
tive  data  on  welfare  institutions  and  other  policy 
measures  for  these  countries  (see,  among  others,

Cerami  and  Vanhuysse  (2009),  Inglot  (2008)  and 
Szikra  and  Tomka  (2009);  for  patterns  of  public 
policy  in  more  general,  see  Castles  and  Obinger, 
2008).  In  general,  social  expenditure  in  the  CEE 
countries  is  on  average  lower  than  in  the  Western 
European countries, yet considerable cross-country 
variation occurs (Jahn and Kuitto, 2010). Previous 
studies  have  revealed  that  the  mostly  Bismarckian 
pre-socialist institutional setting of the CEE welfare 
states  influenced  the  configuration  of  the  post-
socialist  welfare  policies  (Cerami  and  Vanhuysse, 
2009;  Inglot,  2008;  Szikra  and  Tomka,  2009). 
Accordingly, the CEE countries should exhibit simi-
larities with corporatist Western European counter-
parts. Another hypothetical direction of the welfare 
arrangements  in  the  CEE  countries  would  be  a 
liberal model, providing only basic social security in 
case of loss of income due to neoliberal influences 
and financial emergencies in the course of the transi-
tion period. For reasons of austerity, it is less likely 
that  the  universalistic  features  and  extensive  state 
services  provided  by  socialist  governments  would 
have persisted in the post-socialist period. 

Variables, data and method
Variables and data

The following empirical analysis applies a modifica-
tion of Castles’ approach for 28 European countries 

in 2005–7.4 The ESSPROS data allows including the 
non-OECD  countries  of  the  EU  in  the  analysis. 
Castles’ concept, which was based on SOCX data, is 
therefore modified to conform to the spending cat-
egories offered by the ESSPROS data. In contrast to 
Castles,  who  includes  spending  on  active  labour 
market  policies  (ALMP)  into  the  dimension  of 
working-age benefits, this study focuses on welfare 
policies in a narrower sense and therefore excludes 
ALMP spending. Activation policies in general are 
certainly  gaining  more  and  more  importance  in 
many countries and their impact on the living condi-
tions  of  the  working-age  population  has  been 
pointed  out  by  Powell  and  Barrientos  (2004), 
Serrano Pascual and Magnusson (2007), and Castles 
(2008)  among  others.  Yet,  if  one  would  like  to 
analyse  patterns  of  governmental  effort  for  social 
policies in a broader sense, one should consider not 
only ALMP, but also other policy fields such as edu-
cation (Jensen, 2008; Hudson and Kühner, 2010). In 
the  narrower  sense  applied  in  this  study,  welfare 
policies  include  basic  social  security  programmes 
and social services, which are essential for cushion-
ing diverse social risks in individuals’ lives.

Given these adjustments, the following variables 
in the four functional spending categories reported 
in Table 1 were included in this analysis, measured 
as percentage of GDP.

Utilizing the ESSPROS data affects the compara-
bility of the data and results of this study with the

previous  studies  discussed  above,  since  they  are 
based on the SOCX data. As has been shown by De 
Deken and Kittel (2007), the ESSPROS and SOCX 
data  differ  considerably  in  some  regards.  For 
example, the OECD has taken a different approach 
to that of Eurostat in defining what actually counts 
as  public  spending.  While  in  the  ESSPROS  data, 
spending is defined as ‘public’ if the decision power 
lies with the government, in the SOCX data spend-
ing is only considered to be ‘public’ when it is carried 
into  execution  by  governmental  sector  agents.  In 
other words, the ESSPROS data also includes man-
datory  schemes  in  public  expenditure.  Therefore, 
spending  figures  are  in  most  cases  systematically 
higher than the respective figures by the SOCX data 
(De Deken and Kittel, 2007: 74). In addition, spend-
ing in some categories counts differently. Although 
the functional categories accounted for in this study 
and in Castles’ analysis are nearly identical in both 
data  sources,  the  correlations  are  far  from  being 
perfect when accounting for all commonly available 
years  and  countries  for  which  both  SOCX  and 
ESSPROS data are available.5

Adjusting the data for demographic and needs 
pressures

Given that expenditure on social benefits is highly 
dependent on the population in need, this needs to 
be accounted for when analysing expenditure data 
(Clayton and Pontusson, 1998; Huber and Stephens, 
2001; Kangas and Palme, 2007; Saunders and Klau, 
1985; Siegel, 2007). If aiming to identify patterns of 
welfare spending in a cross-country setting, with the 
underlying assumption that these patterns indicate 
the  welfare  policy  priorities  of  governments,  then 
variation caused by factors automatically affecting 
the levels of social expenditure should be eliminated. 
For  example,  the  number  of  unemployed  persons 
leads to a higher ratio of unemployment cash bene-
fits in proportion to GDP independent of political 
decisions or any changes in the legislation concern-
ing  unemployment  benefits.  As  great  cross-county 
variation  exists  with  regard  to  the  population  in 
need,  leaving  this  unconsidered  would  distort  the 
comparison.6 In this analysis, I account for cyclical 
and structural needs resulting from the size of popu-
lation entitled to different benefits through weight-
ing  the  disaggregated  expenditure  categories  by 
respective  structural  and  demographic  variables. 

Although  it  is  not  possible  to  determine  the  exact 
numbers of (potential) recipients, I use proxy vari-
ables that come closest to the needs pressures. The 
two  most  common  needs  pressure  factors  are  the 
unemployment  rate  and  the  proportion  of  elderly 
population  (the  percentage  of  population  over  65 
years old of the total population). Consequently, the 
unemployment cash benefits and benefits in kind are 
weighted  by  the  unemployment  rate.  The  old-age 
cash benefits and benefits in kind are weighted by 
the ratio of population aged over 65 years old.7 

In case of family and sickness benefits, it is more 
difficult  to  measure  the  needs  pressure  in  a  proper 
way.  Family  or  childcare  allowances  make  up  the 
greatest part of family cash benefits and so I follow 
the suggestion by Kangas and Palme and weight the 
expenditure  on  family  cash  benefits  by  the  propor-
tion of persons aged 16 years or younger (Kangas and 
Palme, 2007: 110).8 Family benefits in kind consist 
mainly of child daycare costs and therefore expendi-
ture on family benefits in kind is weighted by the pro-
portion of children under school age (below 7 years 
of age).9 In case of sickness benefits, again in line with 
the suggestion by Kangas and Palme, life expectancy 
is taken as a proxy for the overall health status of the 
population.  The  basic  assumption  is  that  the  adult 
population is healthier in countries where life expect-
ancy is higher. Therefore, there should be less sick-
leave  days  among  the  working-age  population. 
Although this measure is only a very rough approxi-
mation and also prone to counterfactual argumenta-
tion, I weight sickness cash benefits by the reversed 
life expectancy in absence of more suitable alternative 
data.10  For  healthcare  benefits  in  kind,  I  perform 
inverse  weighting:  when  life  expectancy  is  high, 
higher  expenses  for  the  healthcare  systems  occur 
simply due to the fact that a greater proportion of 
elderly  persons  in  the  total  population  is  likely  to 
raise the need for medical care. Therefore, sickness 
benefits in kind are weighted by life expectancy. 

For all other fields of benefits, no weighting was 
made due to a lack of adequate data on persons in 
need  for  time  series  and  across  the  countries. 
Weighting some of the benefit dimensions by pres-
sure factors and leaving others unweighted certainly 
leads  to  somewhat  biased  data,  but  since  these 
unweighted categories sum up only to 4.5 percent of 
GDP  on  average  (or  17.6  percent  of  total  social 
spending), the bias should be less serious than when 
leaving the major benefit categories unweighted.

The adjustment procedure results in values which 
are  on  average  14.3  percent  lower  than  the 
unweighted  values  in  the  case  of  age-related  cash 
benefits, 5.8 percent in the case of working-age cash 
benefits, 22.2 percent in the case of healthcare serv-
ices,  9.1  percent  in  the  case  of  social  services  and 
finally 13.3 percent of total social spending.

Method

In a first step, the dimensionality of welfare spend-
ing is depicted through an explorative factor analy-
sis  allowing  for  interdependence  of  the  factors 
(principal  component  analysis  with  Oblimin  rota-
tion) and n components using the means for 2005–7 
of the four spending categories. The factor analysis 
facilitates  discovering  potential  latent  dimensions 
behind the observed data but at the same time is also 
a necessary step for dealing with problems of multi-
collinearity in the subsequent cluster analysis. The 
four spending categories are correlated partly to a 
substantially high degree in the sample of countries 
in this study. In particular, age-related cash expendi-
ture correlates with healthcare services (r = 0.579**) 
and  working-age  cash  expenditure  correlates  with 
both  healthcare  expenditure  (0.517**)  and  social 
service expenditure (0.682**). Due to these correla-
tion patterns, the spending categories should not be 
included  in  the  cluster  analysis  simultaneously 
because  highly  correlated  variables  can  implicitly 
overweight  some  of  the  variables  in  the  clustering 
procedure, thus distorting the results. Using factor 
scores in the clustering procedure is one established 
way to deal with this problem (Everitt et al., 2001). 
In  the  second  step,  in  order  to  explore  whether 
and  how  European  countries  group  along  their 
spending profiles, I apply an agglomerative hierar-
chical  clustering  procedure  (hierarchical  cluster 
analysis, HCA) using the squared Euclidian distance 
as a distance measure and the Ward method as clus-
tering  algorithm.  For  classifying  countries  along 
theoretically  and  empirically  distinctive  features, 
cluster analysis is the method of first choice (Bambra, 
2007; Gough, 2001; Kangas, 1994). After an exten-
sive period of under-representation in comparative 
welfare  state  research,  cluster  analysis  has  gained 
momentum in attempts to classify welfare states or 
to identify welfare regimes (Bambra, 2007; Gough, 
2001;  Jensen,  2008;  Kautto,  2002;  Powell  and 
Barrientos,  2004;  Obinger  and  Wagschal,  2001; 

Saint-Arnaud  and  Bernard,  2003).  The  goal  of 
cluster  analysis  is  to  determine  clusters  of  objects 
that display small within-cluster variation relative to 
between-cluster  variation.  The  specific  clustering 
method  utilized  in  this  analysis  determines  cluster 
membership on the basis of the total sum of squared 
deviations from the mean of cluster and has proven 
to  perform  well  in  allocating  cases  ‘correctly’  to 
clusters (Bergs, 1981; Everitt et al., 2001). Therefore, 
it has become a standard for many social scientific 
clustering  approaches  to  solve  classification  prob-
lems  (for  example,  Castles  and  Obinger,  2008; 
Jensen,  2008).  The  robustness  of  the  clusters  is 
further tested by the means of alternative clustering 
methods.

Findings
Dimensionality of welfare spending 

As described earlier, the spending categories corre-
late to some degree. An explorative factor analysis 
allows for further inspection of underlying patterns 
of  welfare  policy  spending  behind  the  spending 
figures. If the assumption that welfare policy spend-
ing in cash benefits is distinct from spending on ben-
efits in kind is to hold true, as has been suggested, 
among  others,  by  Kautto  (2002),  then  the  age-
related cash spending and working-age cash spend-
ing should load on one dimension and the spending 
on healthcare services and other social services on 
another  dimension.  Yet  this  is  not  the  case.  The 
analysis resulted in two distinct dimensions account-
ing for 85.3 percent of the total variation: the first 
consisting of working-age cash spending and social 
services spending; the second consisting of old-age 
cash  and  healthcare  in  kind  spending  (Table  2). 
Healthcare service spending loads on the first factor 
as well, but the factor loading is much higher on the 
second  factor.  The  first  factor  is  characterized  by 
the highest loading for social service spending and 
the second by age-related spending.

The factor analysis was also run with pooled data 
from  1995–7  and  only  for  the  Western  European 
countries  in  order  to  see  whether  the  two  dimen-
sions also hold true when including time series or 
only the mature welfare states. Given the relatively 
small number of cases, jack-knifing, that is, excluding 
each  case  at  a  time,  was  additionally  applied  in 
order to control for possible effects of single cases

on the results. In all cases, very similar results occur. 
I  also  conducted  a  factor  analysis  with  the  single 
components of the different spending categories in 
order to see whether the a priori grouping of welfare 
spending  into  theoretically  based  categories  domi-
nates  the  results.  The  results  indicate  that  old-age 
cash spending, survivor’s cash spending and sickness 
benefits in kind make up the three strongest load-
ings for the first component. Family benefits in kind, 
old-age benefits in kind and sickness cash benefits 
are  the  dominant  three  variables  in  the  second 
component.  Unemployment  cash  benefit  spending 
is  more  ambiguous,  loading  moderately  in  both 
dimensions.11 

Altogether, the results give little support for the 
distinctiveness of welfare policy spending simply in 
cash  and  services  spending  as  the  two  dominant 
dimensions of welfare spending choices. Instead, the 
spending priorities in these European countries seem 
to  be  distinguished  by  income  replacement  after 
working-life on the one hand, and in investment in 
social  services  and  working-age  income  mainte-
nance  on  the  other.  In  other  words,  some  welfare 
states emphasize old-age benefits over other fields of 
welfare provision – a type of benefit which is often 
based  on  contributions  during  working  life  and 
typical  for  conservative-corporatist  welfare  states. 
Other  welfare  states,  where  the  second  spending 
dimension  dominates,  feature  a  social  investment 
strategy  in  services  and  working-age  benefits.  The 
addressees represent broader layers of the society in 
terms of age, gender and employment status and this 
kind of welfare spending is particularly conducive to 
decommodification and defamilization. Healthcare 
service spending seems to be distinct from the other 

spending categories to a certain extent although it is 
more pronounced in countries scoring high on the 
first  dimension.  This  supports  the  non-salience  of 
the healthcare viewpoint in welfare policy priority 
setting (Jensen, 2008). 

Clusters of welfare spending patterns

Given the dimensionality of welfare spending, how 
do the European welfare states cluster along the two 
spending  dimensions?  In  a  first  step  of  the  cluster 
analysis, only the Western European countries were 
included in the hierarchical cluster analysis in order 
to examine how the spending patterns of the mature 
welfare states fit into the established regime catego-
ries. The factor scores resulting from the factor anal-
ysis  above  are  entered  in  the  cluster  analysis  as 
clustering  variables  as  previously  mentioned.  The 
results  presented  in  Figure  1  strongly  support  the 
idea of distinct worlds of welfare spending, showing 
that four clusters emerge that largely correspond to 
the  established  regimes.  Yet  some  deviations  also 
occur. First, Austria, Belgium, Germany, France and 
the  Netherlands  form  one  cluster,  but  contrary  to 
many  other  categorization  attempts,  the  UK  and 
Switzerland  also  join  this  cluster,  which  could  be 
characterized  as 
the  conservative  Continental 
European cluster.12 Second, the Scandinavian coun-
tries  form  a  distinct  Nordic  cluster  which  is  first 
formed by Denmark and Sweden and then joined by 
Iceland,  Norway  and  Finland.  Third,  Greece, 
Portugal  and  Italy  group  together,  thus  forming  a 
Southern European cluster. A fourth cluster, which 
seems  less  coherent  in  theoretical  terms,  which  I 
therefore  call  a  Mixed  cluster,  consists  of  Ireland,

Luxembourg and Spain. Contrary to most of the pre-
vious  categorization  attempts,  clustering  along 
welfare  spending  patterns  neither  disposes  the  UK 
and  Ireland  to  building  a  distinctive  liberal  or 
English-speaking family, nor groups them in one and 
the  same  cluster.13  The  main  dividing  line  runs 
between  the  Continental  and  Southern  European 
clusters  on  the  one  hand  and  the  Nordic  and  the 
Mixed  clusters  on  the  other.  As  previously  stated 
among others by Ferrera (1996), the Mediterranean 
countries seem to share some characteristics with the 
conservative  Continental  countries.  From  some 
viewpoints, they are not considered ‘an intrinsically 
distinct model, but rather a less developed continental 
one’ (Berghman, 1997: 125) or ‘a discount edition of 
the continental model’ (Abrahamson, 1995). 

In a second step, the ten post-communist countries 
were incorporated in the cluster analysis. The results 
of  the  hierarchical  cluster  analysis  presented  in 
Figure 2 support the insight that instead of forming 
a unique Eastern European welfare regime, welfare 

policy patterns in the CEE have developed in differ-
ent directions (see also Cerami, 2006; Inglot, 2008; 
Szikra  and  Tomka,  2009).  On  the  one  hand,  the 
Baltic  countries,  along  with  Slovakia,  Bulgaria, 
Romania  and  Poland,  form  a  distinctive  cluster  of 
their own, which might be described as the develop-
ing Eastern European cluster. On the other hand, the 
rest of the CEE countries join one of the predomi-
nantly  Western  European  clusters.  While  Slovenia 
shares features of the Southern European cluster, the 
Czech  Republic  and  Hungary  group  together  with 
Spain, Luxemburg and Ireland in the Mixed cluster. 

Robustness of the clusters

The  robustness  of  the  clusters  produced  by  the 
hierarchical cluster analysis was first tested by uti-
lizing  another  agglomerative  hierarchical  clustering 
method  –  the  complete  linkage  method.  For  this 
method, the cluster criterion is based on maximum 
distance between a pair of objects residing in different

clusters. This method is not as sensitive for outliers 
than the Ward’s method, but tends to build compact 
and  equally  sized  clusters  with  equal  diameters 
(Everitt et al., 2001). While the clusters iterated by 
the hierarchical cluster analysis using Ward’s method 
remain fairly stable, a few countries now join another 
cluster. Italy changes from the Southern European to 

the  Continental  cluster,  but  is  still  clearly  distinct 
from  the  other  members  of  this  group.  The 
Netherlands now joins the Nordic group and links 
most  closely  to  Finland.  The  Southern  European 
cluster now is also closer to the Eastern European and 
the Mixed ones, the Nordic and the Continental clus-
ters are independent in the initial splitting.

Second, the hierarchical cluster analysis was run 
with the original four spending categories instead of 
the factor scores for checking whether the selection 
of  the  variables  has  an  impact  on  the  extracted  
clusters.  Basically,  the  same  clusters  appear,  but 
some of the countries now join other clusters. The 
Netherlands  is  part  of  the  Nordic  cluster  while 
Iceland, Norway and Ireland form their own cluster 
which affiliates to the Mixed cluster at a later stage. 
In  addition,  the  UK  is  now  part  of  the  Southern 
European cluster. As previously mentioned however, 
this  procedure  might  be  sensitive  to  distortions 
caused by multicollinearity, which is why using the 
factor scores was chosen in the first place.

Third, it was tested how countries cluster when 
setting  the  number  of  clusters  a  priori  by  running 
the  partitioning  k-means  clustering  procedure 
(KCA).  The  rationale  behind  this  is  that  we  first 
make  theoretical  assumptions  about  the  expected 
number of clusters and then see how our observa-
tions group empirically into the defined number of 
clusters.  The  number  of  clusters  was  set  at  three 
(corresponding  to  the  original  three  worlds  of 
Esping-Andersen  (1990)),  four  (the  former  plus  a 
Southern  cluster)  and  five  (the  former  plus  an 
Eastern  European  cluster  or  the  five  ‘families  of 
nations’  identified  by  Castles  (2008)).  The  three-
cluster solution produces one cluster identical to the 
Nordic  one  in  the  hierarchical  cluster  analysis,  a 
second cluster consisting of the Continental and the 
Southern  European  countries  and  a  third  cluster 
which  combines  the  Eastern  European  and  the 
Mixed  groups.  In  the  four-cluster  solution,  the 
developing welfare states of Eastern European coun-
tries now separate into their own cluster; and finally 
the five-cluster solution reveals an identical pattern 
as the hierarchical cluster analysis. 

Finally, given the relatively small number of cases, 
the cluster analysis was also run with the jack-knife 
method  in  order  to  test  whether  the  results  are 
driven by single cases. This is not the case. Summing 
up the results of these robustness tests, we can con-
clude  that  the  patterns  found  in  the  hierarchical 
cluster analysis are robust.

Characteristics of the welfare spending 
patterns across the country clusters

What are, then, the constitutive patterns of welfare 
spending of the five country clusters? The original 

and  the  needs-adjusted  spending  figures  for  the 
means of 2005–7, in distinct welfare policy catego-
ries,  are  presented  in  Table  3  for  all  28  European 
countries. At the most general level, the clusters are 
distinguished  by  their  overall  level  of  total  social 
spending as a percentage of GDP. The average total 
spending  is  highest  in  the  group  of  conservative 
Continental  European  countries,  followed  by  the 
Nordic  countries.  The  variation  in  the  Southern 
cluster is lowest in the whole sample and highest in 
the Nordic cluster. This is especially due to the very 
high  total  spending  level  in  Sweden  –  the  highest 
among the European countries – and the moderate 
spending  level  in  Iceland.  The  countries  in  the 
Southern  European  cluster  also  show  rather  high 
overall spending levels, with Poland as an exception 
in  this  regard.  The  Eastern  European  cluster  is  in 
turn  characterized  by  very  modest  overall  social 
spending proportionate to their GDP. Welfare policy 
in these post-communist countries thus has far less 
priority in governmental budgeting as in the other 
European  countries.  The  Mixed  group  is  situated 
between  the  Eastern  and  the  Southern  European 
country clusters. 

The Continental cluster is furthermore character-
ized by high cash spending on age-related benefits. 
While  all  other  categories  also  show  rather  high 
spending levels, spending on social services is far less 
pronounced in terms of proportional governmental 
spending. This is in line with the traditional focus 
of  the  conservative-corporatists  or  Bismarckian 
welfare states on contribution-based social security 
benefits and only ‘essential’ welfare services including 
healthcare (for example, Palier, 2010). The UK is to 
a  certain  extent  an  outlier  in  this  group,  not  only 
because its spending on working-age cash benefits is 
considerably lower than the other countries of this 
group, but also because it groups with these coun-
tries in the first place. Originating from the univer-
salistic  idea  of  welfare  by  Beveridge,  the  welfare 
system in the UK should actually be in strict contrast 
to the conservative–corporatist welfare states of this 
cluster and their Bismarckian tradition. Yet the con-
temporary British welfare state represents a hybrid 
model that hardly corresponds to any of the ideal-
typical  welfare  regimes  (Cochrane  and  Clarke, 
1997: 73). It is often considered coming closest to 
the liberal regime following the original attribution 
by  Esping-Andersen,  although  the  UK  features  
the  characteristics  of  the  liberal  regime  on  the

decommodification  and  stratification  dimension 
only to a modest degree (Esping-Andersen, 1990). 
The  liberal  character  is  expressed  among  other 
things in the low generosity of income replacement 
through cash benefits, thus at least partly explaining 
the  below-average  spending  on  working-age  cash 
benefits.  The  British  system  furthermore  contains 
attributes  of  the  conservative  regime  type  in  that 
social security benefits dominate over public welfare 
services in importance (Schmid, 2010: 187). 

The  Southern  European  cluster  shares  the  high 
cash spending on age-related issues and the relative 
importance of healthcare services spending with the 
Continental  cluster.  Working-age  cash  spending 
and social services in turn are far less pronounced 
in  these  countries.  Healthcare  services  make  up 
about  the  same  relative  importance  in  relation  to 
total social spending as in the Continental cluster. 
This cluster can be seen as a more rudimentary and 
family-oriented variant of the conservative welfare 
state  (see  also  Esping-Andersen,  1999;  Ferrera, 
1996). 

The countries of the Nordic cluster show consid-
erably higher levels of spending for social services, 
on average well over twice as high as those of the 
nearest cluster – the Continental. The emphasis on 
welfare services such as childcare and old-age care 
facilities is a well-known feature of the social-dem-
ocratic welfare model and the supply of social care 
services  outside  the  family  sphere  accounts  deci-
sively  in  the  defamilizing  character  of  the  Nordic 
welfare  states  (Bambra,  2007;  Esping-Andersen, 
1990,  1999;  Kautto,  2002;  Korpi,  2000;  Jensen, 
2008;  Palme  et  al.,  2009).  But  high  working-age 
cash  expenditure  is  likewise  characteristic  for  the 
Nordic cluster, reflecting the generous benefit levels, 
universal  eligibility  criteria  and  high  coverage  of 
social  security  benefits  typical  for  these  countries. 
One  of  the  benefit  categories  accounting  for  the 
relatively high cash benefits in the working phase of 
life is child benefits and cash benefits for parental 
leave, with Nordic countries offering the most gen-
erous benefits in this category. The Nordic welfare 
cluster is thus characterized by welfare spending pri-
orities resulting both in a high level of defamilizing 
and decommodifying measures. Age-related spend-
ing is proportionally lower than spending on cash 
benefits for the working-age population. Iceland is 
clearly a deviant case in this cluster, its expenditure 
on old- and working-age benefits are considerably 

lower than in the rest of the Nordic countries. 

The Eastern European cluster shows low overall 
levels  of  spending  in  all  categories  and  the  Baltic 
countries, Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia and Poland 
can therefore be titled as developing or minimalistic 
welfare states. Social services have barely any com-
parative significance, with the percentage of spend-
ing in this category, in most cases, not even exceeding 
1  percent  of  GDP.  Poland  differs  to  some  extent 
from the other countries of this cluster, its spending 
in  old-age  benefits  is  considerably  higher,  while 
working-age cash benefits is somewhat higher than 
the average of the cluster. In general, when looking 
at the proportions of different spending categories 
in  relation  to  total  social  spending,  this  country 
cluster  strongly  exhibits  the  proportions  prevalent 
in the conservative Continental cluster. The hypoth-
esis  that  the  conservative  or  Bismarckian  model 
reflects  the  characteristics  of  the  emerging  welfare 
state  types  in  the  post-communist  countries  thus 
seems to hold true (Cerami, 2006; Inglot, 2008). It 
remains to be seen whether social matters will gain 
importance  within  governmental  spending  strate-
gies in the longer run, if these countries’ GDPs con-
verge with the established welfare states. 

Finally,  the  countries  in  the  Mixed  cluster  also 
show  a  pattern  similar  to  the  Continental  cluster, 
with the age-related cash spending being the most 
important category, followed by working-age cash 
benefits, healthcare services and finally social serv-
ices. As this cluster is rather heterogeneous, it does 
not seem appropriate to characterize the countries 
included in this cluster as a unique type of welfare 
state.  These  countries  might  still  be  developing  in 
different directions. 

Summing up, the clusters that resulted from the 
hierarchical  cluster  analysis  are  characterized  by 
very  distinct  patterns  of  welfare  spending  and 
varying emphases on functionally different domains 
of social protection and welfare provision. By and 
large, these clusters are in accordance with the ones 
identified by Castles (2008), although single coun-
tries group differently. Given the analogies in spend-
ing  profiles  of  the  Continental,  the  Southern,  and 
the Eastern clusters identified in this study, and the 
clearly  deviating  spending  pattern  of  the  Nordic 
cluster, the main dividing line in welfare effort and 
underlying  welfare  policy  arrangements  in  Europe 
seems to be constituted by whether welfare policy 
focuses on the provision of social services and cash

transfers  for  the  working-age  population  or  on 
social  security  via  cash  transfers  especially  for 
people in retirement. 

Although the dynamics of welfare spending pat-
terns  is  not  in  the  focus  of  this  study,  it  is  finally 
worth mentioning that especially the Scandinavian 
and the Continental cluster remain very stable over 
time since the mid 1990s, the period for which dis-
aggregated  data  for  these  countries  is  available. 
There  is  more  fluctuation  in  the  Mixed  and  the 
Southern cluster. The Southern cluster only formed 
in 2003, at least in the constellation with which it 
has been identified in this study. Before that, Greece 
and Portugal group together with the Mixed cluster 
while Slovenia and Italy are more clearly connected 
to  the  Continental  group.  Ireland  resembles  the 
Baltic countries in the late 1990s and early 2000s, 
possibly reflecting the common liberal character of 
these  welfare  states.  Iceland  represents  another 
interesting case, moving from the liberal and Mixed 
groups to the Scandinavian family by the turn of the 
millennium.  The  higher  dynamics  in  the  Mixed, 
Southern  and  of  course  Eastern  European  clusters 
seem  to  support  the  developing  character  of  the 
welfare states in these clusters. 

Conclusion
This article has made an attempt to refine the disag-
gregated  welfare  expenditure  approach  by  using 
it  to  identify  patterns  of  welfare  spending  in  28 
European countries. The analysis was based on the 
approach introduced by Castles (2008), but amend-
ments  were  made  both  in  conceptual  terms  and 
regarding  the  treatment  of  the  data.  A  way  of 
accounting for needs pressure factors, which inevi-
tably affect the comparability of the levels of social 
spending across countries, was applied by weight-
ing the data.

The results initially demonstrate that, contrary to 
the conclusions of some earlier studies, welfare policy 
effort does not seem to be bifurcated in cash trans-
fers and services in the sense that these would build 
the main dimensions around which welfare regimes 
cluster.  Instead,  welfare  states  in  Europe  differ  pri-
marily with regard to the extent to which they invest 
either on income maintenance in old-age or in social 
services  and  cash  transfers  to  working-age  popula-
tion. The spending priorities of different welfare state 
types, which constitute the two dimensions of welfare 

spending, thus reflect a divergent political response to 
the different social risks during distinct periods of the 
life cycle. 

Second,  divergent  welfare  spending  patterns 
indeed  can  be  identified  along  these  functionally 
different  dimensions  of  welfare  expenditure.  The 
mature  European  welfare  states  cluster  in  a  way 
which coincides largely with the regimes or worlds 
of  welfare  identified  in  previous  studies.  The 
welfare policy patterns of the CEE countries attest 
to the emergence of a variety of welfare arrange-
ments in the post-communist region. Common to 
all CEE countries, though, is a general orientation 
in  the  direction  of  Bismarckian  or  Continental 
model and the overall lower spending ratios pro-
portionate  to  GDP  compared  with  most  Western 
European countries. 

These results suggest that theoretically important 
distinctions between different types of welfare states 
can indeed be empirically drawn from disaggregated 
spending data. Welfare regimes do not only differ in 
their institutional settings rooted in the conception 
of social rights, but also in their budgetary emphasis 
on  different  welfare  policy  targets.  The  linkage  of 
spending  patterns  and  institutional  features  there-
fore  poses  an  interesting  theoretical  and  empirical 
puzzle, demonstrating that expenditure figures have 
more to offer in comparative welfare policy analysis 
than is often presumed. The disaggregated spending 
approach  is  attractive  and  fruitful  for  quantitative 
comparative  analysis  of  welfare  states  and  public 
policies also because data is available, thus providing 
options to expand the scope of analysis for countries 
neglected in comparative settings so far. Disaggregated 
data  further  facilitates  causal  analysis  in  pooled 
cross-sectional  time-series  settings  and  the  analysis 
of spatial dynamics in welfare policy development. 

As  with  all  measures,  one  must  carefully  define 
and  disclose  the  theoretical  and  analytical  limits 
when using disaggregated expenditure data. Yet the 
disaggregated expenditure approach and the avail-
able  data  provide  comparative  scholars  with  an 
appropriate  tool  for  analysing  welfare  policy  pat-
terns and their change as both dependent and inde-
pendent  variables,  thus  being  better  that 
its 
reputation.  The  data  opens  up  a  great  variety  of 
potential  research  directions.  The  next  steps  in 
advancing  this  approach  should  include  a  more  
in-depth  linking  of  spending  patterns  with  the  
theoretical  substance  of  the  different  institutional

settings of the worlds of welfare, as well as an anal-
ysis  of  programme-  and  function-specific  develop-
ments.  The  determinants  and  consequences  of 
welfare spending patterns also invite further analy-
sis. While the causal mechanisms behind the forma-
tion of welfare regimes in general presumably also 
account for explaining the spending patterns per se, 
testing how domestic political, socio-demographical 
and international factors shape welfare spending for 
different social needs and clientele certainly adds to 
our  understanding  of  welfare  policy  dynamics. 
Analysing the causes of the emerging welfare spend-
ing  patterns  in  the  post-communist  countries  pro-
vides  a  further  research  avenue  arising  from  the 
empirical  classification  of  the  CEE  countries.  For 
example, have similar political power constellations 
during  the  1990s  brought  about  the  Bismarckian 
type welfare states in the CEE as was the case earlier 
with the continental European countries? Likewise, 
the development of the spending patterns and con-
sequent  clusters  calls  for  in-depth  analysis,  espe-
cially in the face of the international demographic 
and  budgetary  pressures.  Finally,  considering  the 
interest of many comparative approaches to include 
both  mature  and  developing  welfare  states  in  the 
analysis,  finding  ways  to  synthesize  SOCX  and 
ESSPROS data is one of the challenges quantitative 
welfare state scholars should address in the future. 

Notes
I  would  like  to  thank  Olli  Kangas,  Detlef  Jahn,  Lyle 
Scruggs, Nils Düpont, Douglas Voigt and the participants 
of  the  stream  ‘Comparative  Methodology.  Neglected 
Issues and Innovative Methods: Identifying Best Practice’ 
at the 8th ESPAnet Conference 2010, as well as the two 
anonymous referees and the editor of this journal for their 
extremely  helpful  comments  on  earlier  versions  of  this 
paper. The research on which this paper is partly based is 
funded  by  the  German  Research  Foundation  DFG, 
Research project ‘Welfare Policies in the Enlarged Europe’ 
(JA 638/12–1, http://welfare.uni-greifswald.de).

  1.  The  data  provided  in  the  Comparative  Welfare 
Entitlements  Dataset  (CWED)  by  Lyle  Scruggs  (18 
OECD  countries,  1960/1970–2002,  available  at 
http://www.sp.uconn.edu/~scruggs/wp.htm)  and 
in 
the  Social  Citizenship  Indicator  Program  (SCIP)  by 
Walter Korpi and Joakim Palme (18 countries, 1930–
2000 in mainly 5-year sequences, available at https://
dspace.it.su.se/dspace/handle/10102/7),  are  valuable 
exceptions in this regard. Nevertheless, the temporal 
and spatial scope of these datasets limits the analytical 
focus that can be addressed. 

4. 

(2002, 2004).
I use means of these 3 years, 2007 being the last year 
for which data are currently available. While a simple 
cross-sectional analysis is always sensitive for outliers 
or coincidental values, using means for more than just 
1 year diminishes the random character of cross-sec-
tional analysis and also the risk measurement errors.

2.  Data are especially scarce when longer time series, coun-
tries  outside  the  OECD  world  and/or  the  entity  of 
welfare policy arrangements are the focus of the analysis.
3.  For an earlier, slightly different approach, see Castles 

5.  Age-related cash 0.791**, working-age cash 0.947**, 
healthcare 0.705** and other services 0.969**. For 
this  comparison,  spending  on  active  labour  market 
policies (ALMP) was not included in the working-age 
cash expenditure, as was done in the original catego-
ries by Castles (2008).

6.  For example, in 2006, the rate of unemployed of total 
labour force varied between 3.0 percent (Iceland) and 
13.9 percent (Poland). The ratio of population aged 
65  yearsand  over  of  the  total  population  varied 
between  11.0  percent  (Ireland)  and  19.8  percent 
(Italy) and the ratio of children under school age of 
the  total  population  between  6.1  percent  (Bulgaria) 
and 9.9 percent (Ireland) (data from Eurostat).

7.  Statutory  retirement  age  varies  across  countries,  65 
years being the most common official retirement age 
for (male) employees. The de facto average exit age 
was  61.2  years  in  the  EU25  in  2007  (European 
Commission, 2009). 

8.  The age limits for childcare allowance vary greatly, but 
in most countries, cash benefits are paid at least until 
the age of 16 years. The measure used here has there-
fore to be regarded as a very rough approximation.

9.  Again,  school  entry  age  varies  across  Europe,  but  in 
most countries children enter primary school at latest at 
the  age  of  7  years  and  are  thereafter  not  in  need  of 
daycare facilities anymore. Of course, family benefits are 
not restricted to daycare facilities, but these make out the 
greatest financial share of family benefits in kind.

10.  For calculating the weighting factor, the maximum life 
expectancy in the sample (82.16 years, Switzerland in 
2008) was set at 100 and all other values were then 
indexed along this benchmark. 

11.  In addition, the robustness of the factor solution was 
tested  by  applying  an  orthogonal  rotation  method 
(Varimax). The results are almost identical with the 
oblique rotated solution (Oblimin) reported in Table 
2. Given that factors are rarely truly orthogonal in the 
real world and given the correlations between some of 
the spending categories included in this analysis, the 
oblique  rotation  is  the  first  choice.  But  since  the 
oblique rotation produces factors that are orthogonal, 
that is, uncorrelated, we can be sure that the factor 
results are not an artifact of the choice of rotation. At 
the same time, the factor scores accessing the cluster 
analysis are not correlated to a significant degree (cf. 
Kline, 1994; Pett et al., 2003). 

12.  In order to avoid misleading terminology and keeping 
in  mind  the  explorative  character  of  this  study,  I 
abstain  from  using  more  content-specific  attributes

for the clusters, but instead use geographic terms (see 
also  Castles  and  Obinger,  2008;  Ferrera,  1996).  To 
some  extent,  though,  these  geographic  labels  are  of 
course  connoted  with  the  common  characteristics 
underlying the regimes or worlds of welfare, be it of a 
cultural,  societal  or  political  nature.  In  some  cases, 
these labels do not do justice to single countries in the 
literally geographic sense (for example, Great Britain 
in the ‘Continental’ cluster).

13.  Since most of the ‘liberal’ or ‘Anglo-Saxon’ countries 
(the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand) to which 
Great  Britain  and  Ireland  usually  are  attached  are 
excluded from this analysis, the formation of such a 
cluster is unlikely per definition, though.
