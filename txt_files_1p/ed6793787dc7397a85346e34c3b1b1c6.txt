 The history of the variable in psychology 

  Term has its origin in statistics (introduced by the man who originated the correlation 

coefficient) 

  First extensive use of (in-)dependent and intervening variables in 1930s 
  Our measures are a limited sample of possible measures of whatever it is we are interested 

in theoretically 

  We need to explore more deeply the definition of the concept at the theoretical level. 

Types of variables 

  2 types of meanings: primarily of theoretical and conceptual interest or primarily statistical in 

nature. 

  Variables do not readily fall into one category. Sometimes psychologists have taken statistical 

terminology and absorbed it into their professional vocabulary to refer to slightly different 
things.  

Independent and dependent variables 

  Consider true-experiment: manipulated variable = independent variable 
  Measured variable = dependent variable 
  The dependent variable is subject to the influence of the independent variable. The 
independent variable is the manipulated variable and the dependent variable is the 
measured value which is expected to be influenced by the manipulated variables.  

  Not so clear in non-experimental designs 
  Characteristic s of the participant are called subject variables 

Measurement characteristics of variables 

  Measurement is the process of assigning individuals to the categories or values of a variable. 
Different variables have different measurement characteristics which need to be understood 
in order to plan and execute research effectively. 

  Distinction: nominal vs quantitative measurements
