Abstract

The CagA protein of Helicobacter pylori interacts with numerous cellular factors, and is
associated with increased virulence and risk of gastric carcinoma. We present here the co-crystal
structure of a subdomain of CagA with the human kinase PAR1b/MARK2, revealing that a CagA
peptide mimics substrates of this kinase family, resembling eukaryotic protein kinase inhibitors.
Mutagenesis of conserved residues central to this interaction renders CagA inactive as an inhibitor
of MARK2.

Helicobacter pylori infects nearly 50% of the human population1,2 and has been closely
linked to duodenal and gastric ulcers and adenocarcinomas1. CagA is injected by H. pylori
into the epithelial cells lining the stomach3-8. Critical to many of the identified biological
effects of the molecule on host cells, is the so-called “repeats domain,” a region with a
strain-specific number of contiguous repeats of a 30-40 residue segment containing the
EPIYA amino acid motif (Fig. 1a)7. The repeats domain interacts with and inhibits the
PAR1/MARK (partitioning defective and MAP/microtubule affinity regulating kinases)
family of protein serine/threonine kinases9-11.

In order to understand the mechanism of CagA inhibition of PAR1/MARK kinases, we
determined the 2.2 Å crystal structure of MARK2 in complex with a sub-domain of CagA
spanning residues 885-1005 of Western H. pylori strain 26695, containing the A, B, and C
EPIYA repeats (Fig. 1, a and b, Table 1, and Supplementary Methods). Surprisingly, the
majority of this 120 amino acid CagA domain was not visible in the crystals (although
highly stable in complex with MARK2, and verified to be present by SDS-PAGE analysis of
crystals, Supplementary Fig. 1a). In particular, the EPIYA motifs were disordered, and only
a short 14 amino acid peptide possessed interpretable electron density (Fig. 1b and
Supplementary Fig. 1b). The peptide does not adopt any clear secondary structure, but
interacts with the kinase as an extended coil, burying approximately 950 Å2 of surface area.

Two significant differences are present between the unbound12 and the CagA-bound forms
of MARK2, and both are structural hallmarks of kinases in their fully activated state. The
first difference is an overall hinge motion between the N and C-terminal lobes of the kinase
that brings them closer together in the presence of CagA (Supplementary Fig. 1c). This
hinge motion is the same in each of the four independent copies of MARK2 in the
asymmetric unit, making it unlikely that this is due to crystal packing. The second major
difference is in the activation loop of the kinase, which adopts an ordered and activated
structure in the presence of CagA (Fig. 1c)13-16, including the conformation of the canonical
Asp-Phe-Gly (DFG) motif that is required for magnesium binding, and the position of a
threonine (Thr208 in MARK2) that is phosphorylated by activating kinases. These
conformational states are remarkable for the fact that there is no nucleotide or magnesium
present in the crystals, and no phosphorylation of Thr208.

What makes this activated conformation of the kinase possible, even in the absence of
several elements normally required, is the CagA peptide. The visible peptide spans the
sequence FPLKRHDKVDDLSK, a repeat motif occurring twice in the crystallized
construct. The peptide visible in the crystals, and which we show to be sufficient for
inhibition of the kinase, we have termed “MKI,” for MARK2 Kinase Inhibitor, in analogy
to PKI that inhibits PKA (vide infra).

Because the MKI sequence occurs twice in the crystallized construct, and only the amino
acids common to both repeats are visible, it was unclear from the crystal structure which of
the two possible peptide regions is binding (the first or second repeat of the MKI sequence).
We addressed this issue through a combination of gel filtration chromatography and native
mass spectrometry. These results (Supplementary Figs. 2-5, and Supplementary Tables 1-3)
clearly demonstrate that each MKI sequence is bound by a molecule of MARK2.

The MKI peptide of CagA occupies the substrate-binding site of the kinase that is located
near the interface between the N- and C-terminal lobes of the enzyme, using several amino
acids to mimic conserved features of the PAR1 and AMPK family substrates (Fig. 2, a and
b). The peptide is anchored to the kinase by four primary residues: Leu950, Arg952, Val956
and Leu959, numbering from the first repeat (Fig. 2a). Hydrophobic residues, especially
leucine, are highly conserved at the corresponding positions in PAR1/MARK family kinase
substrates (Fig. 2b), and the arginine at position 952 is also very well conserved. Several
secondary interactions further stabilize the interaction - Phe948, His953, and Lys955, the
last of which positions its terminal nitrogen atom in a location that mimics magnesium,
forming hydrogen bonds with Asp193 of the MARK2 DFG motif (Fig. 2a). Overall, seven
out of fourteen side-chains in the peptide interact with the kinase.

Intriguingly, the manner in which the CagA MKI sequence binds in the substrate-binding
cleft is remarkably reminiscent of the manner in which PKI binds to and inhibits PKA (Fig.
2c, refs15,16). A superposition of the two kinases bound to their inhibitors reveals that CagA
residues 951-956 possess an overlapping main-chain conformation to residues 17-22 of PKI,
and bind in a very similar location with respect to PKI in PKA (Fig. 2c). In addition to the
location and main-chain conformational analogies, several side-chains of these kinase
inhibitors interact with their targets in similar ways. For example, Arg18 of PKI is located
very comparably to Arg952 of CagA (Fig. 2c), and both residues make hydrogen bonds with
a conserved glutamic acid nearly identically positioned in the two kinases (Glu127 in PKA,
and Glu136 in MARK2). Both peptides also use a short hydrophobic residue at the position
of CagA Val956 (Ile22 in PKI) to insert into a conserved hydrophobic pocket in the kinases
(Fig. 2c).

To test the importance of these side-chain interactions, a series of mutants were created in
the MKI sequence of CagA. In order to prevent the second MKI sequence from biasing
results, these mutants were made in a construct in which one MKI site was deleted (the
construct spanning residues 885-981, see Fig. 1a), as well as in synthetic peptides
corresponding to the minimal region defined by the crystal structure. Hexa-histidine–tagged
CagA mutants were first examined for binding and co-elution with un-tagged MARK2 from
Ni-NTA (Fig. 3a). Point mutations of key anchoring residues, such as L950G and L959G,
completely abolished binding to MARK2. The R952G mutant exhibited weak binding (Fig.
3a), but interaction was highly unstable, however, and the complex was disrupted by ion
exchange chromatography. The mutation V956G almost completely eradicated binding to
MARK2, highlighting the importance of this hydrophobic interaction with the kinase. We
also created two MARK2 mutants, encompassing CagA interacting residues E136G, F138G,
and D139G in one construct (EFD), and L248G and D251G in the second (LD). EFD
mutations completely abolished interaction between MARK2 and CagA, consistent with
their interaction with key CagA binding residues (Leu950 and Arg952), whereas the LD
mutants did not.

Both basal MARK2 kinase activity (Fig. 3b), as well as activated kinase activity using
MARKK (Fig. 3c), were tested in vitro in the presence of varying concentrations of short
peptides containing the wild type and mutant constructs of the MKI sequence. Synthetic
peptides of CagA containing mutations in key interacting residues (Leu950, Arg952,
Val956, or Leu959) failed to inhibit kinase activity except at extremely high concentrations
(100μM). In contrast, the wild type peptide and the K955G mutant were very efficient
inhibitors of MARK2. Intriguingly, the K955G peptide was a slightly more potent inhibitor
of MARK2 than wild type (Fig. 3c, d). Supporting this data, East-Asian CagA subtypes
contain glycine in the position that corresponds to Lys955 in Western CagA, and it has been
reported that MARK2 binds more strongly to the East Asian CagA repeats region17.

This structure reveals that CagA mimics host substrates, using a short, 14 amino acid
peptide (MKI) to bind to the kinase substrate-binding site (see also Supplementary
Discussion and Supplementary Figure 6). Our biochemical experiments demonstrate that
this peptide alone is sufficient to inhibit MARK2. In a dramatic example of convergent
evolution, H. pylori has evolved a peptide to mimic host substrates of this kinase family in
order to manipulate eukaryotic cellular biochemistry during infection.
