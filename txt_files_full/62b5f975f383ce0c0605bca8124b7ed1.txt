•  phosphorylation by a different kinase, the Wee1p kinase, inhibits

kinase complex  

3)  True or false: the regulation of cyclin-CDK enzyme complexes depends 

entirely on phosphorylation and dephosphorylation 

 

4)  A living lung epithelial cell is shown at different stages in M phase (next 
slide); order these micrographs into the correct sequence and identify 
the stage in M phase that each represents 

5)  Blocking phosphorylation of lamin, a component of the nuclear lamina, 

results in cell cycle arrest. Explain why. 

6)  During the cell cycle, every nucleotide of the genome must be 

duplicated only once. Describe how this is accomplished. 

7)  What are the two cytoskeletal machines that are assembled to carry out 
47 

the mechanical processes of mitosis and cytokinesis in animal cells?
