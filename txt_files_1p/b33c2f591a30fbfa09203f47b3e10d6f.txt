Abstract

In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, a cortical region in the right temporo-parietal junction (RTPJ) is
recruited when participants read stories about people’s thoughts (‘Theory of Mind’). Both fMRI and lesion studies suggest
that a region near the RTPJ is associated with attentional reorienting in response to an unexpected stimulus. Do Theory of
Mind and attentional reorienting recruit a single population of neurons, or are there two neighboring but distinct neural
populations in the RTPJ? One recent study compared these activations, and found evidence consistent with a single
common region. However, the apparent overlap may have been due to the low resolution of the previous technique. We
tested this hypothesis using a high-resolution protocol, within-subjects analyses, and more powerful statistical methods.
Strict conjunction analyses revealed that the area of overlap was small and on the periphery of each activation. In addition, a
bootstrap analysis identified a reliable 6–10 mm spatial displacement between the peak activations of the two tasks; the
same magnitude and direction of displacement was observed in within-subjects comparisons. In all, these results suggest
that there are neighboring but distinct regions within the RTPJ implicated in Theory of Mind and orienting attention.

Introduction

In fMRI studies, a cortical region in the right temporo-parietal
junction (RTPJ) is recruited when participants read stories about
people’s thoughts, relative to controls for logical and attentional
demands [1,2]. The blood oxygen level dependent
(BOLD)
response in this region is significantly higher when participants
read about false beliefs than during closely-matched stories about
false maps or signs [3], and is specific to thinking about thoughts
relative to other social information [4–6].

Both fMRI and lesion studies also suggest that a region near the
RTPJ is involved in attentional reorienting. In a Posner spatial-
cueing paradigm [7], activity in the RTPJ is
increased on
‘‘invalidly-cued’’ trials, when a target appears in an unexpected
location [8]. Similar activation has been observed during detection
of centrally presented low-frequency targets [9], suggesting that
the function of this region is in exogenously-cued redeployment of
attention. Damage to RTPJ is the most common cause of left
hemifield spatial neglect [10,11].

One obvious question is: do these findings reflect recruitment of
a single neural region, common to both Theory of Mind and
exogenous attention, or are there neighboring but distinct regions
within the RTPJ that account for these results? The discovery that
these two tasks share a common mechanism would be surprising
and informative, suggesting that the two tasks rely on common
psychological component process.

Caution is clearly necessary before we accept an observation that
two different tasks activate the ‘‘same’’ brain region in imaging
studies as evidence that common psychological mechanisms are

engaged. In standard fMRI methods, the large voxel-size, along with
the combined effects of partial-voluming, pooling due to shared
vasculature [12],
imperfect alignment during normalization and
group averaging, and spatial smoothing all conspire to bias fMRI
analyses towards findings of spurious overlap [13].

Mitchell [14] recently conducted the first direct comparison of
the Theory of Mind and exogenous attention tasks in the same
individuals. He reported overlap between the regions of RTPJ
recruited by the two tasks. For the reasons described above, these
results are potentially important but hard to interpret. We
therefore investigated whether there is real overlap between
regions recruited for Theory of mind and attentional reorienting,
and/or whether there is a reliable spatial separation between the
regions activated by the two tasks, using higher field strength (3T
versus 1.5T) and higher resolution (1.661.662.4 mm voxels,
versus 3.7563.7566 mm) than the previous study. To overcome
the limitations of
the weak attention effect, we use a non-
parametric bootstrap to estimate confidence intervals for the
relative locations of the peaks in group data. The bootstrap is a
computationally intensive method for assessing the uncertainty in
a statistical measure [15].
