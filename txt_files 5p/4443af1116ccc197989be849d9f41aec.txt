1. Introduction

Classical engineering approaches to the characterization of
real-world problems are based on essentially qualitative and
quantitative technique based on more or less accurate mathemat-
ical modelling. In such approaches expressions like ‘‘medium
temperature’’, ‘‘big humidity’’, ‘‘small pressure’’, ‘‘very big speed’’,

related to the variables speciﬁc to the behaviour of a controlled
process (CP), are subject to relatively difﬁcult interpretations from
the quantitative point of view. This interpretation is difﬁcult
because classical automation handles variables/information, pro-
cessed with well-speciﬁed numerical values. Therefore the
elaboration of the control strategy and its implementation in
the control equipment requires an as accurate as possible
quantitative modelling of the CP. Advanced control strategies
may require the permanent reassessment of the models and of the
values of the parameters characterizing the (parametric) models.
Process control based on fuzzy set theory or fuzzy logic) – referred
to as fuzzy control or fuzzy logic control – is more pragmatically
with this regard because use is made of the linguistic characteri-
zation of the quality of CP dynamics and of the adaptation of this
characterization as function of the concrete conditions of CP
operation.

Zadeh set the basics of fuzzy set theory by a paper that seemed
to be just mathematical entertainment about four decades ago
[1]. The boom in computer science opened in the seventies the
ﬁrst prospects for applications of the meanwhile built theory in
various ﬁelds ranging from control engineering, qualitative
modelling, pattern recognition, signal processing, information
processing, machine intelligence, decision making, management,
ﬁnance, medicine, and so on. In particular, fuzzy control, as one of
the earliest branches and applications of fuzzy sets and systems,
has become one of the most successful applications. Fuzzy
control has proven to be a successful control approach to many
complex nonlinear systems or even nonanalytic ones. It has been
suggested as an alternative approach to conventional control
techniques in many situations. This paper will be focused on
industrial applications, and the analysis is dedicated to the period
after 2000.

The ﬁrst fuzzy control application belongs to Mamdani and
Assilian [2,3], where control of a small steam engine is
considered. The reference applications of fuzzy control, associ-
ated by experiments, deal with a warm water plant [4] and with a
small scale heat exchanger [5]. Afterwards, during the eighties in
Japan, USA, and later, in Europe, a so-called fuzzy boom took
place in the ﬁeld of fuzzy control applications to several domains
beginning with electrical household industry and consumer
electronics up to other industries like mechanical and robotic
systems, power plants and systems, telecommunications, trans-
portation systems, automotive systems, chemical processes and
nuclear reactors. This boom was caused partly by the spectacular
development of electronic technology and computer systems
that enables:

- the manufacturing of circuits with very high speed of information
processing, dedicated (by construction and usage) to a certain
purpose including fuzzy information processing and resulting in
embedded systems,

- the development of computer-aided design programs, which
allow the control system designer to use efﬁciently a large
amount of information concerning the CP and the control
equipment.

The industrial applications of fuzzy control reported until now
emphasize two important aspects related to this control strategy:

- In some situations (for example, the control of processes with
functional nonlinearities which subjected to difﬁcult mathemat-
ical modelling and the control of ill-deﬁned processes), fuzzy
control can be viewed as a viable alternative to classical, crisp
control (conventional control),

- Compared to conventional control, fuzzy control can be strongly
based and focused on the experience of a human operator, and a

fuzzy controller can model more accurately this experience (in
linguistic manner) versus a conventional controller.

The main features of fuzzy control can be organised as follows:

- Fuzzy control employs the so-called fuzzy controllers (FCs) or
fuzzy logic controllers ensuring a nonlinear input–output static
map that can be inﬂuenced/modiﬁed based on designer’s option.
- Fuzzy control can process several variables from the CP, hence it
can be considered as belonging to the class of multi-input–multi-
output (MIMO) systems with interactions. Therefore the FC can
be considered as a multi-input controller (eventually, a multi-
output one, too), similar to linear or nonlinear state-feedback
controllers.

- FCs do not possess dynamics, but the applications and perform-
ance of FCs and fuzzy control systems (FCSs) can be enlarged
signiﬁcantly by inserting dynamics (i.e., derivative and/or
integral components) to fuzzy controller structures resulting
in the so-called fuzzy controllers with dynamics.

- FCs are ﬂexible with regard to the modiﬁcation of the transfer
features (by input–output static maps). Thus the possibility to
develop a large variety of adaptive control system structures is
offered.

The control approach based on human experience is acting in
FCs by expressing the control requirements and elaborating the
control signal in terms of the natural IF–THEN rules which belong
to the set of rules

:::
IF ðantecedentÞ THEN ðconsequentÞ;
:::

where the antecedent (premise) refers to the found out situation
concerning the CP dynamics (compared usually with the desired/
imposed dynamics), and the consequent (conclusion) refers to the
measures which should be taken – under the form of the control
signal u – in order to fulﬁl the desired dynamics. The set of rules (1)
makes up the rule base of the FC.

Research results obtained in studying the behaviour of the
human expert emphasize that the expert has a speciﬁc strongly
nonlinear behaviour accompanied by anticipative, derivative,
integral and predictive effects and by adaptation to the concrete
operating conditions. Colouring the linguistic characterization of
CP dynamics (and, accordingly, of fuzzy mathematical characteri-
zation) based on experience and translating it to the control signal
elaboration and the analysis of CP dynamics will be characterized
by parameters that enable the modiﬁcation of FC features. From
this point of view the FCSs can be regarded as belonging to the
general framework of intelligent control systems.

The block diagram of principle (considered as classical in the
literature) of an FCS is presented in Fig. 1. The FCS is considered as a
single input system with respect to the reference input r and as a

single output system with respect to the controlled output y. The
second input fed to the CP/FCS is the disturbance input d.

Fig. 1 highlights also the operation principle of an FC in its
classical version, characterizing Mamdani FCs, with the following
variables and modules:

(1) the crisp inputs,
(2) the fuzziﬁcation module,
(3) the fuzziﬁed inputs,
(4) the inference module,
(5) the fuzzy conclusions,
(6) the defuzziﬁcation module,
(7) the crisp output.

The essential, already mentioned, particular feature of FCSs
concerns the multiple interactions regarded from the process to
the controller by the auxiliary variables ya, gathered in the input
vector e0

These variables are direct or indirect inputs to the fuzzy
controller. No matter how many inputs to the FC are, the FC should
possess at least one input variable e1 that corresponds to the
control error e

(3)

According to Fig. 1, the operation principle of a Mamdani FC

involves the sequence of operations (a), (b) and (c):

(a) The crisp input information – the measured variables, the
reference input (the set point), the control error – is converted
into fuzzy representation. This operation is called fuzziﬁcation
of crisp information.

(b) The fuzziﬁed information is processed using the rule base,
composed of the fuzzy IF-THEN rules referred to as fuzzy
control rules of type (1) that must be well deﬁned in order to
control the given process. The principles to evaluate and
process the rule base represent the inference mechanism/
engine and the result is the ‘‘fuzzy’’ form of the control signal u,
the fuzzy control signal.

(c) The fuzzy control signal must be converted into a crisp
formulation, with well-speciﬁed physical nature, directly
understandable and usable by the actuator in order to be
capable of controlling the process. This operation is known
under the name of defuzziﬁcation.

The three operations described brieﬂy here characterize the
three modules in the structure of an FC (Fig. 1), the fuzziﬁcation
module (2), the inference module (4) and the defuzziﬁcation
module (6). All three modules are assisted adequate databases.

In the majority of applications an FC is used for direct feedback
control or on the low level
in hierarchical control system
structures. However, it can be used on the supervisory level, for
example in adaptive control system structures. Nowadays fuzzy
control is no longer only used to directly express the knowledge on
the CP or, in other words, to do model-free fuzzy control. An FC can
be calculated from a fuzzy model obtained in terms of system
identiﬁcation techniques, and thus it can be regarded in the
framework of model-based fuzzy control. Most often used are:

- Mamdani fuzzy controllers, referred to also as linguistic FCs, with
either fuzzy consequents that represent type-I fuzzy systems
according to the classiﬁcations given in [6] or singleton
consequents belonging to the type-II fuzzy systems. These FCs
are usually used as direct closed-loop controllers.

- Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy controllers, known also as type-III
fuzzy systems especially when afﬁne consequents are employed,
and typically used as supervisory controllers.

Several excellent books and tutorial articles on fuzzy control
are well-acknowledged [7–24]. Several survey and position
papers highlight speciﬁc topics in fuzzy control, make character-
izations and present points of view. A good survey on fuzzy
modelling for control is done in [25]. The stability analysis
methods for type-II fuzzy control systems are analyzed in detail in
[6]. A very good survey on neuro-fuzzy rule generation in a rather
general setting of soft computation is given in [26]. The fusion of
computational intelligent methodologies, including fuzzy logic
and sliding mode control,
is thoroughly discussed in [27].
Conclusions of great wisdom regarding the perspectives of fuzzy
control systems are pointed out in [28]. An excellent survey on
analysis and design methods of model based fuzzy control
systems is given in [29].

This paper is focused on industrial applications of fuzzy
control with application ﬁelds that include but are not limited to
manufacturing, robotics, automotive and process industry, and
control of servo systems and actuators as well. A large part of
these applications can be viewed in the framework of
mechatronic systems. The authors are aware of the fact that
the publications on the topic of fuzzy logic control are so huge
that an exhaustive list is impossible. Selected papers are given in
the end of this paper. Many excellent works are unfortunately
missed. In addition, this survey paper is not able to cover all
categories of industrial applications of fuzzy logic control in
detail.

The paper addresses the following topics. Industrial applica-
fuzzy controllers
tions of control systems with Mamdani
are discussed in Section 2. Next, Section 3 is focused on
control systems with Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy controllers. The stable
design of model-based fuzzy control systems and aspects
concerning the tensor product (TP) model transformation are
considered. Applications of adaptive and predictive fuzzy control
dealing with supervision and optimization, i.e., multi-level fuzzy
control systems, are presented in Section 4. Section 5 gives
concluding remarks, perspectives and challenges of
fuzzy
control.

2. Control systems with Mamdani fuzzy controllers

The design of FCSs with Mamdani FCs is usually performed by
heuristic means incorporating human skills and experience, and it
is often carried out by a model-free approach. The immediate
shortcoming resulted from the model-free design and FC tuning
concerns the lack of general-purpose design methods. Although
the performance indices of such control systems are generally
satisfactory, a major problem is the analysis of the structural
properties possessed by the FCSs including stability, controlla-
bility, parametric sensitivity and robustness [19,22–24,28]. In
addition, the design of such control systems suffers from the lack
of systematic approaches. Therefore much research attention has
been devoted to the stability analysis. Actual trends make use of
Lyapunov’s approach [30], Krasovskii’s approach [31],
the
describing function method [19], Krasovskii-LaSalle’s invariant
set
the small gain theorem [33], algebraic
approaches [34] including the vector norms approach [35,36],
applicable to Mamdani FCs but also with minor modiﬁcations to T-
S FCs. The common idea of all these approaches is to regard the FC
as a nonlinear controller with Lurie-Postnikov nonlinearity, the CP
with crisp model (linear or not) and embed the stability problem
of FCSs into the stability theory of conventional nonlinear
systems.

Several applications of FCSs with Mamdani FCs are reported
in manufacturing. They include control of industrial weigh belt
feeders [37], the realization of speciﬁc controllers [38,39],
control of machining processes [40–43], laser tracking systems
[44], plastic injection molding [45] and vibration suppression
[46]. The manufacturing area is related to robotics. Mamdani FCs
concern control of both manipulators and mobile robots [47–
60].

The automotive industry is one special successful area of
Mamdani FCs. Problems and practical issues related to suspension
control are discussed in [61]. The control of hybrid electric vehicles
is treated in [62] and the complexity of all related control strategies
is emphasized in [63]. The control of anti-lock braking systems is
analyzed in [64,65].

Process industries include Mamdani

fuzzy control. The
applications reported in this context tackle the control of furnaces
[66,67], ﬁltration processes [68], air conditioning [69,70], heat
exchangers [71] or forging machines [72].

Control systems should exhibit generally very good steady-
state, dynamic performance and robustness as well. Hence they
require high quality servo systems that ensure both stabilization
and tracking. The same problem is in case of complex control
systems where the actuators can be viewed as local control
systems with high needs as the performance is concerned. Servo
systems are widely used in mechatronics applications charac-
terized by tight coupling of different implementation techniques
including hydraulics, mechanics, electro-mechanics, electronics
and software [73–75]. Applications of these servo systems can
be found in electro-hydraulic systems, actuators in robots or
automotive systems, etc., where the CPs can be well character-
ized in simpliﬁed forms by benchmark systems [76–83]. One of
the actual trends in control systems for mechatronics is that
newer generations shall always be smaller, cheaper and/or
provide additional functionality [75]. One difﬁcult and chal-
lenging task coming from this is to devise cost-effective
solutions
these
systems. Fuzzy control has recently been applied to a variety
of servo systems and actuators in mechatronics [84–93].

that guarantee improved performance of

Aircraft, missile autopilot and helicopter control represent also
areas where fuzzy control
is applied ensure performance
improvements. The results outlined in these areas [94–102] can
be connected well to those dedicated to servo systems.

2.1. PI-, PD- and PID-fuzzy control

functionalities including anti-windup,

PI, PD and PID controllers are still the most widely used in
industrial control loops worldwide because they have simple
structures, can be designed easily and offer good control system
performance at acceptable cost [103]. The CS performance indices
provided by these PID controllers depend not only on the tuning
parameters, but also on the necessary implementation of
additional
feedforward
action, and set point ﬁltering [104]. However, PI, PD and PID
controllers might not ensure satisfactory control system perform-
ance if the mathematical model of the CP is highly nonlinear,
subjected to parameter variance, and/or uncertainties. On the
other hand, conventional fuzzy control is known for its ability to
cope with nonlinearities and uncertainties.
Introduction of
dynamic fuzzy controller structures with the aim of control
system performance improvement leads to PI-, PD- or PID-fuzzy
controllers [105–108]. Several Mamdani PI-fuzzy controllers (PI-
FCs), PD-fuzzy controllers (PD-FCs) and PID-fuzzy controllers (PID-
FCs) [109–111] as well as Takagi-Sugeno PI-FCs, PD-FCs and PID-
FCs [17,90,100,111] are developed.

PI-FCs, PD-FCs, and PID-FCs can be designed and tuned using

two approaches:

- the ﬁrst is based on the fact that under some well-stated
conditions, the approximate equivalence between linear and
fuzzy controllers is generally acknowledged [37,112–114],

- the second relies on the consideration of these fuzzy controllers
(FCs) as nonlinear PD, PI, or PID controllers with variable gains
[115–118].

The ﬁrst approach is considered as the direct action type of PI-
FCs, PD-FCs and PID-FCs [110] since the inference module
calculates the control signal (action) directly to control a system.
The second approach is viewed as gain scheduling [119,120].

Industrial implementations of PI-, PD- or PID-fuzzy controllers
involve both approaches although the gain scheduling was ﬁrst
accepted from industry [121]. Applications of PI-FCs, PD-FCs and
PID-FCs were classiﬁed and pointed out at the beginning of this
section. Other applications are reported in [118,122–128]. Several
topics of interest regarding PI-FCs, PD-FCs or PID-FCs, which are
well identiﬁed in [29], concern the industrial applications FC
tuning [117], optimal FCs by inserting genetic algorithms
[122,124,129–134] or neural networks [29,135–137], and robust
FCs [29,93,138–140].

2.2. Sliding mode fuzzy control

It is well acknowledged that sliding mode control exhibits
robustness properties [141]. So a natural direction is to embed this
property in fuzzy control. This will lead to the alleviation of the
negative effects due to the chattering phenomenon speciﬁc to
sliding mode control systems and the combination between the
two techniques, sliding mode and fuzzy control,
leads to
complementing the advantages of both ones.

Usual approaches to sliding mode control are:

- The sliding mode controller handles linguistic information
modelled by means of fuzzy processing with the elimination
of the chattering phenomenon by the creation of fuzzy boundary
layers [142–145].

- Supervisory sliding mode controller

is inserted to fuzzy
controller structures leading to the guarantee of stability and
improvement of robustness [146–150].

These approaches ensure the convenient treatment of FCS
stability analysis and design in the framework of the well
developed methods dedicated to sliding mode control. Symmetri-
cal FCs (as to their deﬁnition in an input–output matrix) can be
regarded as sliding mode controllers with multiple sliding lines.

2.3. 2-DOF fuzzy control

Since the main tasks in control, the achievement of high
performance in set-point tracking and the regulation in the
presence of disturbance inputs are difﬁcult to be accomplished by
means of PI and PID controllers, one typical approach is to design
two-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) controllers which have advan-
tages over the one-degree-of-freedom ones [151–153]. But, the
main drawback of 2-DOF controllers is that although they ensure
the regulation, the reduction of overshoot is paid by slower set-
point responses because the 2-DOF structures can be reduced to
feedforward controllers with set-point weighting.

The control performance enhancement with respect to the
modiﬁcations of set-point and of load disturbance inputs ensured
by the FCs in connection with the overcome of the above
mentioned drawback of 2-DOF controllers leads to the idea of 2-
DOF fuzzy controllers [154–158]. Very good control system
performance with respect to the set-point and disturbance input

can be obtained if the process with the transfer function of the
controlled process P(s) is included to the generic 2-DOF control
system structures presented in Fig. 2, referred to as the set-point
ﬁlter structure (Fig. 2(a)), the feedforward structure (Fig. 2(b)), the
feedback structure (Fig. 2(c)) and the component-separated
structure exempliﬁed for the 2-DOF PI controller (Fig. 2(d)),
where: r – the set-point, y – controlled output, e = r   y or e = r1   y
– the control error, u – the control signal, r1, u2, u2 and u4 – the
outputs of the blocks F(s), C(s) (in Fig. 2(b)), C*(s) and CI(s),
respectively, and d1, d2 and d3 – several load disturbance inputs
deﬁned in Fig. 2(e).

Some of the controller blocks in Fig. 2 can be fuzziﬁed in order to
improve the control system performance [158]. Similar structures
can be formulated under the form of state-feedback control
systems to be treated in the following sections.

3. Control systems with Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy controllers

T-S fuzzy models represent fuzzy dynamic models or fuzzy
systems [25,28,159,160]. This brings a twofold advantage. First,
any model-based technique (including a nonlinear one) can be
applied to the fuzzy dynamic models. Second, the controller itself
can be considered as a fuzzy system. Since the fuzzy model of the
nonlinear process is usually based on a set of local linear models
which are smoothly merged by the fuzzy model structure, a natural
and straightforward approach is to design one local controller for
each local model of the process. This idea is known as parallel
distributed compensation [18]. In parallel distributed compensa-
tion (PDC) the structure of the FC model matches the structure of
the fuzzy model of the CP.

The identiﬁcation of T-S fuzzy models is of great importance
generally for T-S FC designs and strictly necessary for PDC. Many
good results and applications with this respect are reported in
[16,18,29,161–166] where use is made of two approaches. The ﬁrst
one is to linearize the nonlinear model of the process in the vicinity
of important operating points assuming that the model of the
process is known for example in its ﬁrst principle form. The second
one, applied when the model of the process is unknown, is to make
use of the data generated (analytically or experimentally) from the
original nonlinear process. The second approach consists of two
steps, the structure identiﬁcation and the parameter estimation,
and it employs various techniques to solve the optimization
problem with the aim in ﬁtting the models to the pairs of input–
output data.

The industrial applications of T-S FCs were presented in the
previous section in close connection to those of Mamdani FCs.
However, due to the model-based design, most references offer
results concerning the stabilization of T-S fuzzy models.

for discrete T-S fuzzy models:

The main approach to solve the system of Eqs. (9) and (11)
makes use of linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based techniques
[168]. Popular approaches employ quadratic, piecewise quadratic,
non-quadratic, parameter-dependent, polynomial and fuzzy Lya-
punov functions [169–182], and they show the constant effort to
reduce the conservativeness of the stability conditions. Although
the LMIs are computationally solvable they require numerical
algorithms embedded in well acknowledged software tools.

The LMIs can be applied to other control system structures with
T-S FCs and models. They include the cascade control systems
[183] eventually with fuzzy observers [184] which are validated by
experiments and/or simulations.

3.2. Tensor product model transformation and fuzzy control systems

One of the current trends in fuzzy control is to derive less
conservative conditions to prove the stability and the performance
of FCSs [19,28,185]. The fuzzy partitions are the combinations of
the products of rather simple arguments expressed as membership
functions. In real-world applications one particular case concerns
fuzzy modelling of nonlinear systems under the form of TP fuzzy
systems. The expression of TP fuzzy systems can be understood in
terms of operations on multi-dimensional arrays [185].

The TP model transformation is capable of transforming a
dynamic system model, given over a bounded domain, into the TP
model form, including polytopic or T-S fuzzy model forms. The TP
model transformation may be deﬁned as one numerical method
capable of
transforming the linear parameter-varying (LPV)
dynamic models into parameter-varying weighted combination
of parameter independent (constant) system models under the
form of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. This transformation of
LPV models is uniform in both theoretical and algorithmic
execution and it considers different optimization constraints.
The main advantage of TP model transformation in modifying the
given LPV models to varying convex combinations of LTI models is
that the LMI-based control design frameworks can be applied
immediately to the resulting afﬁne models in order to get a
tractable and improved performance of the FCSs.

The widely applied transfer function of the product decision
operator-based T-S fuzzy models and the function of the TP model
is the same from the analytical point of view in widely general
cases. The main philosophical difference between them is that the
T-S fuzzy model originally means a fuzzy combination of locally
linearized LTI models, where the locality is expressed by the shape
of the antecedent fuzzy sets, for instance, by triangular fuzzy sets
where the location of the fuzzy set is readily determinable.
However in case of TP model the weighting functions (which
correspond to the membership functions in the fuzzy models) may
not have locality, they spread in the whole interval of interest, so as
the LTI components of the model cannot readily be assigned to a
deﬁnite operation point. They are mostly vertexes of a polytopic
structure. In conclusion, the T-S fuzzy model originally is a fuzzy
combination of linearized operation points (LTI systems are close
to local models), while the TP model is originally a polytopic
structure (LTI systems are the vertex models of a convex hull of the
model, they may be relatively far from any linearized operation
points). In other words, an LTI system affects a fuzzy local area in
case of T-S models. In the case of TP models an LTI system affects

the whole operation domain, but according to the weighting
functions. As a matter of fact, in today systems these two original
ideas are combined in both T-S and TP models, therefore the
difference is not important.

The TP model transformation generates two kinds of polytopic
models. Initially, it reconstructs the high order singular value
decomposition (HOSVD)-based canonical form of the LPV models.
The major outcome of the recently developed HOSVD comes from
its ability in decomposing a given N-dimensional tensor into a full
orthonormal system in a special ordering of higher order singular
values.

Regarding the variety of well acknowledged and implemented
identiﬁcation techniques, it is difﬁcult to derive the uniform
representation of the designed LPV model forms and the forms
resulted from the identiﬁcation. Hence the TP model transforma-
tion might be a possible solution for that situation, and an
immediate link between the model transformation and the LMIs
should be determined.

A key advantage of the TP model transformation is that it allows
the modiﬁcation of the parameter varying convex combination
according to the designer’s option. The type of the convex
combination considerably inﬂuences the further LMI design and
resulting control performance. Therefore the design can be based
on the manipulation of the convex hull beside the manipulation of
the LMIs.

Based on the core theory of the TP model transformation that is
coming from the singular value decomposition (SVD) methods
[186] the TP model transformation is capable of reducing the
complexity of TP structured functions like T-S fuzzy models or B-
spline models and so on. The multilinear generalizations of the SVD
and the investigation on how the tensor symmetries affect the
decomposition are discussed in [187]. The HOSVD has been
developed since the existing framework of vector and matrix
algebra; it appeared to be insufﬁcient as increasing number of
signal processing problems involved the manipulation of quanti-
ties of which the elements are addressed by more than two indices,
i.e., higher-order tensors. Use is made of higher-order tensors to
describe the transformations in the same way as the matrices
describe linear transformations between vector spaces.

Making use of the TP model transformation, different optimi-
zation and convexity constraints can be considered and the
transformations can be executed as well without any analytical
interactions within less time. Thus, the transformation replaces the
usual analytical conversions.

The LMI-based controller design methods can immediately be
applied after the transformation of the LPV model (14) given in
HOSVD-based canonical form to the TP model form expressed in (15)
and (16). In other words, the TP model transformation is to be used
and executed before utilizing the LMI design, i.e., when the LMI
design is started the global weighting functions are already deﬁned.
A short presentation of the applications of TP model transfor-
mation, well connected to T-S FCSs, is presented in [188] and
accompanied by a temperature control application. An attractive
control design method accompanied by application is given
[189,190] to stabilize parameter varying nonlinear state-space
models. It is based on two numerical steps. In the ﬁrst step the TP
model transformation is executed. In the second step LMIs are
solved under the PDC framework. The ﬁrst step consists in
transforming a given model into a TP, so that the design techniques
of the PDC framework can be employed. The operations associated
to the second step produce a controller according to various control
speciﬁcations. The advantages of this method are twofold. First, the
controller can be derived automatically, regardless of analytic
derivations. Second, the identiﬁed model can be deﬁned either by
analytical equations or by other soft computing techniques.

A popular TP model application deals with controlling the TORA
system [191] where a nonlinear controller has been designed
making use of the TP model transformation and a LMI-based
controller design technique. The results show that both numerical
methods, the TP model transformation and the LMIs, can be
accomplished numerically without analytical derivations, leading
to fast controller designs.

A case study regarding the TP model transformation behaviour
in real-world applications is discussed in [192] with focus on the
single pendulum gantry system. A generalization of the double
fuzzy summation results to multiple summations with a TP
structure is emphasized in [185]. This is meant to replace the well
accepted common structure in many fuzzy models. A simulated
application concerning the inverted pendulum system is included.
A Matlab toolbox for TP model transformation, the TP Tool, is
implemented and described in [193]. The toolbox is applied to
several benchmark systems and to the real-time control of the
liquid levels in a three tank system [194].

An excellent application of the TP model transformation deals
with offering a control solution for the aeroelastic wing section
problem that was considered as unsolved previously [195,196].
This is the ﬁrst convincing well detailed example of applying TP
model transformation with PDC design framework. It shows the
observer design as well.

4. Adaptive fuzzy control, supervision and optimization

There are many formations for the FC in FCSs similarly to the
different control schemes focused on PI controllers presented in
Fig. 2. An adaptive FC has one extra component, a supervisory
module, as shown in Fig. 3. The supervisory module has

values (centres) stay at the same position.

understanding of the process and of the controller, and has access
to all input and usually also to all output signals. The supervisory
module can modify several components of the fuzzy controller like
the size of the membership functions of the fuzzy sets, the position
of the membership functions, the rule weights and/or the link
values. These four items will be discussed below. A predictive FC
will be also described. That controller does not change the
parameters of the underlying FC, but it chooses every time the best
control signal based on a performance measure expressed in terms
of an objective function. The goal is to minimize the objective
function.

4.1. Adaptation of the size of the membership functions

The supervisor can change the size of the membership functions
of the fuzzy sets corresponding to the linguistic terms of the FC,
e.g., increase or decrease the support (width) of an individual
membership functions or change the width to the left-hand or
right-hand side, like in Fig. 4, applicable to both input and output
linguistic variables of
the fuzzy controller. The triangular
membership functions of the linguistic terms LT1, Lt2, LT3 and
LT4 were chosen in Fig. 4, with the parameters li; ri; i ¼ 1; 4.
Likewise, the spread s of Gaussian fuzzy sets can be adapted.

Actually, the adaptation means that the supervisor can change
the partitioning of the membership functions on the universe of
discourse. An example of this is a controller for the cruise control of
a car [197]. With cruise control the driver ﬁxes the speed of the car.
If the car goes uphill or downhill the cruise system controls the
throttle in such a way that the car keeps its velocity, if the driver
touches the break pedal or the ‘‘coach button’’ the cruise system
will stop working until the ‘‘resume button’’ is touched. By then,
the car will accelerate until it returns to the desired speed.
Depending on the load of the car and the weather conditions this
can lead to too fast or too slow acceleration and overshoot. The
supervisor should ‘‘learn’’ the load of the car and adapt the cruise
control to the current situation.

In [197] the system is described as in Fig. 5. The error in the
velocity is calculated from the vehicle and the reference speed, the
same holds for the ﬁrst and second derivative of the speed. The FC
calculates the throttle opening, passes it on to the actuator which
applies it to the vehicle. If the throttle opening is too slow or too
fast, i.e., the car accelerates too slow or to fast, the supervisor
changes the membership functions of the fuzzy sets corresponding

to the linguistic terms of the fuzzy controller. The supervisor has
four inputs: the error average value (EAV) and its ﬁrst derivative
(DEAV), the maximum value of the error (Verr) and the average
value of the throttle opening (UAV). The error average value and its
derivative give an indication how long it takes to bring the car back
to its desired speed. If the car accelerates too slow this means, for
example, that the car is fully loaded and the membership functions
in the controller should be adapted to this situation.

4.2. Adaptation of the position of the membership functions

Another method to tune an FC or a fuzzy decision system is by
the fuzzy sets
repositioning the membership functions of
corresponding to the linguistic terms of the fuzzy controller.
Usually this is done in combination with a data clustering method.
In a high dimensional system the data points are normally not
evenly distributed over the whole data space, but occur in groups.
If one uses a clustering algorithm to identify the data clusters then
one can position the membership functions of the fuzzy sets in
such a way that they correspond exactly to the data clusters. This
enables one to work with a minimal number of fuzzy sets whose
membership functions are well positioned to deal with the data.
Fig. 6 illustrates this information processing, where v1 and v2 are
the inputs, mk1 and mk2 are the membership functions of the input
linguistic terms, k ¼ 1; 5. Overviews on data-driven clustering
methods for adaptive fuzzy control are given in [198,199].

An example of this method is a fuzzy system for forecasting the
number of empty places in a number of parking garages downtown
[200]. The system has a large number of inputs like weather data,
time information and trafﬁc information as shown in Fig. 7. The

weather is supposed to inﬂuence the number of people that go
downtown for shopping or to visit the theatre, hence the three
weather inputs (temperature, rainfall and sunshine) inﬂuence the
number of cars downtown. Time information concerns the time of
the day, the day of the week, the season and special days like
holidays or large events. Together with the weather information
they will give a forecast of the number of cars that will go
downtown in the next hours. Trafﬁc information concerns the
trafﬁc density, and therefore the time people need to arrive at the
parking garage, and the time people need to enter the parking
garage, as many of them have narrow passages and long waiting
times when other people are manoeuvring through the garage.
When one considers data points over a longer period of time for
each parking garage separately, different patterns of data will lead
to a different positioning of the membership functions and
therefore to different fuzzy rule bases. In six different parking
garages in Du¨ sseldorf, Germany, the initial prediction quality of the
described system was around 80%. After repositioning and resizing
the membership functions of the fuzzy sets with a neural network,
the prediction quality changed as described in Table 1.

4.3. Adaptation of the rule base

A third adaptation method option is to change the rule weights
depending on the contribution of each rule to the performance of
the fuzzy control system. Each rule has a rule weight ri, usually
these ri’s are initially 1. If a control action was successful the rule
weights of the involved rules in this action are increased. If an
action was unsuccessful the weights of the involved rules are
decreased. Rules that after some time have rule weight 0 are not
involved anymore and will be removed.

This is an easy and straightforward method. Of course the
quality of this method highly depends on the performance
measure and the selection of the training data. One should always
check which rules were removed, in some cases these rules
concern exception cases and should be reintroduced by hand. This
method is used in identifying and controlling a large paper mill
[201], and in trafﬁc modelling and control [202].

4.4. Adaptation of the link values

A fourth adaptation method is to change the link values. This is
derived from neural networks and is actually not natural for fuzzy
systems. It means the following. Consider a rule base with two
inputs X1 and X2 and one output Y, and three fuzzy sets P, Z, and N,
on each input domain. One can translate the fuzzy system to a
neural network as described in Fig. 8. If one takes, for example, the
ﬁfth node in the Inference column, this corresponds to the rule ‘‘if
X1 is N and X2 is P then Y is Z’’. According to [203,204], the
logarithms and exponentials are needed in this scheme to cope
with several neural network properties.

Now one can feed the neural network with input and output
data pairs and train the network. Consider, for example, the rule ‘‘if
X1 is Z and X2 is P then Y is P’’, corresponding to the lowest node in
the Inference column of Fig. 8. After training the network this may
have become ‘‘if (0.5 X1 is Z) and (0.3 X2 is P) then (0.8 Y is P)’’,
because the neural network has adapted the link values. This rule is
hard to interpret but will probably describe the situation exactly.
This method is, for example, used in a system with many
sensors in a car that had to diagnose the kind of road and trafﬁc
conditions the car was driving in [204]. There was an initial rule
base describing the logical relation between the sensors and the
driving situation. Test data were generated by driving the car with
a video camera several days in all kinds of situations. The test data
were categorized to several driving situations. After translating the
rule base to a neural network all rule weights, the positions of the
membership functions and the link weights were adapted which
resulted in a much improved fuzzy rule base. The customer
demanded a rule base that could be checked by hand afterwards

instead of a black box neural network. The combination of a neural
network learning system and a readable fuzzy rule base is perfect
for automotive industry.

The neuro-fuzzy control systems can identify fuzzy control
rules and tune membership functions of the fuzzy controller
making use of the learning algorithms speciﬁc to neural networks
due to the well accepted functional equivalence between certain
classes of fuzzy systems and certain architectures of neural
networks [161]. Neuro-fuzzy control is in fact fuzzy control that
ensures enhanced control system performance due to the learning
capabilities and parallel processing brought by the neural net-
works. ANFIS [205] is the most popular approach with this regard.
Industrial applications of adaptive fuzzy control can be found in
batch processes [206–210], robotics [58,137,211–213], aircrafts
[214–217] or servo systems and electrical drives [218–221]. An
attractive application concerning the development of an intelligent
distributed and supervised control system for high-volume
production systems is suggested in [222]. A neural-fuzzy-based
force model for controlling band sawing process in the framework
of an intelligent adaptive control and monitoring system is given in
[223]. An adaptive control solution for a ventilating and air-
conditioning (HVAC) system is proposed in [224].

Topics of interest in adaptive fuzzy control include robust
adaptive control, the combination with sliding mode control and
the inclusion of derivative-free optimization techniques to
minimize the objective function that speciﬁes the performance
measure of the FCS. The derivative-free optimization techniques
are needed in industrial applications due to the complicated
expression of the objective function with several possible local
minima and to the speciﬁc constraints associated to the
optimization problem. Several fuzzy rule interpolation techniques
can be used in real-time applications which have sparse or
incomplete rule bases [225–227].

4.5. Fuzzy model-based predictive control

One illustrative industrial application of fuzzy model-based
predictive control is presented in [228]. A predictive controller is
suggested to modify the parameters of a T-S FC using the prediction
of the future process output. Use is made of the fact that if you have
a fuzzy model, you can test assumed future situations by putting
data into the model. It is possible to compare the outcomes of
different control inputs and take the best to proceed with. The
results presented in [228] involve a fuzzy model of a chemical
plant under the form of the following six fuzzy rules:

R j : IF CAðkÞ IS A j THEN CAðk þ 1Þ

¼  a1 jCAðkÞ   a2 jCAðk   1Þ þ b1 jqcðk   TDmÞ þ r j; j ¼ 1; 6;

(17)

where CA is the measured product concentration and T Dm is the
temperature. It is possible to rewrite these under the classical form
xmðk þ 1Þ ¼ ¯AmxmðkÞ þ ¯Bmuðk   T DmÞ þ ¯Rm;
ymðkÞ ¼ ¯CmxmðkÞ:

(18)

The system output is calculated as follows for H steps ahead:

and it compares the output with the output of a reference model. It
then calculates which parameters force the output to reach the
reference trajectory in the best way and uses these parameters in
the next control step. Other industrial applications of fuzzy model-
based predictive control are reported in [229–236].

5. Conclusions

Acknowledgements

The paper addresses a brief survey on industrial applications of
fuzzy control. The following classiﬁcation of the control systems
has been proposed with this regard:

- control systems with Mamdani fuzzy controllers,
- control systems with Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy controllers,
- adaptive and predictive control systems.

Although the literature makes a distinction between model-
based and model-free fuzzy control, the model-based design of
fuzzy control outlined in [237] is needed. The authors’ opinion is
that all fuzzy control applications should be tackled in the model-
based design manner. This is the way that enables systematic
analyses of the structural properties of the FCSs such as stability,
controllability, parametric sensitivity and robustness. Further-
more, this is the only solution to guarantee the desired/imposed
control system performance indices in several operating regimes,
and it represents one of the perspectives of fuzzy control.

A lot of industrial applications of fuzzy control are known and
reported today. This paper has highlighted just part of them. It
contains both mathematics and concrete applications thus
emphasizing the concrete connection between the industrial
applications of fuzzy control and the necessity of understanding
the basics of operating principle and mathematical characteriza-
tions of fuzzy controllers. The presentation of rather real-time
experiments instead of digital simulation results is another
perspective of fuzzy control. In this context the popularity of
fuzzy control will increase only if future applications will exhibit
signiﬁcantly better performance compared to the non-fuzzy ones.
There are several challenges which deserve more study when
fuzzy control is regarded from the point of view of its applicability:

- the design of rather general fuzzy controllers for well deﬁned
classes of systems instead of the particular controllers dedicated
to certain narrow applications,

- the use of iterative tuning and learning techniques that start with
initial fuzzy control systems and ensure next the performance
enhancement making use of the variables measured from those
closed-loop systems during their real-time operation [32,91],

- the identiﬁcation of Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy models with trade-off
to transparency, approximation accuracy and controller design
possibility,

- the connection between the parameter settings and tuning of the
fuzzy controller, and the imposed control system performance in
terms of performance indices like overshoot and settling time,
- the alleviation of the conservatism and sufﬁcient conditions-like
character in the stable design of fuzzy control systems in case of
Lyapunov’s approach in connection with LMIs,

- the need for low-cost fuzzy controllers from the points of view of
design in tuning transparency as well as implementation costs,
- the need for smooth control signals to be elaborated by all fuzzy

controllers,

- the use of the additional parameterization offered by type-2
fuzzy logic in handling the uncertainties speciﬁc to industrial
processes [238–244].

These challenges will attract the researchers and practitioners.
The immediate results will be reﬂected in more industrial
applications of fuzzy control illustrated in conference and journal
publications. The 244 reference positions cited here present a
sample of the results reported in the literature, and they can be
viewed as a guarantee that future successful applications will be
constructed.

IEEE, a member of

Hans Hellendoorn was born in 1964. He studied
computer science at the Delft University of Technology
(TU Delft). Next, he did Ph.D.-research in Delft and at
the National Aerospace Laboratory in Amsterdam
resulting, in 1990, in a Ph.D. thesis ‘‘Reasoning with
Fuzzy Logic’’. From 1990 to 1997, he worked as
department head in a research group on fuzzy control
at Siemens R&D in Munich, Germany, with many
practical applications, from power plants to cars and
from chips to telecommunication networks. From 1997
to 2000, he was department head for training simula-
tion at Siemens in the Netherlands. From 2001 to 2009,
he was responsible for innovation management. In 1999 he was appointed as a Part
Time Professor for Control Theory at the Faculty for Electrical Engineering. Since
2004, he is a Professor at the Delft Center for Systems and Control (DCSC), TU Delft.
He is the co-author of three scientiﬁc books and the author and co-author of more
than 140 scientiﬁc publications on computational intelligence and control. He has
supervised more than 60 M.Sc. students and 15 Ph.D. students in Germany, The
Netherlands and France. His research interests include multi-agent control of large-
scale hybrid systems, such as urban or national trafﬁc networks, electricity
networks, water networks and logistic networks, road trafﬁc control, such as trafﬁc
light control, intelligent speed systems and dynamic trafﬁc management, and
control and monitoring of harbor cranes. Prof. Hellendoorn was the president of the
European Chapter of the International Fuzzy Systems Association (IFSA) and the
coordinator of the Working Group on Fuzzy Sets (EUROFUSE) of the Association of
European Operational Research Societies (EURO). He is a member of the board of
many scientiﬁc and social foundations.
