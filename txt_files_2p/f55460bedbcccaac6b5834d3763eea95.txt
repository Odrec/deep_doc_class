List of current heads of state and government
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

This is a list of current heads of state and government, showing heads of state and heads of government where different,
mainly in parliamentary systems. Often a leader is both in presidential systems. Some states have semi-presidential systems,
where the head of government role (i.e. executive branch) is fulfilled by both the listed head of government and head of
state.

The list includes the names of recently elected or appointed heads who will take office on an appointed date.
