ISA-Principles

Topics for Presentations 
Topic

(embedded vs. high performance)

2

Modern Pipelining Principles

(high performance)

3

Sophisticated Cache Principles

(high performance)

Topics of Interest 

emphasis on specific requirements and 
differences of processor classes 
(Desktop/server versus embedded systems), 
reasons for differences (from applicational
point of view)
 design and architectural consequences 
examples (Pentium P4,) IA64 Itanium/core i7 
versus ARM  
implementation at micro-architecture level in 
more detail, examples, e.g. Intel Pentium 5 / 
Itanium/core i7 vs. ARM, may be also MIPS 
R4000 (App. A page 37++),
- performance / problems  limitations of 
ILP, e.g., exception/interrupt-handling, multi-
cycle execution 
In single and multi-processor/core systems 
- advanced cache optimization 
- example(s), e.g. Itanium/core i7/Xeon vs. 
ARM
- may be differences in multi-processors vs. 
multi-core systems
