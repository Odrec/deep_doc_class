Word segmentation problem

• How many words can you find here?

What‘s available

(1) Acoustic/visual features, phonemes, syllables

(2) Lexical Representation

(3) Context-based expectations (semantic, syntactic, pragmatic…)

Naive learners have only access to (1)

Possible word segmentation mechanisms: Statistics

• Statistics: Transitional probablities indicate word boundaries: pre ty ba by

TP= P (Y|X)=Frequency (XY) / Frequency (X)

• Classic study: Saffran, Newport & Aslin 1996

100 .33

Possible word segmentation mechanisms: Statistics

• Statistical mechanisms – analysis of distributional and contingency

information in the sound stream
– Problem: Which statistics to use? Danger of computational explosion

Possible word segmentation mechanisms: Acoustic cues

• Acoustic cues, e.g. word stress, intonational cues to phrasal boundaries

• How do infants know their language specific stress pattern?

•

•

Jusczyk, Houston & Newsome (1999):
7 ½ month olds use trochaic stress to segment words
KINGdom easier than guiTAR
At the age of 10 ½ month weak-strong words are segmented

Possible word segmentation mechanisms: Acoustic cues

• How do infants which stress patterns indicate word

boundaries?
– innate trochaic bias
– experience from single words
– initial use of different segmentation mechanism

(e.g. statistics)

Possible word segmentation mechanisms: Acoustic cues

• Thiessen & Saffran (2003): Statistical cues override stress cues at the age of

6-7 months while stress cues override statistical ones at 9 months

Iambic:     diTI#buGO#daPU#doBI…

Trochaic: DIti#BUgo#DApu#DObi…

9 month-olds (familiarity preference)

7 month-olds (novelty preference)

Possible word segmentation mechanisms: Other cues

• Allophonic cues (e.g. nitrates vs. night rates, Jusczyk, Hohne & Bauman, 

1999) 

• Familiar lexical items (e.g. occurrence babies own name leads to

segmentation of subsequent word, Bortfeld et al. 2005)

• Phonotactic cues (e.g. consonant clusters that typically occur within or

between words

Many open questions

• When do infants start to use statistical information to segment words?

• When and how do they recognize words that they heard before?

• What are the neural processes supporting these very first stages of word

learning?
