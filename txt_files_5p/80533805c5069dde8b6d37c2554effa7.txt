The yiaQRS genes of Escherichia coli K-12 are involved
in carbohydrate metabolism. Clustering of homologous
genes was found throughout several unrelated bacteria.
Strikingly, all four bacterial transport protein classes
were found, conserving transport function but not mech-
anism. It appears that during evolution the ability to
transport, phosphorylate and metabolize substrates of
unknown identity have been conserved. However, the
transporter classes have been swapped. This probably
demonstrates the subtlety of transport-protein evolution.

The gene cluster designated yiaJKLMNOPQRS (GenBank
accession number g1789999 – 1790008) in the Escherichia
coli K-12 genome (Figure 1a) has been suggested to be
involved in the uptake and metabolism of carbohydrates
[1–5]. Recently, we have demonstrated that the bind-
ing protein-dependent secondary transporter (Figure 2a)
encoded by the yiaMNO genes transports the rare pentose
L-xylulose, providing the ﬁrst evidence that these systems
are able to transport carbohydrates [6]. During character-
ization of this transporter we became interested in the
function of the remaining genes in the cluster. An increase
in the availability of genome databases has permitted a
search for similar gene clusters among other organisms.
Homologs of the individual yiaQ, yiaR and yiaS genes
were discovered in several bacterial and archaeal genomes
(T.H. Plantinga et al., unpublished). Remarkably, cluster-
ing of these genes in putative operons occurs in a limited

Figure 2. Domain structure of the four major classes of bacterial uptake systems.
(a) Binding protein-dependent secondary transporters [11 –14]. The substrate-
binding protein delivers the substrate to the membrane-localized transporter, and
unidirectional transport is driven by the proton-motive force (pmf) and/or sodium-
motive force (smf). The carrier domains are dissimilar: the small domain contains
four putative transmembrane domains (TMDs) and shows no homology with
known membrane proteins, whereas the large domain resembles classical second-
ary transporters; it contains 12 putative TMDs and a large central cytosolic loop.
(b) Secondary transporters facilitate solute uptake in a pmf- and/or smf-dependent
manner [15]. A single integral membrane protein mediates reversible transport.
(c) Phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase systems (PTS) use
multiple cytosolic components, such as the IIA and IIB proteins, to transfer the
phosphoryl group from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to the carbohydrate substrate
that is taken up via the IIC membrane domain [10]. (d) Binding protein-dependent
primary transporters are members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter
superfamily [16]. The binding protein donates the solute to two identical or homo-
logous membrane-localized transport domains. Subsequently, transport is driven
by hydrolysis of ATP, which is mediated by two identical or homologous ATPases
that are associated with the carrier at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane.

number of bacterial genomes. The conserved genomic organ-
ization suggests that these genes specify similar functions.

Clustering of putative carbohydrate-metabolizing
enzymes
An extensive search of accessible genome databases has
revealed 30 gene clusters containing putative enzymes
that are highly similar to those encoded by the yiaQRS
genes, and in most cases the gene order is well conserved
(Figure 1). Interestingly, representatives are found in
several unrelated Gram-positive and -negative bacterial
species, most of which are known human pathogens
(Table 1). Clustering of these three enzymes is found in
26 completely sequenced bacterial genomes that are
available at this time, and also in the relatively small
genomes of three Mycoplasma species (Table 1). Although
homologs of the individual genes are found in the Archaea,
the cluster does not appear to be conserved in members of
this kingdom.

To date, only the E. coli K-12 enzymes have been
biochemically characterized in detail. YiaQ has been
suggested to function as a 3-keto-L-gulonate 6-phosphate
decarboxylase based on a comparison with its homolog
Yjf V [7]. Because of amino acid sequence homology,
YiaQ has also been suggested to function as a hexulose
6-phosphate synthase [5], but this activity has not been
demonstrated experimentally [8]. The YiaR amino acid
sequence shows a high similarity to 3-epimerases, and

has therefore been tentatively proposed to function as a
L-xylulose 5-phosphate 3-epimerase [4]. YiaS is a ribulose
5-phosphate 4-epimerase [4,7].

The yjf VWX genes of E. coli K-12 (Figure 1c) are
highly similar in sequence to the yiaQRS genes [5,7].
The Yjf V protein is 46% identical to YiaQ and, as
mentioned previously, has been shown to function as a
3-keto-L-gulonate 6-phosphate decarboxylase [7]. Yjf W
is a L-xylulose 5-phosphate 3-epimerase, and is 56%
identical to YiaR [7]. Finally, Yjf X is a ribulose 5-phosphate
4-epimerase, and 61% identical to YiaS [7]. The yjfQ–X
cluster of E. coli K-12 (Figure 1c) has recently been
shown to facilitate the uptake and subsequent metab-
olism of L-ascorbate [7,9].

Further detailed functional information concerning the
gene clusters discovered in our search is lacking at this
time, and the grounds for their strong conservation in a
range of potential human pathogens is unknown. This
intriguing question awaits further investigation.

Conservation of transport function
The potential roles that these enzyme clusters might have
in carbohydrate metabolism have been described [5], but a
striking feature of these systems has been overlooked up to
now. It appears that the clustering of the genes encoding
these enzymes coincides with the presence of a transport
system (Figure 1), the class of which varies (Table 1;
Figure 1). A representative from each of the four classes of
prokaryotic solute-uptake systems that are known to date
(Figure 2) can be found, and corresponding gene clusters
are described here.

The most widespread cluster contains a PTS (phospho-
enolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system)
[5,10] (Figure 1c: ‘yjfSTU’; Figure 2c) and is found in 20
of the 30 gene clusters discovered in our search. This
cluster is also the predominant one found in Gram-positive
bacteria (Table 1). These systems use multiple cytosolic
proteins, such as the IIA and IIB components, to transfer
the phosphoryl group from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)
to the substrate that is taken up via the permease IIC
component (Figure 1c and 2c) [10]. These systems are only
found in bacteria and mainly take up carbohydrates [10],
although the YjfSTU system of E. coli was shown to
transport L-ascorbate [5].

The yiaJ–S cluster of E. coli K-12 contains a binding
protein-dependent secondary transporter [11,12], or a tri-
partite ATP-independent periplasmic (TRAP) transporter
[13,14] (Figure 1a: ‘yiaMNO’; Figure 2a). In these types of
transporters, the unidirectional uptake of solutes depends
on the solute-binding protein, which delivers the substrate
from the extracellular side to the two membrane-localized
permease domains (Figure 2a). Transport is driven by the
proton- or sodium-motive force (pmf or smf, respectively).
The membrane proteins are dissimilar; the small perme-
ase component contains four putative transmembrane
domains (TMDs) and shows no homology with known
transport proteins. The large domain resembles the
classical secondary transporters, containing 12 putative
TMDs and a large central cytosolic loop that separates
TMD 6 from TMD 7 [11–14]. Remarkably, an almost

identical cluster was found in Klebsiella oxytoca, but the
three genes encoding the YiaMNO transporter appear to
have been swapped for two different genes: one encoding a
secondary transporter (Figure 1b: ‘yiaX2’; Figure 2b), and
one gene of unknown function that is homologous to a
chemotaxis protein (Figure 1b:
‘yiaX1’). Secondary
transporters facilitate solute uptake in a pmf- or smf-
dependent manner [15]. Transport is reversible and is
mediated by a single integral membrane protein that
generally consists of 12 TMDs, with a large cytoplasmic
loop between TMD 6 and TMD 7 [15] (Figure 2b).

Finally, a binding protein-dependent ATP-binding
cassette (ABC) transporter (Figure 2d) has been found
[16]. In Yersinia pestis, a yiaR and a yiaS homolog have
been found in a gene cluster with such a transport system
(Figure 1d: ‘YPO3328–3332’). In these transporters, the
solute-binding protein donates the solute to two identical
or homologous membrane-localized transport domains.
Uptake is driven by hydrolysis of ATP, and is mediated by
two identical or homologous ATPases that are associated
with the carrier on the cytosolic side of the membrane [16]
(Figure 2d). The Yersinia cluster also contains a kinase
that is homologous to yiaP, and a DeoR-like regulator
(Figure 1d: ‘yjfQ’) that is homologous to the one located
upstream of the YjfSTU PTS in E. coli K-12 [9,17].
Although the gene order at this locus is not conserved,
this localization suggests that these genes might have
similar functions.

Conservation of phosphorylation function
Notably, the capacity of these gene clusters to phosphory-
late the transported substrate has been conserved in all
cases. The widespread PTS phosphorylates its carbo-
hydrate substrate during transport [10] (Figure 2c). A
kinase that is able to phosphorylate the substrate is
located next to the three other types of transporters
(Figure 1). For example, the YiaMNO transporter of E. coli
K-12 transports L-xylulose [6], whereas, the yiaP gene
encodes a L-xylulose kinase [1]. It is therefore probable
that these systems are involved in the uptake and
metabolism of a carbohydrate.

Conclusion
Taken together, 26 of those bacterial genomes that are
available contain a highly similar yiaQRS gene cluster
that probably speciﬁes functions in carbohydrate meta-
bolism. The gene order and the ability to phosphorylate
the substrate is remarkably conserved, indicating that
strong selection pressures are keeping these gene clusters
together [18]. This suggests that the gene products play a
crucial role in survival of the cell, and therefore might be
involved in cellular processes other than carbon-source
uptake and metabolism [18]. Strikingly, these clusters
always contain a member from one of the four major classes
of prokaryotic solute-uptake systems, which appear to
have been swapped between gene clusters. It is known that
transporters with different mechanisms of action can feed
into the same metabolic pathways, and that many sugars
are taken up by more than one transporter of different
types. This has been interpreted as being a reﬂection of the
physiological conditions. Here, we show for the ﬁrst

time a case in which different transport mechanisms
are genetically linked to a conserved carbohydrate
metabolic cluster. Even transporters of the unusual
class of binding protein-dependent secondary transpor-
ters were found linked to this cluster. It was suggested
that the different classes of transporters have evolved
from secondary transporters by association with bind-
ing proteins, ATPases and phosphorylating enzymes,
thereby gaining higher substrate afﬁnities and trans-
location power [12]. It is possible that in this cluster
we can see the subtlety by which evolution can take
place at the genome level.

The report in 2002 of a novel archaeal species, the ﬁrst
representative of an unknown phylum, reminded us of
the tremendous microbial diversity that remains to be
discovered on this planet [1]. Nanoarchaeum equitans (the
tiny archaea that rides the ﬁre ball) is a small spherical cell
that grows attached to the surface of its archaeal host,
Igniococcus spp. These organisms were isolated from a hot
submarine vent in the Kolbeinsey ridge, north of Iceland,
and can be grown in the laboratory in anaerobic cultures at
90 8C in the presence of S, H2 and CO2. It was by micro-
scopic examination of the Igniococcus cells that their
‘rider’, N. equitans, was discovered and by which it was
subsequently demonstrated that N. equitans is an obligate
symbiont of Igniococcusspp. that cannot be grown alone in
culture. Equally surprising was that ‘universal’ primers
designed to amplify ssRNA genes from bacterial and

archaeal species failed to yield a product from N. equitans
by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Subsequent
comparison of the ssRNA gene sequence from N. equitans
with those of other archeal species identiﬁed it as the ﬁrst
member of a novel phylum, the Nanoarchaeota, which
represents the most deeply branching archaeal lineage
to date. Estimation of genome size by pulse ﬁeld gel
electrophoresis suggested that N. equitans represents a
minimal organism with a genome of ,500 kb.

The much anticipated genomic sequence of N. equitans
was published recently [2]. Its genome size of 490 885 bp
makes this the smallest prokaryotic genome deciphered to
date. Despite its small genome size, this archaeon has one
of the highest gene densities reported to date, with ,95%
of the genome representing predicted coding sequences
and stable RNAs. Most of the genes involved in infor-
mation processing (DNA replication, transcription and
translation) show most similarity to their counterparts in
