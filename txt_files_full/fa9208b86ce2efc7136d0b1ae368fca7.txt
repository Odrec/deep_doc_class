Introduction to  
English Language Teaching 

Session 3 – Language Acquisition 

Today… 

 Acquisition vs. Learning 

 Theories of L1 acquisition 

 Implications for ELT 

Session 3 – Language Acquisition: 
Reading Assignment: 
 
 How do children learn their mother 

tongue? 

 Can this process (of first language 

acquisition) be replicated in the foreign 
language classroom?

Language acquisition or 
language learning?  

  Language acquisition: development 
of language proficiency in an informal, 
natural, uncontrolled setting 

 

 

 

Language learning: development 
of language proficiency in an 
institutional, controlled context

Acquisition vs. Learning 

Acquisition 

Learning 

implicit, subconscious 

explicit, conscious 

informal situations 

formal situations 

develop grammatical ‘feel’  study grammatical rules 

stable order of acquisition 

simple to complex order of 
learning 

5 

Behaviourist view 

 Skinner (1957) Verbal Behaviour 

 learning = change of behaviour 

 stimulus – response  

 imitation and repetition lead to habit forming, 

supported by reinforcement (negative and 
positive feedback) 

→ audiolingualism 

→ pattern drills 

→ practice/excercises 

 

6 

Behaviourist view - shortcomings 

 creative language use? 

 stable order of acquisition? 

 socio-cultural competence? 

 other factors like aptitude, motivation, 

age? 

 

 

7 

Innatist/nativist view 

 

 Noam Chomsky 

 children are born with an innate capacity to learn 

languages → Language Acquisition Device (LAD) 

 input activates the LAD and triggers LA 

 based on Universal Grammar (characteristics 

universal to all languages, like singular and plural) 

→ contrasting L1 and L2 

→ focus on competence and system learning 

→ Lenneberg (1976): critical period (only L1) 

 

8 

Innatist/nativist view: shortcomings 

 bi-/multilingual children? 

 aptitude, motivation?  

 discourse/socio-cultural competence? 

 sociocultural environment? 

 

9 

Interactionist view 

 Piaget, Vygotsky  

 interaction between learner and his/her environment 

 language = negotiation of meaning 

 “caretakerese” 

 zone of proximal development 

 

→ communicative turn in FLT 

→ focus on the social function of language 

 

 

 

Language acquisition in the foreign 
language classroom (?) 

 Which principles/methods are thought to help 
foreign language learning resemble language 
acquisition? → Keywords! 
(cf. Harmer 2007) 

 Work in groups of four. Divide the text as 

follows: A1+A3; A4, B-C, D-F 10 min. 

 Compare your results in expert group 15 min. 
 Report back to your initial group 25 min. 

 

 

 

Language acquisition in the foreign 
language classroom (?) 

 Which principles/methods are thought to 
help foreign language learning resemble 
language acquisition?  

Extra: 
 Which of them seem to be particularly 

relevant for your school form? 

 

 

 

25 Min. 

Results (keywords) 

 Comprehensible input (i+1) 

 Meaningful settings 

 Task-based teaching 

 Focus on form vs focus on forms 

 Noticing 

 Repetition and cognitive depth 

 Discovery learning 

 Lowering the affective filter 

 Scaffolding 

 Language play

Summary: Language Acquisition 

 no single theory can explain everything 

 evidence explains single parts of the aquisition 

process, but not all of it 

 conclusions can be drawn for foreign language 

learning 

 many principles of ELT have been influenced by 

“trends“ in LA theory 

 acquisition  

 

 

learning

Next Week 

 Individual differences in language 

learning: 
 Read M.H./S.v.D: 33-38  
 Read  the 3 very short texts on Stud.IP (cf. 

syllabus!), compare to M.H./S.v.D. 

 Bring texts Learning Style Quiz (also on 

Stud.IP)
