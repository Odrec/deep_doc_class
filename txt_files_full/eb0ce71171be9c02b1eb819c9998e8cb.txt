ABSTRACT. Biomass content and turnover rate were estimated for a lowland wet
rain forest in French Guiana. A regression model relating the biomass of a tree to
its dbh (diameter at breast height) was deduced from previously published data. A
power-law allometric relationship of the form AGTB = aDb was used to estimate the
tree biomass, AGTB (Mg ha–1), from its dbh D (cm). Using direct measurements of
tree biomass in the literature, the best-ﬁt allometric exponent b = 2.42 (SD = 0.02)
was found. The logarithm of the coefﬁcient a was normally distributed with an aver-
age of - 2.00 (SD = 0.27). This method was applied to two permanent research sta-
tions of the lowland tropical rain forest of French Guiana: the Nouragues and Piste
de Saint-Elie. At the Nouragues, the biomass was estimated from trees 10 cm in dia-
meter on two plots covering a total surface area of 22 ha and yielded an average bio-
mass of 309 Mg ha- 1 (– 32 Mg ha- 1, 95% conﬁdence interval). Spatial variability was
also addressed at the Nouragues by estimating the biomass of trees M 30 cm dbh over
a total surface area of 82 ha. For the wet tropical forest vegetation type, an average
of 284 Mg ha- 1 was obtained (spatial variability – 55 Mg ha- 1). Biomass turnover was
evaluated at Piste de Saint-Elie from two transects (0.78 and 1 ha) on which all trees
M 5 cm in diameter were recorded and mapped twice in 10 y. Transect 1 showed a
slight increase in biomass, from 245 to 260 Mg ha- 1 (338 to 345 Mg ha- 1 for transect
2), corresponding to a net increase of 1.9 Mg ha- 1 y- 1 (0.7 Mg ha- 1 y- 1), and the bio-
mass ingrowth was 3.2 Mg ha- 1 y- 1 (2.8 Mg ha- 1 y- 1). These ﬁgures are discussed in
the light of the natural recruitment dynamics of tropical forests.

INTRODUCTION

Biomass is an important parameter for characterizing a forest ecosystem. The
efﬁciency of carbon storage in organic matter reﬂects the quality of environ-
mental conditions: climate, soil structure and nutrient availability. A precise

knowledge of the biomass is crucial for harvesting assessments (Vanclay 1995)
and, at a much larger scale, for the study of greenhouse warming scenarios
(Houghton et al. 2000, Shukla et al. 1990). Atmospheric carbon uptake by the
vegetation is believed to play a major role in the global climate changes of the
century to come (Fan et al. 1998, Phillips et al. 1998). An estimated 37% (428
Pg = 428.1015 g) of the world’s living terrestrial carbon pool (1146 Pg) is stored
in tropical forests (Dixon et al. 1994), more than half of which is in the neo-
tropics (53%).

Although the need is great, little is known about inter-site and temporal
variability of forest biomass in tropical zones, compared to the large amount
of information available in temperate regions (see Brown 1997 for a recent
review). Previous studies on biomass estimates for tropical forests range
between 148 and 669 Mg ha- 1 (1 Mg ha- 1 = 106 g ha- 1), the latter from Kira
(1971). Direct assessment of the aboveground biomass is strenuous; all trees
must be felled and weighed in a small sample area, in order to parameterize
a regression method. Moreover, direct biomass estimates are generally based
upon small sample units, typically less than 100 trees M 10 cm dbh, that is,
less than 1/5 ha. Large trees (M 70 cm dbh) have an overwhelming weight in
the average biomass content of a forest and they may be under or over-
represented in small sampling units. Therefore, even direct biomass estimates
should be interpreted with caution. In the absence of any such data, the use of
functional relationships between surrogate variables, such as the dbh, and the
biomass, is the most natural way to proceed, provided the error on such estim-
ates is systematically investigated (I. F. Brown et al. 1995).

In the present paper, we propose an estimation method for the biomass of a
lowland tropical rainforest in French Guiana. We give a new argument based
on theoretical considerations, to justify the power-law allometric relationship
between biomass and dbh. A careful analysis of previously published data on
tree biomass in similar forest types provides an estimation of the error on the
coefﬁcients of the regression model. This method is then applied to two per-
manent plots in French Guiana: the Nouragues Research Station (100 km
inland) and the Piste de Saint-Elie Research Station (coastal rain forest).
Finally, we discuss the reliability of our estimates, and the inﬂuence of soil on
the spatial variation of the biomass.

STUDY AREA

French Guiana

French Guiana, an overseas French territory, lies between 2(cid:176) 10¢ and 5(cid:176) 45¢ N
and 51(cid:176) 40¢ and 54(cid:176) 30¢ W in northeastern South America. Of the region, 97% is
covered by lowland wet tropical forest (Figure 1). A phytogeographic descrip-
tion of the region is found in Lindeman & Moolenaar (1959) and Lindeman &
Mori (1989). Annual rainfall is between 1650 and 4000 mm- 1, with a decreasing
gradient from the coastal area to the southern tip of the country. A pronounced

America. The grey regions along the coast give the locations of the coastal savannas. The rest of the country
is covered by the tropical rain forest (lines show the river courses).

dry season of 2 mo is recorded from September to November and a short dry
season in March, both related to the displacement of the inter-tropical conver-
gence zone (ITCZ).

The average temperature is 25.8 (cid:176) C with an annual amplitude of 2 (cid:176) C and

82

daily amplitudes of 7 (cid:176) C in the rainy season (10 (cid:176) C during the dry season).
Geology is typical of the Guiana Shield with a central pediplain and sparse
rugged mountains of Precambrian metamorphic and granitic rocks. The alti-
tude is less than 500 m above sea level.

The Nouragues

The Nouragues Research Station is located 10 km north of the Arataye river,
4(cid:176) 50¢ N and 52(cid:176) 42¢ W (Poncy et al. 1998). This research station was created in
1987, near to a granite hill (inselberg). Annual rainfall is 2757 mm y- 1 (from
1989 to 1998) with around 70 mm mo–1 in September and November and more
than 300 mm mo- 1 in January and from April to June. Rock savanna is found
on the inselberg (Larpin 1993), while the surrounding forest is a typical lowland
wet tropical rain forest (Poncy et al. 1998).

The permanent plot extends over 82 ha of undisturbed old-growth forest,
separated into two geologically different areas (Figure 2). Analysis of the spa-
tial patterns of ground-level light intensity has been discussed by L. Cournac
and coworkers (unpubl. data). A ﬁrst plot of 70 ha (‘grand plateau’, hereafter

Figure 2. The permanent plots of the Nouragues. Elevation lines are drawn at 20 m intervals (maximal
elevation: 411 m at the top of the inselberg). A large sampling plot (70 ha), called ‘grand plateau’ (GP) has
been established east of the Nouragues river, and a smaller plot was located west of the river (‘petit plateau’
or PP, 12 ha in size).

referred to as GP) is on metamorphic bed-rock of the Paramaca series, covered
with clayey soil. A second plot of size 12 ha (‘petit plateau’, or PP) is on granitic
and crystalline bed-rocks covered with sandy clayey soil.

GP has all trees M 30 cm dbh tagged, mapped, measured and identiﬁed.
This information was also recorded in one strip of 1000-m · 100-m (10 ha) for
all trees M 10 cm dbh. PP has all 6441 trees M 10 cm dbh mapped, measured
and identiﬁed. Buttressed trees were measured 50 cm above buttresses follow-
ing the standard procedure discussed in Sheil (1995) and Condit (1998). The
frequency distributions are given for both plots in Table 1.

The southernmost part of GP is largely dominated by lianas, which results
in a dense layer of vegetation, and a low density of tree stems. This liana forest
is considered as being a different forest type, and therefore we did not include
it in our biomass estimate of the wet rain forest.

The ﬂoristic inventory is very rich, with over 1200 species of angiosperms,
dominated by Orchidaceae, Mimosaceae and Rubiaceae (AUBLET database
for the Nouragues area; Poncy et al. 1998). Over 145 tree species were identiﬁed
in the permanent plots. Concerning trees above 30 cm dbh, the dominant
families are Caesalpiniaceae (20.1%), Lecythidaceae (12.9%), Mimosaceae
(10.1%) and Sapotaceae (9.25%). The diversity index (number of species per
ha for trees M 10 cm dbh) ranges between 160 and 260 species ha- 1.

Piste de Saint-Elie

The research station of Piste de Saint-Elie (5(cid:176) 30¢ N, 53(cid:176) 00¢ W) is located 16
km south of Sinnamary and has been much studied since 1976 (Lescure et al.
1983, Lescure & Boulet 1985, Pe´lissier & Rie´ra 1993, Puig et al. 1990, Roggy et
al. 1999). Annual rainfall is slightly above 3000 mm y- 1. The monthly rainfall
pattern is more variable than in the Nouragues. The forest mostly grows on a
mantle of schist covered by a sandy clayey soil (Lescure & Boulet 1985). The
ﬂoristic composition differs slightly from that at the Nouragues, the dominant
families being Lecythidaceae (28%), Caesalpiniaceae (22%) and Chrysobalana-
ceae (12%), for trees M 20 cm dbh (Pe´lissier & Rie´ra 1993). The diversity index
is between 160 and 180 species ha- 1.

for the two plots where all trees M 10 cm dbh were measured (a 10-ha strip in the ‘grand plateau’ GP, and
the 12-ha ‘petit plateau’ PP, see Figure 2). The third line gives the frequency distribution for all 9892 trees
M 30 cm dbh recorded over the entire 82-ha plot (PP+GP).

The plots analysed in the course of the present investigation are the same
as those described in Pe´lissier & Rie´ra (1993). All trees M 5 cm dbh were
tagged, mapped, measured and identiﬁed to the species both in 1981 and 1991
(Pe´lissier & Rie´ra 1993). Transect 1 is a strip of 20-m · 360-m (0.78 ha) with
919 trees in 1981, and 916 in 1991. Transect 2 has a size of 20-m · 500-m
(1 ha) and had 1168 trees in 1981 (1160 in 1991).

METHODS

Allometric relationship between biomass and dbh

In almost all studies, both in temperate (Bunce 1968, Rapp et al. 1999, Whit-
taker & Woodwell 1968) and in tropical areas (Arau´jo et al. 1999, Brown 1997,
Edwards & Grubb 1977, Laurance et al. 1997, Lescure et al. 1983, Overman et
al. 1994, Ovington & Olson 1970), a strong correlation was found between
AGTB, the aboveground dry biomass of a tree (organic matter content) and
its dbh D with a linear regression coefﬁcient greater than r2 = 0.97. The best-ﬁt
regression including only the dbh is

1n(AGTB) = a + b1n(D)

(1)
AGTB is measured in kg and D is in cm. For the sake of simplicity we use the
notation a = ln(a) throughout this paper. We also distinguish between the
biomass for one tree (AGTB) and the tree aboveground biomass of a sampled
area (B). The coefﬁcients a and b given in the literature are presented in Table
2 (for a related discussion, see Alves et al. 1997, Arau´jo et al. 1999, Overman et
al. 1994). In most cases, the tree height H is not a good estimator of the
aboveground biomass. This observation should not be surprising in view of the
high variability of tree architectures in the tropical zone (Halle´ et al. 1978). For
monopodial architectures and accurate height estimates, the best estimator for
AGTB is D2 H, as expected from a simple scaling argument. In contrast, for
tropical forests, the height of the largest trees is often estimated within a range
of 5–10 m. Moreover, the use of a three-parameter regression, including the
height, leads almost systematically to a higher correlation coefﬁcient r than
the two-parameter regression (Eqn 1), even if the additional variable H is
poorly measured. Therefore, we follow previous discussions (Lescure et al. 1983,
Overman et al. 1994) and we retain D only.

Measurements in temperate forests (Bunce 1968, Rapp et al. 1999) and in
tropical forests (see below and Table 2) suggest that the power-law regression
(4) is consistent with physiological constraints imposed to trees. A recent study
by West et al. (1997) (see also Enquist et al. 1998) on the metabolic rates of
living organisms shows that tree-like structures of the respiratory and blood
vessels networks implies that the metabolic rate should scale as AGTB3/4. This
relationship, referred to as Kleiber’s law was shown to ﬁt experimental results
over a 26-fold range in the logarithm of the biomass (from one mammalian
cell to an elephant). The allometric relationship between the variables of the

trees M 10 cm dbh were selected, except for study 1. Although these data were collected in very different
forests, a striking similarity is observed both for the exponent b and the constant a
(r is the linear correlation
coefﬁcient). Small trees strongly affect the allometric coefﬁcients, as evidenced in study site 1, where trees
were sampled from 1 cm dbh upwards.

model also relates the basal diameter D of the tree structure (aorta for the
blood system, trunk for a tree) to the biomass AGTB through AGTB p D8/3.
The reader is referred to Enquist et al. (1998) for further details on this theory.
The slight but systematic departure from the theoretical 8/3 exponent observed
in Table 2 may reﬂect other physiological constraints on trees.

Derivation of the allometric equation

We used published datasets providing the biomass AGTB and the dbh D of
felled and weighed trees, to obtain the best estimate of a
and b in Eqn (1).
These datasets are numbered 4 to 11 in Table 2 (most of them gathered in
Brown 1997), and they correspond to 378 trees M 10 cm dbh.

For all eleven datasets reported in Table 2 a best-ﬁt of the form of Eqn (1)
was available. These results and the corresponding estimates of a
and b are
reported in Table 2 for each separate study. Eqn (1) provides an excellent
linear correlation coefﬁcient in all cases, and the b exponent ranges from 2.32
to 2.72.

In Figure 3, the biomass of each tree from studies 4 to 11 was plotted against
its dbh. This represents 378 trees M 10 cm dbh overall, with 135 M 30 cm dbh,
and 32 large trees (M 70 cm dbh). No pattern seems to emerge if both quantit-
ies are plotted using linear axes (left panel of Figure 3). However, a log-log
plot (right panel) clearly shows that all the points are around a line with a
2.00 (r2 = 0.97), an
well-deﬁned slope, b = 2.42, and a best-ﬁt constant a = -
observation consistent with Eqn (1).

It was assumed that the variability in this best-ﬁt equation does not affect
the parameter b but only a
. This assumption is motivated by the observation
that 97% of the datapoints in Figure 3 fall in a strip of height 0.78 (dashed
lines in Figure 3). Tree-to-tree variability was estimated by computing a
for
each tree, from the formula a = ln(AGTB) - b ln(D). This random variable has

a mean - 2.00 and a unimodal distribution. Moreover, a c 2-test on the distribu-
tion shows that it is normally distributed (histogram with 19 classes, c 2 = 6.38,
P < 0.01). The standard deviation on a
0.27. Therefore, our best ﬁt
yields

is D

a =

1n(AGTB) = - 2.00 – 0.27 + 2.42 ln(D)

(2)
For example, the average estimated biomass for a tree of dbh 30 cm is AGTB =
508 kg, the lower bound is AGTBmin = 344 kg (- 32%) and the upper bound is
AGTBmax = 750 kg (+ 47%).

It should be emphasized that datasets 4–11 span a large range in tropical
rainforest types, from moist forests (rainfall less than 3000 mm y- 1 and more
than 1500 mm y- 1) to wet forests (rainfall more than 3000 mm y- 1). However,
Overman et al. (1994) have predicted very close estimates (a = -
0.235 and b = 2.48) on the basis of their dataset of 54 trees (terra ﬁrme forest
with 3000 mm y- 1 rainfall), which we have not included in the present
relationship.

Our approach contrasts with previous work (Brown 1997) which attempted
to ﬁnd a locally derived best-ﬁt equation in order to compute the biomass, and
which yielded very different allometric forms for different forest types. To test
the variability of the regression with forest types, we have selected trees M 10
cm dbh. A direct power-law ﬁt of the data yields: for wet plots (rainfall M 3000
wet = 0.33, (n = 146, r2 = 0.98) and, for moist
mm y- 1) bwet = 2.41, a wet = - 2.14 D
plots (rainfall < 3000 mm y- 1) bmoist = 2.54, a moist = - 2.19, D
moist = 0.37 (n = 105,
r2 = 0.98). Our choice (b = 2.42, a = -
0.27) results in an over-
estimation for the wet plots (ratio observed biomass over predicted biomass,
, is r = 0.8, SD = 0.25) and an under-estimation for the moist plots (r = 1.2,
SD = 0.51). For the purpose of the present study, the rainfall pattern around
3000 mm y- 1 in French Guiana justiﬁes our choice.

Error propagation

A simple method to propagate the errors from the tree-scale estimate to the
plot-scale estimate is presented. Throughout this study, we took sampling units
of 1 ha in area.

The biomass was estimated for Q different replicates of each 1-ha sampling
unit, by assuming that the error on the logarithm of the biomass estimate of
one tree, ln(AGTB) was normally distributed, with a variance D
, as discussed
above. Then, the tree biomasses are summed over all the trees yielding a bio-
mass estimate Bq for the replicate q e {1, . . . ,Q} of the sampling unit (1 ha).
The average estimated biomass and the SD are therefore B = (1/Q) S Q
q =1 Bq,
and (D B)2 = (1/Q)S Q
q =1(Bq - B)2. For the present study, we took Q = 1000 in all
cases. Assuming that the Bq are normally distributed, the 95% conﬁdence inter-
val on B is given by B – 1.96D B. In fact, the hypothesis of independence on the
Bq variables is not strictly valid and the actual distribution slightly departs from

a Gaussian (I. F. Brown et al. 1995). Nevertheless, the normal distribution
provides a reasonable estimate of the conﬁdence interval.

Small trees and belowground biomass

Trees less than 10 cm dbh contribute little to the total aboveground biomass.
Nevertheless, this leads to a systematic underestimate of B, about 2% of the
total biomass (Lescure et al. 1983).

The root biomass can be indirectly estimated using the ratio of root-to-shoot
(R/S) biomass found in the literature, e.g. 0.19 (Jackson et al. 1996) or 0.24,
SD = 0.14 (Cairns et al. 1997). The total soil organic matter (roots plus soil
carbon) represents almost half of the total carbon content in tropical evergreen
forests of South America (Dixon et al. 1994).

RESULTS

Biomass estimates at the Nouragues

To estimate the average biomass at the Nouragues research station, we used
the two subplots on which all trees were measured from 10 cm dbh and above
(the 10-ha strip in the GP, plus the 12-ha PP, see Study Area and Figure 2).
The biomasses corresponding to trees M 10, 30 and 70 cm dbh, were evaluated
and the errors were propagated. The statistical conﬁdence interval (at 95%)
was recorded, together with the maximal and the minimal values reached
during the pseudo-replication (Table 3).

For trees M 10 cm dbh, the average stem number N is slightly greater than
500, and the basal area around 32 m2 ha- 1. The average biomass is 301 Mg ha- 1
in the GP plot, and 317 Mg ha- 1 in the PP. The error due to biomass estimate
at the tree level yields an uncertainty of – 32 Mg ha- 1 (95% CI) so the two
subplots do not support a signiﬁcantly different amount of biomass.

The overall biomass estimates were found to be 301 – 32 Mg ha- 1 in the
10-ha strip of the GP, and 317 – 32 Mg ha- 1 in the 12-ha PP. This difference
is not statistically signiﬁcant (c 2-test, P > 0.05). However, the largest biomass

content for a 1-ha sampling unit was found to be 416 – 38 Mg ha- 1, while the
smallest biomass content was 230 – 21 Mg ha- 1, a signiﬁcant difference (P <
0.01). This suggests that above a size of several hectares, the statistical vari-
ations are averaged out. The root biomass was roughly estimated to 75 – 45
Mg ha- 1 for our study sites, consistent with the 42 Mg ha- 1 measured at Piste
de Saint-Elie (Lescure et al. 1983).

Only 19% (respectively 21%) of the trees are M 30 cm in the GP (respectively
PP) but they contribute to 69% (respectively 71%) of the basal area and as
much as 79% (respectively 81%) of the aboveground biomass. The inﬂuence of
large trees in estimating the average biomass of an area is even more pro-
nounced when we consider trees M 70 cm dbh. Only 12 to 13 large trees ha- 1
are found (about 2.5% of the trees) but they contribute to 39% of the biomass
in the GP (36% in the PP). Therefore, the critical size of the sampling area
can be related to the number of large trees in the sample. As a rule of thumb,
an area with more than 100 large trees (M 70 cm dbh in rain forests) gives a
statistically averaged biomass estimate.

For comparison, we have used the allometric equations developed in Lescure
et al. (1983), which was used recently (Roggy et al. 1999). The average biomass
computed with this method yields 428 Mg ha- 1 in the PP plot, a 36% increase
compared with the result of the present work. Likewise, the quadratic equation
proposed in Brown (1997): AGTB =21.30 - 6.95 D + 0.74 D2 yielded 242 Mg
ha- 1 also for the PP plot, that is a 23% decrease. The fact that the latter
regression equation underestimates the biomass has already been discussed by
Clark & Clark (2000).

Spatial variability of the biomass estimate for the Nouragues

Trees M 30 cm dbh contribute to 80 – 4% (SD) of the biomass in the 22 ha
sampled to 10 cm in dbh. Thus biomass estimates from trees M 30 cm dbh is
strongly correlated with the estimates using all trees M 10 cm dbh. This rela-
tionship offered the possibility to compute the biomass for the entire 82-ha
permanent plot. The hectare-by-hectare estimates are highly variable, and
range from 28 to 423 Mg ha- 1, as shown in Figure 4.

The histogram of these 82 values (Figure 5) shows that the 9 ha correspond-
ing to the liana forest (southern tip of the GP) support much less biomass than
the rest of the plot (less than 100 Mg ha- 1). On the other hand, two units have
more than 400 Mg ha- 1. When the 9 ha of the liana forest are discarded, the
average biomass estimate is 284 Mg ha- 1. However, the standard deviation is
as much as 55 Mg ha- 1 (n = 71). This is to be compared with the 95% conﬁdence
interval resulting from the allometric regression (typically 30 Mg ha- 1). The
spatial variability signalled by a broad histogram in Figure 5 cannot be an
artefact of our allometric equation. Therefore, estimating the biomass from
only one hectare would have yielded a typical error of – 20% on the result, due
to the sampling error for large trees.

Figure 5. Histogram of aboveground biomass of trees in the 82 1-ha sampling units of the Nouragues
Research Station. The frequency distribution shows two distinct patterns: nine sampling units show a bio-
mass < 100 Mg ha- 1, and correspond to a part of the plot dominated by lianas (cf. Fig. 4, upper left part of
the GP plot). From 150 Mg ha- 1 and above (i.e. excluding the nine units dominated by the liana forest), the
average of the distribution is 284 Mg ha- 1 (SD = 55 Mg ha- 1).

Variation of the biomass in time at Piste de Saint-Elie

To evaluate the change in biomass over time, we analysed two transects of
Piste de Saint-Elie, on which all trees M 5 cm dbh were measured ﬁrst in 1981
and then again in 1991. No such data were available at the Nouragues research
station. The trees were tagged so we knew which trees were recruits and which
ones had died during the 10-y span. Therefore, the trees’ net primary produc-
tion NPP (uptake of carbon by trees present at both censuses) and the net
ecosystem production NEP (uptake of carbon by trees from photosynthesis
minus losses through death) could be estimated.

Trees between 5 cm and 10 cm dbh represent 2 to 4% of the total biomass
(Lescure et al. 1983), and the fraction of biomass contained in trees M 30 cm dbh
is slightly lower than in the Nouragues. The changes in biomass are similar for
all dbh classes, although the ﬂuctuations in stem numbers are not as regular.

In transect 1, the estimated biomass rose from 314 Mg ha- 1 in 1981 to 333
Mg ha- 1 in 1991, thus gaining 6.1% (NEP = 1.9 Mg ha- 1 y- 1, 95% CI: 0.2 Mg

to recruits was 0.11 Mg ha- 1 y- 1. The biomass accumulation in trees present
both in 1981 and in 1991 was NPP = 3.2 Mg ha- 1 y- 1. This signiﬁcant increase
both in NPP and NEP was mainly due to the disturbance dynamics (the closure
of a treefall gap during this period).

In transect 2, the biomass increased from 338 to 345 Mg ha- 1 that is +1.9%
(NEP = 0.7 Mg ha- 1 y- 1, 95% CI: 0.2 Mg ha- 1 y- 1). The NPP was 2.8 Mg ha- 1
y- 1, the gain due to recruits of 0.12 Mg ha- 1 y- 1, and the loss 2.2 Mg ha- 1 y- 1
(mortality). Therefore, the biomass turnover rate (NPP) was around 3 Mg ha- 1
y-1 at the Piste de Saint-Elie research station during this period.

DISCUSSION

Reliability of biomass estimates

The range of variation in the parameters is intrinsically large and the estima-
tion of this range is far more important that the precise estimation of the average
value. Overall, a Monte-Carlo sampling has shown that our average estimate had
an error of – 30 Mg ha- 1 around the mean (95% CI), which means an error of

The aboveground biomass estimates rely on several assumptions, and those
should not be understated. First, the coefﬁcient a
is estimated at - 2.00 – 0.27
(SD) while the exponent b is assumed constant (b = 2.42). This result comes
from a relatively large number of trees, yet from heterogeneous sources (Table
2). It would be extremely useful to obtain more reliable data. However, Figure
3 and statistical tests indicate that the allometric Eqn (1) is a better regression
equation than a quadratic equation (Brown 1997). So far, no study has
addressed the issue of the intrinsic error induced by the use of a regression
equation, though several papers have attempted to ﬁnd the best-ﬁt regression
(Arau´jo et al. 1999, Lescure et al. 1983, Overman et al. 1994) with quite incon-
clusive results. The main problem with these regression equations is that their
reliability degrades as the diameter increases, resulting in a strong discrepancy
in the estimates for large trees. The power-law equation suggested in Lescure
et al. (1983) yielded a 39% over-estimate of total biomass compared with our
estimate, while Brown’s

about – 10%. This error is related to the variability of plant functional types, and
could only be reduced using other surrogate variables, such as wood density, plant
form geometry, or bole height. More importantly, this assumes that the regres-
sion model was constructed from a large tree sample, which is not strictly valid.
For example, a sample twice as big in size (e.g. 800 trees) may lead to signiﬁcant
changes in the allometric equation. This caution should be borne in mind when
attempting to estimate the carbon pools over large spatial scales (Dixon et al.
1994). Most regression models to date are parameterized with a very small
number of large trees (M 70 cm dbh). For example, Higuchi et al. (1998) have
used a dataset with ﬁve large trees. We have used 32 measurements for large
trees in the present work, which is still too few.

Finally, although the biomass of lianas is generally believed to be small (Putz
1983), in disturbed areas such as liana forests small trees and lianas contribute
more to the total biomass. Therefore we have certainly underestimated the
error in the nine plots of the liana forest.

Inﬂuence of soil and ﬁne-resolution variability

The inﬂuence of soil characteristics on the uptake capacity of organic matter
has been long debated. Recent studies in the neotropics (Laurance et al. 1999,
Roggy et al. 1999) found that nutrient content of the soil signiﬁcantly affected
the carbon storage capacity of a forest. At the Nouragues, the two subplots PP
and GP are on different soils. Excluding the liana forest, we found no clear
evidence of a correlation between soil and aboveground biomass. It seems that
small ﬂuctuations in soil nutrient content mainly affect ﬂoristic characteristics
(Newbery & Proctor 1984), although they were recently claimed to account for
as much as a third of the observed biomass variability (Laurance et al. 1999)
in a large-scale experiment of the Brazilian lowland rain forest. The most
relevant cause of spatial variability in biomass is related to water retention
and drainage capacity. Indeed a clear correlation has been found between well-
drained soils and large trees in various forests (Condit et al. 1995, Lescure &
Boulet 1985). We are unable to conﬁrm this particular point since both sub-
plots PP and GP have very similar drainage.

Our results show the signiﬁcant spatial variability of biomass at a ﬁne-scale
resolution. This is a clear illustration of the disturbance-driven, mosaic-like
patterns in an old-growth forest, which have been observed for a long time (the
sylvigenetic cycle of Aubre´ville 1938, Halle´ et al. 1978, Rie´ra 1995). Hence, the
ﬁrst cause of spatial variability of biomass seems to be related to disturbances
rather than deterministic factors (edaphic variability). This hypothesis was con-
ﬁrmed in our study at Piste de Saint-Elie, where the variability in biomass was
shown to be correlated to canopy gap openings. Analysis of our results at the
Nouragues shows that an estimate based only on a 1-ha sampling unit would
have led to an error far greater than the error resulting from the use of an
allometric regression. This means that the choice of site position and its size
can be crucial for estimating the biomass content of a given forest, especially

94

for quantifying the forest carbon pools in tropical areas as was done in Phillips
et al. (1998) or in Houghton et al. (2000).

Temporal variability in biomass

Values found in the literature suggest a biomass accumulation (NPP) of 2–4
Mg ha- 1 y- 1 (Brown & Lugo 1990, Lugo & Brown 1992) and signiﬁcantly more for
secondary forests (Alves et al. 1997, Lugo & Brown 1992). Our result is consistent
with this estimate (3.2 Mg ha- 1 y- 1, and 2.8 Mg ha- 1 y- 1). The ingrowth rate (NEP)
was 1.9 Mg ha- 1 y- 1 (transect 1) and 0.7 Mg ha- 1 y- 1 (transect 2), consistent with
the ﬁgures proposed by Phillips et al. (1998) in Amazonia (0.97 – 0.58 Mg ha- 1, n =
40). However, the increase in transect 1 was largely due to the local disturbance
dynamics. Though, the small sample size has certainly led to a strong bias in our
estimate. In transect 1, one tree M 70 cm dbh (out of nine trees) died during the
10 y resulting in a net loss of 0.4 Mg ha- 1 y- 1 alone. In transect 2, one large tree
out of 10 died (- 0.6 Mg ha- y-1).

Increasing turnover rate certainly allows the ecosystem to store more carbon
(Phillips & Gentry 1994, Phillips et al. 1998). However, the current estimates
lack reliable error bars and therefore deciding whether increasing the atmo-
spheric CO2 concentration does increase signiﬁcantly the carbon sequestration
in rain forests is still a matter of debate (Condit 1997, Houghton et al. 2000,
Nepstad et al. 1999, Sheil 1996).

CONCLUSIONS

In the Nouragues, where no previous biomass study was available, we found an
average of 309 – 32 Mg ha- 1 over 22 ha. Using the entire 82-ha permanent
sampling plot this estimate dropped to 284 Mg ha- 1, with a spatial variability
of – 55 Mg ha- 1 (SD) and extreme values of 28 and 432 Mg ha- 1. The comple-
mentary study at Piste de Saint Elie gave estimated biomass ﬁgures of 314 and
338 Mg ha- 1 (in 1981) and 333 and 345 Mg ha- 1 (in 1991) comparable with
the values obtained at the Nouragues and with previous direct measurements
(Lescure et al. 1983).

This study suggests that the neotropical forests have carbon storage proper-
ties that would deserve further scrutiny. The most important improvement
over the present study would be to test the estimates of the regression equa-
tions with a larger dataset, especially in the large diametric classes, and to
assess their sensitivity to environmental factors.
