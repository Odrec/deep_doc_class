• “Power, for Foucault, is not something someone 
wields but ‘power/ knowledge’” (8). Explain the 
juxtaposition of terms “power/knowledge.”

• What is genealogical critique?

• Have you heard of Bourdieu’s conception of ‘the 

habitus’? How would you deﬁne it?

sociologist classiﬁes are producers not only of 
classiﬁable acts but also of acts of classiﬁcation which 
are themselves classiﬁed” (238).

structures”?

• Explain the statement, “The sense of limits implies
