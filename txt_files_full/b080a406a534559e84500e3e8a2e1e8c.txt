Which brain regions distinguish  
 
 
 
and when do they do this (time course)? 

(1) speech from non-speech sounds 
(2) speech with seen lip movements of the speaker from

Evidence from Aphasias 

8 

Broca‘s Aphasia 

a.

b.

It’s hard to eat with a spoon. 
… har eat … wit … pun. 

 speech production impaired 

 

Wernicke‘s Aphasia 

E: How are you today, Mrs. A? 
A: Yes. 
E: Have I ever tested you before? 
A: No. I mean I haven’t. 
E: Can you tell me what your name is? 
A: No, I don’t I… right I’m right now here. 
E: What is your address? 
A: I cud if I can help these this like you know… to 
make it. We are seeing for him. That is my father. 

 speech comprehension impaired 

Transcortical Sensory Aphasia 
 very similar to Wernicke‘s 
 BUT: repetition intact 
 post-phonemic deficit 
      (pITL: MTG & ITG)

Speech Processing   –   Experiment   –   Discussion 

Problems: Wernicke-Geschwind Model 

10 

 Broca‘s area is not exclusively expressive,  

Wernicke‘s area is not exclusively receptive 
 

 regions other than Wernicke‘s & Broca‘s area involved 

 

 different subregions perform different functions  

 functional subdivision necessary

Speech Processing   –   Experiment   –   Discussion 

Discussion: Speech vs. Non-Speech 

24 

 Regions involved in speech processing stages beyond PAC 

 STG: sound-based representations, aSTG: ventral stream, pSTG: dorsal stream 
 MTG: conceptual-semantic representations 
 Angular Gyrus: semantic processing  easily predictable words 
 Cingulate Isthmus & Precuneus: discourse processing 

 Exceptions 

 Lingual gyrus: often disregarded as reflecting different cognitive mechanism (visual) 

 lingual gyrus might be important 

 Superior Parietal Lobe: more strongly activated during phonetic judgment task than 

during passive speech perception 
 active, attentional aspects of speech perception 

 Cuneus & Occipital Pole: traditional visual areas 

 visual cortex can be selectively activated by speech (native language) 
 but: possible that due to confounding visual factor 

 

Speech Processing   –   Experiment   –   Discussion 

Discussion: Speech with Lips vs. Speech without Lips 

25 

 STS (& lateral aspect of STG): site of audiovisual integration 
 Planum Temporale (of STG): PT not restricted to early auditory processing 
 Angular Gyrus: maps visual information onto representations of language 

 maps visual information on speaker‘s lip movements onto speech representations 
 

 Less clear: MTG, ITG, Precuneus & Posterior Cingulate, Fusiform Gyrus, Superior & 

Middle Occipital Gyrus 
 many of them: speech processing regions 

 visual information on the speaker's lip movements significantly  
      influences speech processing 
 there may be a „common code“ underlying both auditory & visual speech info, 
     BUT visual info treated differently than auditory 

 
 

Speech Processing   –   Experiment   –   Discussion 

Discussion: Time Course 

26 

 may reflect information flow  connectivity analysis 

 

 strong differences in differentiation times across electrodes in same region 

1.

2.

speech vs. non-speech: superior parietal lobe, precuneus, MTG, lingual gyrus and 
fusiform gyrus 
speech with lips vs. speech without lips: MTG, lateral aspect of STG and ITG  
(also: precuneus & cingulate isthmus) 

 same region = part of different functional networks / pathways 
 functional subdivision necessary
