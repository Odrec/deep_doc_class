[...] We do this type of interviewing all  the time / because we think you can only learn 
general features of a certain culture - of a certain people - if you do do it in 
concentrating on unique cases \ you know \ you  have to start with unique cases - then 
you have to compare it and so it would be a real gift to us / if you could tell us as far as 
it poss as it is possible in a in a short time your life history / take in a account a little 
bit the special situation of being in in Wales / [...] we did not think it would be 
possible to to interview one of our teachers / we thought it might not be appropriate / 
but I think it is so interesting what you told us - so I dared to ask you \ when we have 
done the interview and we would look at it / you would get a copy and you can think if 
something is in it which you would not wouldn’t have liked to tell #us / then you can 
#probably most of it will be yes 
you tell us / you tell us and if we would use it for publication we would ask you what 
to use and what not and we would mask of course if it is especially on Nant Gwrtheyrn 
/ it will be difficult and we’ll have to talk about it \ but you can be sure I do this type of 
interviewing interviews for twenty years or so and I never did any harm to anybody \ 
that’s alright then #it’s always 
then you can be 
the first time always in there \ always the #first time \ (laughing) 
#yeah (laughing) okay then just please you know we if you tell us your life history / we 
would not interrupt you \ we would try to be good listeners - only if we cannot follow 
the line of your storytelling we would step in \ but we jot down a few notes / and later 
on / if we would have the time we would ask you about it \ but we would not like to 
cut your red thread because then it would be #spoiled \ 
#yes \ 
so be not concerned that we keep our mouth shut \ 
that’s alright you can you can it might be a lot easier if you would suit me maybe ask 
me a few questions on the way anyway \ 
yeah \ sure \ yeah \ so may would be nice if you just think back and you have to decide 
when your life history started / if it would be with something which you apparently did 
/ that you give (laughing) that you got be conceived? you know / #(laughing) 
#yes hopefully that happened (laughing) yes \ 
yeah all the your first remembrances everybody does it differently \ (laughing) 
yeah \ so right then \ well I was eh I was born eh back in 1963 / so if you were all here 
you can all send me a birthday card next month / 5th of october to make (...) if you 
want to / so I was born in a small local hospital in just outside seven miles away \ um 
I’ve got two brothers / eh one is twentyeight / the other one is twenty six / both of them 
are married / I’m I’m still looking for a wife / so if you have got any ideas on that line / 
it will be very much appreciated - it could help me a lot in this / (laughing) I was I was 
born in Glenberrel / and eh I was raised in a Welsh family / Welsh background / em 
that’s it exept for my grandmother \ eh my grandmother was Irish \ em and I had 
usually spoke English / to a certain extent with her \ but the first eleven years of my 
life / (0.580) em (2.348) as far as eh my lang the language was concerned / I did 
everything eh through the medium of Welsh \ and I didn’t know any anything else / 
exept for Welsh \ did hear a little bit of of English - and so on - but the early years it 
was certainly Welsh \ and I think but Welsh \ all my friends em and all my family / 
who lived in the area / all spoke Welsh \ so that was the natural language that was the 
only language that I knew for many many years \ #eh
