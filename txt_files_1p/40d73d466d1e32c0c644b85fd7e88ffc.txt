I   INTRODUCTION: ENLIGHTENED SHAREHOLDER VALUE 

AND SECTION 172 OF COMPANIES ACT 2006 

The  economic  difficulties  that  have  beset  Western  economies  since  the 
financial  crisis  of  2008–09  have  prompted  policy-makers  in  many  countries  to 
place  an  increasing  emphasis  on  the  need  to  foster  a  long  term  perspective  in 
business  decisions.1  This  narrative  has  sparked  renewed  interest  in  the 
‘enlightened shareholder value’ provisions in section 172 of the United Kingdom 
(‘UK’) Companies Act 2006 (UK) (‘Companies Act’), which requires directors to 
have  regard  to  a  range  of  interests  in  discharging  their  duty  to  promote  the 
success of their company.2 

Section  172  of  the  Companies  Act  enshrines  the  principle  of  enlightened 
shareholder value (‘ESV’) into UK company law by appending to the directors’ 
duty to ‘promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a

discharging the duty. The ESV principles in section 172 are stated with a high

‘good’  conduct  by  directors  rather  than  specific  instructions  to  undertake,  or 
refrain from undertaking, any particular actions. Nonetheless, section 171(1)(a)–

paper remains, however, entirely my own.  
In the UK, for example, the current Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition have promoted, 
respectively ‘moral capitalism’ and ‘responsible capitalism’. See, eg, ‘Cameron's “Moral Capitalism” 
Vision’, The Guardian (online), 19 January 2012 <http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/feedarticle/10048672>; 
‘Ed Miliband's Speech on Responsible Capitalism’, UK Labour Party, 19 January 2012

See, eg, Jingchen Zhao, ‘Promoting More Socially Responsible Corporations through UK Company Law 
after the 2008 Financial Crisis: The Turning of the Crisis Compass’ (2011) 22 International Company 
and Commercial Law Review 275, 283; Virginia Harper Ho, ‘“Enlightened Shareholder Value”: 
Corporate Governance Beyond the Shareholder-Stakeholder Divide’ (2010) 36 Journal of Corporation 
Law 61. See also Andrew Keay, ‘Risk, Shareholder Pressure and Short-Termism in Financial Institutions: 
Does Enlightened Shareholder Value Offer a Panacea?’ (2011) 5 Law and Financial Markets Review 435, 
though Keay argues that enlightened shareholder value is unlikely to prove useful in combating short-
termism by boards of financial companies.
