“HARLEM” BY LANGSTON HUGHES (1951)

What happens to a dream deferred?

      Does it dry up 
      like a raisin in the sun? 
      Or fester like a sore— 
      And then run? 
      Does it stink like rotten meat? 
      Or crust and sugar over— 
      like a syrupy sweet?

      Maybe it just sags 
      like a heavy load.

      Or does it explode?
