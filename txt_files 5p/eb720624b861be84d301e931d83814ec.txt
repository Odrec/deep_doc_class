Introduction
Infants usually comprehend individual words and simple
sentences at the age of 10 months and they produce their first
words, which are mostly context-bound (Barrett, 1995), at 10 to 15
months of age (Benedict,1979).

There are several studies investigating different aspects of sound-
object association in infant word-learning processes. According to
infants are able to build new
Tincoff and Jusczyk (1999),
references at the age of six months at the latest. On contrary
there are several studies providing evidence for first learned word-
object associations at the age around 12-14 months (Smith and Yu,
2008; Werker et al. 1998, Woodward and Hoyne, 1999).

With our study we want to investigate whether infants at the age of
10 to 20 months are able to learn the word of a novel object by
second order association to its sound.
In our group we especially focused on how the infants” performance
is influenced by personal variables, such as age, sex, pregnancy
week, developmental history and medication. We hypothesized
that older infants and the ones with a faster developmental history
in detecting the right object
have a higher
according to its sound.

• There was a tendency of a 
significant correlation between 
the mean time the children were 
fixating on the correct area of 
interest (AOI) and their age, 
τ = 0.26, [-0.252; 0.658], p=0.078. 

•The accuracy of the first look was significantly related to the infant’s age, τ = 0.31, [-0.2; 
0.588]; p=0.047.
• The latency of the first look into the correct area of interest was significantly correlated
with the mean time the infants were fixating the correct area of interest overall, r= -0.575, 
[-0.872; 0.033], p=0.008.

Figure 1: Learning Phase 1 and 3 display an object with its sound, Learning Phase 2 and 4 play the label according to
the sound, Test phase disaplays both objects and plays one word, fitting to one of the objects

Methods
Participants: N = 18, German natives, including bilinguals, age 10-
20 months, (data of three infants excluded because of insufficient
data)

Eye tracking: Tobii Pro X2-60 eye tracker, collects gaze data at 300
HZ, specialized for unobtrusive eye tracking of infants

Testing:Infants were tested in a little distracting environment, sitting
on

parent’s lap, mostly using three-point-calibration

Design: Second order association learning of a picture-word
mapping

1. Learning Phase: Pairing of object + sound
2. Learning Phase: Pairing of sound + novel label
3. Repetition of Learning Phase 1 +2 in shorter sequence
4. Testing phase: Testing for object-label congruency

Stimuli:

 pictures of novel objects from the NOUN Database
 paired with the sound of an icterine warbler and a bongo
 novel word labels “fufu”, “gägä”, “kiki” and “lolo” were randomily
assigned to objects
 Infants’ attention was triggered by slight movement of objects
and a sound signal at the beginning of each phase

Figure 3: Results of Two-Way ANOVA Revealing an Interaction Effect Between Factors Sex and Motor Developmental History.  
Error bars denote one standard error around the mean 

There was a significant interaction effect between the motor developmental
history and the sex of the infants, on the mean fixating time to correct area of
interest (AOI), F(1,13) = 9.07, p = 0.01, ηp² = .411. This indicates that male and
female infants were affected differently by their motor development. Specifically
the mean fixating time to correct AOI was significantly higher in early developers
(M = 2016, SD = 681.82) than late developers (M = 969, SD = 795.77) in male
infants; however, in female infants the mean fixating time to correct AOI was
significantly higher in late developers (M = 1659, SD = 462.44) compared with
early developers (M = 833, SD = 199.39).

Data analysis
MATLAB to evaluate data of Eye-tracker
In SPSS:

ANOVA

Dependent variable: mean fixation time on correct areas
Independent variable:

Between-subject factor 1: motor developmental history (early/late)
Between-subject factor 2: sex (male/female)

PEARSON Correlation (Age, Mean Fixation Time on correct AOI)
KENDALL Rank Correlation (Age, Accuracy of looking in the appropiate AOI)

Discussion /Conclusions

Main increase in performance accuracy dependend on the age of the infant

Further data needs to be evaluated and additional research should be conducted
