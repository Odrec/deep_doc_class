Week 1: Introduction

About the Tutorial

What do we do in the tutorial?
● Go through the content of the lecture, especially through the 

questions at the end of the lecture slides

● Answer open questions 

➔ Please ask questions and feel to discuss the material!

(Optional) homework:
● Chance to get feedback to your answers of 'the questions', which is 

a good preparation for the exam

● Each week you may:

● Work on the homework alone and send me up to 3 answers
● Work on the homework in a group of 3 and answer all the 

questions

There will be 2 tutorials:
● Wednesday 4-6pm
● Thursday 12-2pm

 

 

About the Homework

Before answering a question think about:
● What are you asked to do? (i.e. draw a sketch, explain, name, 

etc.)

● What are the relevant aspects of the question? 
➔ Structure your answer according to those points!

How your answers should look like:
● short (but complete), well structured (CCC structure: context, 

content, conclusion), readable

Other notes:
● Depending on the question you should usually write full 

sentences 

● If you include figures always add labels.
● If you describe an experiment always state the general 

purpose/idea of the experiment, the methods, results, and 
conclusion.

Defining Cortical Areas

There are several ways of defining cortical areas:

● Cytoarcitectonics / Brodmann Areas (e.g. V1, M1)
● Anatomical connectivity (e.g. MT with highly myelinated 

afferents)

● Topographic maps (e.g. V1, A1, S1)
● Regional response properties (e.g. FFA that responds 

to presentation of faces)

● Gross anatomy (e.g. AIT, CIT, PIT)
● ...

Cortical Layers

Commonalities:

● Cell bodies are arranged in 6 layers 
that lie parallel to the brain surface:
● I. Molecular
● II. External granular
● III. External pyramidal
● IV. Internal granular
● V. Internal pyramidal
● VI. Multiform

● Input layers: 2, 4
● Output Layers: 3,5

Differences:
● thickness of the layers (e.g. thicker 

input layers in sensory areas and 
thicker output motor areas

● further subdivisions (e.g. in V1)

Energy Demand of the Brain

Energy Demand of the Brain

Which statements are correct?

✔ The brain makes up 2% of the body weight, uses 10% of the 

blood circulation and requires 20% of all energy 
consumption.

✔ Therefore a piece of brain tissue requires about 12,25 times 

more energy than the (averaged) rest of the body.

✔ The brain consumes 50% of the received oxygen.

✗

If the oxygen supply to the brain is cut off for 10 minutes, 
there will not be any permanent damage yet.

✔ Other vertebrates (except for primates) devote 2% to 8% of 

all energy consumption to the brain.

➔ The human brain is incredibly costly to maintain!

This Week's Questions

Q1: Describe the structure of afferents and major properties 

from the retina to primary visual cortex in cat and monkey.
Q2: Describe the response properties to visual stimulation of 

the two major types of neurons in primary visual cortex.

Not Covered Yet!

Q3: Make a rough sketch of a lateral view of a human cortex 

and label the 4 major axes commonly used.

Q4: Give at least 4 ways to define a cortical area. 
Q5: Which aspects of cortical layers is similar in different 

areas, which are different?

Q6: What is the energy demand of the brain relative to its size 

and in absolute terms.
