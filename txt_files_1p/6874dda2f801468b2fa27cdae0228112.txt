1. What is the sample space in roulette? What is the event space in roulette?
How many possible events are there? What is the diﬀerence between
betting $18 on the even numbers and betting $1 on each even number?
How does the bank make money?

2. The following expression is a useful variant of Bayes’ rule:

P (A | B)

P (not A | B)

=

P (B | A)

P (B | not A)

· P (A)
P (not A)

.

The left-hand side are the posterior odds that A is true. The ﬁrst term
on the right-hand side is called the likelihood ratio; the second term are
the prior odds. Convince yourself that it is correct.

3. In a famous series of studies Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky exam-
ined judgements under uncertainty. In one of their experiments partici-
pants were given the following judgement task [4]:
A cab was involved in a hit and run accident at night. Two cab companies,
the Green and the Blue, operate in the city. You are given the following
data:
(a) 85% of the cabs in the city are Green and 15% are Blue
(b) a witness identiﬁed the cab as Blue. The court tested the reliability
of the witness under the same circumstances that existed on the night of
the accident and concluded that the witness correctly identiﬁed each one
of the two colors 80% of the time and failed 20% of the time. What is
the probability that the cab involved in the accident was Blue rather than
Green?
A large number of subjects were tested and the mode and the median of
the answers is 80%. What is the correct answer? What is going wrong?

4. Is medical screening sensible [1, 2]? To diagnose colorectal cancer the
hemocult test is conducted to detect occult in the stool. For symptom-free
people over 50 years old who participate in screening using the hemocult
test the following information is available:
Thirty out of 10,000 people have colorectal cancer. Of these 30 people
with the cancer, 15 will have a positive test result (The hemocult test
is not very sensitive, its hit-rate is only 50%). Of the remaining 9,970
people without the cancer, 300 will still have a positive hemocult test (the
