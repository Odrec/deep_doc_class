This longitudinal retrospective study shows that when the results of an
organizational development intervention are fed back properly and action
plans are made, factors associated with leadership and commitments to
organization are enhanced. The study compared the eﬀects of survey feedback,
including the making of action plans and survey feedback without action
plans, to the eﬀects of no feedback at all on several psychosocial factors and
sick leave over a 3-year period. The data were derived from 1236 individuals
for whom baseline data were available and who completed a 3-year follow-up.
Applied statistics revealed that the feedback action plan group reported
greater improvements regarding leadership factors and commitment to the
organization. The results reveal no diﬀerences between the feedback groups in
regard to sick leave. There is a need for further studies, preferably with a
randomized control design, on how to enhance both the psychosocial work
environment and employee health and also how to reduce sick leave in the
workplace.

Organizations and people working in them are exposed to multiple
challenges and they all face a demanding present and future. Using
organizational development (OD) interventions is one way of managing this
successfully. The purpose of OD interventions is to enhance both the
eﬀectiveness of organizations and the well-being of their members. This is
achieved by planned interventions in the organizations’ human processes,
structures, and systems, using a knowledge of behavioural science and its
intervention methods (Beckhard, 1969).

Organizational development

interventions have been classiﬁed into
diﬀerent systems such as human processes, technostructural approaches,
and multifaceted design (Friedlander & Brown, 1974). One frequently
employed intervention is human processes (Neuman, Edwards, & Raju,
1989). Human-process interventions value human fulﬁlment and attempt to
achieve improvement in organizational performance via improved human
functioning and processes. It also attempts to alter attitudes and perceptions
by directly inﬂuencing people (Friedlander & Brown, 1974).

One widely used method in the human process approach is the survey
feedback (SF) method (French & Bell, 1999). Studies on SF have been
conducted since the early 1960s (Mann, 1961) and, in more recent years,
studies on SF have been made in Finland (Elo, Leppa¨ nen, & Sillanpa¨ a¨ ,
1998) and Norway (Skogstad & Bang, 1993). This method involves
systematically collecting data and feeding back the results to the individuals
and groups at all levels in an organization to analyse, interpret meanings,
and design action plans (Mann, 1961). Diﬀerent techniques for collecting
data can be used. The most frequently used technique is the questionnaire
(Lindstro¨ m et al., 1997). To successfully employ the questionnaire technique
the purpose of the survey should be clear and the questionnaire should
be valid and reliable (for a review see, for example, Oppenheim, 1992). The
other factor in SF is feedback, which refers to learning more about oneself,
others, group processes, and the organization. Awareness of this new
information may lead to change if the feedback is not too threatening
(French & Bell, 1999). The importance of feedback in the workplace has
been studied for decades. Hackman and Oldham (1975) regard feedback as
one of ﬁve core job dimensions that contribute to positive personal and
work outcomes. Several studies have demonstrated the impact of feedback
on individual work performance (Guzzo, Jette, & Katzell, 1985; Ivancevich
& McMahon, 1982) and group performance (Nadler, 1979; Pritchard, Jones,
Roth, Stuebing, & Ekeberg, 1988).

The number of organizations using SF in their development processes is
growing (Porras & Berg, 1978; Zippo, 1980). However, there are diﬀerent
reasons for organizations to employ SF such as to increase productivity and
to improve motivation and job satisfaction. In the Nordic countries health
and well-being are also emphasized (Lindstro¨ m et al., 1997). The SF method
does not imply focusing on speciﬁc factors at the expense of others. The
factors measured are dependent on the level
(individual, group, or
organization) on which the organization wishes to focus.

Prior research has demonstrated that process interventions such as SF
can change attitudes and behaviours (Alderfer, 1977; Beer & Walton, 1987),
at least in the short run. However, more lasting organizational change does
not always follow (Beer & Walton, 1987; Guzzo et al., 1985). A meta-
analysis has reported that SF has a moderate eﬀect on satisfaction and other

BJO¨ RKLUND ET AL.

attitudes among employees. The human-process approaches were, on the
whole, more eﬀective in modifying work attitudes compared to other
approaches such as technostructural ones (Neuman et al., 1989). Further-
more, Nadler (1977) emphasized that the results that are fed back should be
experienced as understandable, valuable, and relevant to the employees
involved.

For the organization to beneﬁt from SF, several factors should be
considered. In prior studies it has been shown that the survey should be well-
thought-out, properly planned, and characterized by the participation and
engagement of all employees (French & Bell, 1999). In a study by Mann
(1961), several suggestions or steps were indicated for SF. First, members of
the organization at the top of the hierarchy should be involved in the
planning. Second, data should be collected from all members of the
organization. Third, data should be fed back to the top executive team and
then down through the hierarchy in functional teams. Fourth, each superior
should preside at a meeting with his or her subordinates in which the data
are discussed and in which (a) subordinates are asked to interpret the data,
(b) plans are made for making constructive changes, and (c) plans are made
for the introduction of the data at the next level. Finally, an external
consultant should be presented at the feedback meeting as a resource and
should have prepared the superior.

Evaluations of feedback interventions have indicated that the feedback
itself might be a weak intervention and emphasize the importance of
eﬀective management
involvement and eﬀective worker participation
(Kluger & DeNisi, 1996). Research also indicates that the survey feedback
procedure is most successful when focusing on an integrated group (Nadler,
1977), which could be describe as a group of people sharing goals and are
characterized to a high degree by interdependence and role diﬀerentiation.
Thus, it seems reasonable to expect that if the criteria for the SF process
suggested by Mann (1961) are satisﬁed, there will be a higher probability
that the intervention will be successful, especially with regard to the
psychosocial work environment.

factors and employee health. Most of

Prior studies have not fully addressed the linkages between organiza-
tional
the research examining
employee participation in worksite intervention has been focused instead
on the outcomes of employee satisfaction and performance. Intervention
research that systematically tests the eﬀects of diﬀerent strategies for change
and for enhancing employee health in various organizational settings is
needed (Heaney, 2003). In this context, sick leave is a factor of certain
interest even though sick leave is only partially related to an individual’s
health (Alexanderson, 1998). For instance, an individual can experience
illness without having to take sick leave. In a recent review several social
factors have been related to sick leave (Alexanderson et al., 2003).

Al-Mursula, Vahtera, Linna, Pentti, and Kivimaki (2005) found that high
perceived control over working time reduces the adverse eﬀect on sickness
absence and especially among females. It was reported in a more recent
study that negative changes in decision latitude and job demand predicted
lengthy sickness absence, whereas increased social support resulted instead
in a reduced risk of sickness absence (Head et al., 2006). Downsizing of
the organization has been shown to increase sickness absence among
permanent employees but not among temporary employees (Vahtera et al.,
2004).

The aim of the present study was, ﬁrst, to evaluate the eﬀects of SF with
action plans and SF without action plans in comparison with a reference
group that received no feedback at all, and, second, to assess the eﬀect of
making or not making action plans on the development of psychosocial
work factors and sick leave over a 3-year period.

H1: Employees reporting having had the results fed back to them will
show a more positive development regarding job demands, job control,
social support, leadership, and organizational commitment, and
H2: a decrease in sick leave compared to employees reporting no
feedback at all.
H3: Employees reporting that the SF has led to an action plan will show a
more positive development regarding job demands, job control, social
support, leadership and organizational commitment, and
H4: a decrease in sick leave compared to employees who have had
feedback but no action plan was made.

METHOD

Survey data were collected in the study Work and Health in the Process and
Engineering Industry (AHA study) conducted from 2000 to the end of 2003
(Bergstro¨ m et al., 2004). In the AHA study, the application of evidence-
based methods within organizations and occupational health service was
evaluated primarily with regard to its eﬀects on health, but also with regard
to its inﬂuence on the psychosocial work environment. Four companies, two
from the paper industry and two from the steel and engineering industries,
took part in the study.

In accordance with SF methodology, it was suggested that a feedback
meeting should be held where results relating mainly to the psychosocial
work environment would be presented to work groups within the
organization. Factors fed back included job demands, control at work,
social interactions, leadership, and commitment to the organization. It was
also recommended that this feedback should lead to a written action plan
that speciﬁed concrete activities, how these should be carried out, and a

timetable for the point in time when they should be ﬁnished. The supervisor
together with a HR manager would be responsible for this feedback process.

Materials

Three comprehensive screening measures were carried out between 2000 and
2003. Assessment 1 (M1), was the start of the intervention and the question-
naires were sent out to each company during the year of 2000. A total of
2894 answered, giving a response rate of 69.6%. Assessment 2 (M2) was
completed after 18 months and Assessment 3 (M3) after 36 months. As
indicated in Figure 1, the study group consisted of those who had answered

Figure 1. Flow chart for the subjects. The study group consists of those who have answered
measure 1 and measure 3 and were employed at the time of measure 2. The research participants
were thus selected on the basis of their scores on the feedback questions at measure 3. Double
lines indicate feedback groups hypothesized.

at M1 and M3 and were employed at the time M2. These criteria were used
to increase the probability that the participants would have taken part in the
whole SF process and would have had an opportunity to participate in a SF
meeting, so as to get feedback from their own results in the survey and
contribute to the creation of action plans. Consequently, 2016 persons
answered at M3. Data from M1 and M3 will be analysed in the present
article. The reason for not using M2 is that no speciﬁc information was
gathered between M1 and M2 about the use of SF in the organizations.

At the third screening, participants were requested to report whether they
had received feedback in accordance with the SF methodology. The answers
to these questions were used to divide the employees into No-Feedback
(N-F), Feedback – Action Plan (F-AP), and Feedback – No Action Plan
(F-NAP) groups. The research subjects were thus selected on the basis of
their scores on the feedback questions, making this an ex post facto study
(Christensen, 1997). The reference group in this study corresponds to those
who have not had any feedback at all (N-F). The reason for this is to
discover possible diﬀerences between the F-AP and F-NAP compared to the
N-F group.

Table 1 summarizes baseline descriptive information on the subjects. As
can be seen, 1236 employees constituted the study group. One hundred and

sixty-one individuals who stated that they had a feedback meeting and had
made an action plan comprised the F-AP group. The F-NAP group
(n¼ 335) consisted of those who had a feedback meeting but where no
action plan was made. The N-F group (n¼ 740) consisted of those who
stated that they did not get any feedback. The mean age of all subjects
was 42.8 years, and three quarters of the study group were blue-collar
workers. Some 39% of the employees performed various kinds of shift
work. In Table 1, it reveals that the F-AP group had the lowest percentage
of blue-collar workers (49.7%) and the highest percentage of superiors
(23%).

Measuring instruments

QPSNordic is designed for the assessment of psychological, social, and
organizational work conditions. The rationales in selecting content areas
were that the concepts should be well grounded theoretically and have
shown an empirical connection between organizational development, work,
health, and well-being (Lindstro¨ m et al., 1997). The questionnaire was also
designed to be of practical use and provide a basis for interventions. It has
been shown to have acceptable reliability and validity (Dallner et al., 2000).
All items are ranked from 1 to 5, and indexes have been constructed to
calculate the mean of single items. Results are presented as means.

Cronbach’s alpha was reported for all indexes and the majority of the
Cronbach alpha coeﬃcients were .70 or higher, which is an acceptable alpha
(Cortina, 1993; Peterson, 1994). However, three of the scales did not have a
Cronbach alpha that was satisfactory, but still they were included in the
model because of their theoretical importance. Schmitt (1996) stated that
even relatively low .50 levels of reliability are not seriously low if a measure
has other desirable properties. In the present study here these measures were
considered to be of theoretical importance mainly due to results from prior
studies on the association between demand/control and health.

The outcome variables in the present study cover ﬁve areas from

QPSNordic and are as follows:

1.

Job demands, which address quantitative demands, decision-making
demands, and learning demands. Quantitative demands comprise four
items measuring the amount of work and working under pressure of
time (Cronbach’s alpha¼ .74), e.g., ‘‘Is your work load irregular so
that the work piles up?’’ or ‘‘Is it necessary to work at a rapid pace?’’
Decision demands comprise three items measuring whether the work
calls for fast and complicated decisions (Cronbach’s alpha ¼ .68), e.g.,
‘‘Does your work require quick decisions?’’ or ‘‘Does your work
require complex decisions?’’ Learning demands comprise three items

Downloaded by [Universität Osnabrueck] at 03:04 24 September 2013 ENHANCING THE PSYCHOSOCIAL WORK ENVIRONMENT 83

measuring diﬃculties in the tasks and demands for more education
and training (Cronbach’s alpha ¼ .63), e.g., ‘‘Are your work tasks too
diﬃcult for you?’’ or ‘‘Do you perform work tasks for which you need
more training?’’

2. Control at work, which addresses control of work pacing and
control of decision making. Control of work pacing comprises four
items measuring the ability to inﬂuence the pace of your own work,
when to take breaks, and inﬂuence on working time (Cronbach’s
alpha ¼ .81), e.g., ‘‘Can you set your own work pace?’’ or ‘‘Can you
decide yourself when you are going to take a break?’’ Control of
decision making comprises ﬁve items measuring the ability to
inﬂuence how your own work is done, the amount of work, and
decisions important to your work (Cronbach’s alpha¼ .66), e.g., ‘‘If
there are alternative methods for doing your work, can you choose
which method to use?’’ or ‘‘Can you inﬂuence the amount of work
assigned to you?’’

3. Social interactions that evince support from a superior and from co-
workers. Support from a superior comprises three items measuring
support and help from the most immediate in your daily work,
whether he or she is ready to listen to problems regarding the work
and whether your work is appreciated by your superior (Cronbach’s
alpha ¼ .82), e.g., ‘‘If needed, can you get support and help with your
work from your immediate superior?’’ Support from co-workers
comprises two items measuring support and help from co-workers
and whether they are willing to listen to work-related problems
(Cronbach’s alpha ¼ .80), e.g., ‘‘If needed, are your co-workers willing
to listen to your work-related problems?’’

4. Two dimensions of leadership, namely empowering leadership and fair
leadership. Empowering leadership comprises three items measuring a
leader’s ability to motivate, spread energy and enthusiasm, encourage
employees to express their opinions, and provide opportunities for
individual development (Cronbach’s alpha¼ .84), e.g., ‘‘Does your
immediate superior encourage you to participate in important
decisions?’’ Fair leadership comprises three items measuring justice
in leadership and making sure that tasks are evenly distributed
and that employees are treated fairly and intervening if relations with
the closest supervisor are stressful (Cronbach’s alpha ¼ .72), e.g.,
‘‘Does your immediate superior distribute the work fairly and
impartially?’’

5. Commitment to the organization comprises three items measuring the
employees’ attitudes to their organization, whether their personal
values correspond with those of the company, whether the work
inspires them to do their best, and whether they are willing to speak

BJO¨ RKLUND ET AL.
well of the organization (Cronbach’s alpha¼ .80), e.g., ‘‘I praise this
organization to my friends as a great place to work’’ or ‘‘My values
are very similar to the organization’s values?’’

Sick leave (sick-listing) contains information about sick leave (days per
month) and is obtained from each company’s pay register, where sick leaves
are recorded. Part-time sick leave was equated with full-time sick leave.

Statistical analyses

To facilitate the interpretation of the data change scores, eﬀect sizes
(Beaton, Hogg-Johnson, & Bombardier, 1997; Cohen, 1988) and the
standard response mean (Beaton et al., 1997) between M1 and M3 were
calculated for the three SF groups. To provide a simultaneous analysis of
multiple independent and dependent variables, a multivariate analysis of
for multivariate eﬀects
covariance (MANCOVA) was applied to test
followed by an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)
the
psychosocial work environment scales (Grimm & Yarnold, 1997). Figures
from paired comparisons of the three feedback groups were used as the
univariate outcome of the analyses. Baseline data on the outcome variables
and contract of employment were used as covariates (controlled for) in all
analyses. The change in sick leave was analysed using odds ratios from
logistic regression. A decrease in sickness in 2003 compared to 2000 was
deﬁned as a success and an increase or an equal amount of sickness absence
in 2003 compared to 2000 was deﬁned as a failure in the analysis. However,
all individuals with no sick-listing at both occasions were considered as
success cases. All statistical analyses were calculated using SPSS 13.0 for
Windows.

for each of

RESULTS

The mean values from M1 and M3, observed change scores and standard-
ized eﬀect sizes (SES), and standard response mean (SRM) of the outcome
variables are given in Table 2. Even though the eﬀect sizes can be considered
relatively small (.2 – .5) (Beaton et al., 1997), the Feedback Action Plan
group (F-AP) has consistently higher SES on all factors except quantitative
demands compared to the other Feedback groups.
The MANCOVA, which considered all 10 psychosocial work environ-
ment variables simultaneously, was statistically signiﬁcant: Wilks’ L¼ .95,
F(20, 2376)¼ 2.9, p 5 .001. The results of the ANCOVAs are presented in
Tables 3 and 4. As can be seen in Table 3, individuals in the F-AP group
report signiﬁcant improvement
in four of the ten psychosocial work
environment variables compared to the N-F group (support from superior,

empowering leadership, fair leadership, and commitment to the organiza-
tion). In the F-NAP group, the only signiﬁcant diﬀerence was that it
experienced less demands over time regarding diﬀerent aspects of learning
than the N-F group. Baseline scores of the outcome variables and employ-
ment contract of employment have been controlled for in all analyses.

Table 4 shows that the individuals in the F-AP group report signiﬁcant
improvement in four of the ten psychosocial work environment variables

sick leave. The odds ratio (conﬁdence interval in parenthesis) for a de-
crease in sickness absence for the F-AP group was 1.49 (.97 – 2.29; p¼ .07)
and for the F-NAP group 1.03 (.77 – 1.36; p¼ .86). Consequently, no statis-
tically signiﬁcant reduction in sick leave was found in any of the feedback
groups.

Altogether, the results revealed more positive developments regarding
leadership and commitment to the organization for the feedback – action
plan group than for the feedback – no action plan group and no-feedback
group.

DISCUSSION

The feedback – action plan (F-AP) group reported greater improvements
regarding leadership factors and commitment to the organization compared
to both the feedback – no action plan (F-NAP) group and the no-feedback
(N-F) group. In this respect, the hypothesis that the F-AP group would
show a more positive development regarding diﬀerent aspects of the
psychosocial work environment was conﬁrmed. However, neither the
F-NAP nor the F-AP group showed any relevant improvements regarding
job demands and control at work. Contrary to the hypotheses, leadership
and commitment to the organization did not improve in the F-NAP group
as compared to the N-F group. The hypothesis regarding a decrease in
sick leave in the F-AP and F-NAP groups as compared to the N-F
group was not conﬁrmed since patterns of sick leave were similar in
all three groups. The results indicate that it is not suﬃcient only to
give employees feedback about results. If the goal is to enhance leadership
and commitment to the organization, action plans must be implemented.
The second hypothesis was set up to establish whether those who get
feedback but do not make any action plan improve compared to those
getting no feedback at all. The results reveal a signiﬁcant improvement
regarding learning demands; however, this hypothesis was not supported
in this study. From this we conclude that it is not enough just to
give overall feedback about a work environment intervention. It is the
creation of an action plan with concrete activities to enhance the work
environment that yields improvements regarding factors in the psycho-
social environment.

Comparison of the baseline data for the three groups reveals that the
F-AP group had higher mean values than both the F-NAP and N-F
groups for both empowering and fair leadership (Table 2). Since baseline
data were controlled for in the analyses, the greater improvements in the
F-AP group cannot be attributed to these diﬀerences. However,
the
baseline data may indicate that the F-AP group included leaders who
already operated in an empowering way and allowed co-workers to

participate and have an inﬂuence on their working conditions. According
to Turner, Barling, and Zacharatos (2002), one way that may improve
the experience of work is to encourage workers to actively engage in their
work environment. One can speculate that the leaders in these groups might
have higher competence and skills when it comes to the feedback process.
This may result in more successful feedback sessions and the better the
interaction is between the superior and his/her employees, the higher the
probability that the feedback will create an opportunity to improve the work
environment (Skogstad & Bang, 1993). Based on the results in this study, we
suggest that written action plans can constitute a successful method for
enhancing leadership factors. Furthermore, something that has not been
addressed in this study but might be important for a successful SF process is a
systematic follow-up and evaluation not only of the action plans developed
but also of the planned activities (Brown, 1972). Such a follow-up will
probably increase compliance with the action plan, thereby enabling long-
term continuity and a systematic approach to the enhancement of the work
environment, and it also serves to evaluate the planned activities. These
activities are related to reﬂexivity and the concepts of reﬂection, planning,
and action (West, 1996). West (2000) concludes that teams who reﬂect on
problems, processes, objectives, and strategies are more eﬀective than those
who do not.

Even though SF seems to be important for the development of leadership
and commitment to an organization, the results reveal that job demands and
control at work were not directly aﬀected by SF and a concomitant action
plan. In this study, the demand and control dimensions refer mainly to work
assignments (e.g., ‘‘Is your work load irregular so that the work piles up?’’ or
‘‘Can you set your own work pace?’’). It may be that these work assignments
are inﬂuenced by many other external factors that are not amenable to being
addressed by an SF meeting (e.g., economic circumstances, long-term goals,
the amount of incoming orders, or increased workload). Other factors that
may also be more externally controlled are work ﬂow, work routines, and the
like. Consequently, these factors will probably be aﬀected by measures taken
at other levels of the organization.

No signiﬁcant diﬀerences were found between diﬀerent feedback groups
regarding sick leave. This result may indicate that more speciﬁc or power-
ful interventions are required to have any eﬀect on sick leave (e.g., an inter-
vention with the speciﬁc goal of reducing sick leave) or that the intervention
has a long-term eﬀect. Sick leave is only partly related to an individual’s
health (Alexanderson, 1998) and our knowledge of
the causes and
consequences of sick leave and how they can be inﬂuenced is limited and
there is a need for more and better research regarding the development of
theories, methodologies, and concepts in this regard (Alexanderson et al.,
2003).

Methodological limitations

It was estimated that the interventions carried out would produce positive
eﬀects within 3 years. During this time such factors as organizational
changes, shifts in markets, activities related to the work environment, and
competence development may have had an impact on the outcomes. These
are important occurrences that are necessary to reveal and describe
(Bergstro¨ m et al., 2004) and highlight the complexity in this area of
research.

As noted in the Method section, feedback groups were not randomly
assigned but were selected on the basis of questions about whether they had
received feedback. It is therefore possible that an external confounding
variable that was correlated with the stated level of feedback but was not
included in the analyses produced the diﬀerences
in the measured
psychosocial work environment variables. However, to lower the risk that
pre-existing diﬀerences between the groups may have aﬀected the results, the
baseline scores of the outcome variables and employment contract were
controlled for.

The structure of feedback and how well it is organized can diﬀer between
the four organizations. This study did not examine exactly how the feedback
meetings were conducted. However, the instructions given to the organiza-
tions about how the feedback meetings should be held and the action plans
developed were the same, and contact persons at each company have been
trained in how to hold the feedback meeting (Bergstro¨ m et al., 2004).
Hopefully,
the feedback meetings have been
conducted in a tolerably similar manner with regard to the organization
concerned. Nevertheless, we cannot be completely sure about how the action
plans were arrived at, communicated, or tracked. Therefore, it would have
been desirable to have available more follow-up information about the
feedback sessions and action plans.

this will guarantee that

Conclusions and further research

leadership and commitment

The present study shows that when results from an organizational
development intervention are fed back properly and action plans are made,
perceptions of
to the organization are
enhanced. Even if this study does not directly address the relationship
between health and organizational level interventions, it is important to
study these factors together and to examine the relations between employee
and organizational health. Such a study will require a more comprehensive
approach encompassing factors both in the psychosocial environment,
health, performance, and productivity, and in the relationships between
intervention strategies, etc. (Bennet, Cook, & Pelletier, 2003). Further

studies are needed, preferably with a randomized control trial design and
also addressing methodological challenges. In this particular study, we did
not have any information about the action plans and whether or not any
concrete activities followed. Therefore, it would be desirable to study the
subject further.
