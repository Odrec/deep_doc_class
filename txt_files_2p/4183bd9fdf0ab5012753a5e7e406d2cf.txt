Abstract

This paper describes key urban development strategies pursued during the last seven years by the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro,
the second largest city in Brazil. It discloses internal processes, organisational restructuring of the municipality and institutional
changes geared to increase eective urban management and resource mobilisation required to implement multiple sector pro-
grammes and key projects in several locations in the city like Favela Bairro and Rio Cidade Programmes, The Rio Strategic Plan,
etc. It is argued that the formation of interdepartmental working groups for better horizontal articulation of policy making and
implementation, the creation of the ®nancial and accounting unit, the decentralisation of authority towards sub-municipality levels,
and capacity strengthening of its personnel ± among other things ± have made a positive impact on the performance of local
government. The paper further highlights a signi®cant change towards policies of urban consolidation and revitalisation of declined
areas of the city supported by heavy public investments and the eort towards broader civil society involvement in municipal
projects. Municipal autonomy, problem-solving and result-oriented type of planning and management and organisational change
are some of the lessons pinpointed by the paper for a city of that size and complexity. Ó 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

1. Introduction

This paper describes key urban development strate-
gies pursued by the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro over
the last seven years during which the local government
undertook innovative actions that resulted in noticeable
improvements in urban management. One of the ob-
jectives is to disclose some of the internal processes and
measures taken by the local government in order to
generate resources and forge eective management
needed to put into motion multiple sector programmes
and projects in several locations in the city. The indirect
involvement of the author with the Rio Cidade and
Favela Bairro programmes via a long-term capacity
building programme allowed for participant observation
and on-the-job assessment with those municipal sta
who are in charge of dierent projects. Without any
ambition to formulate a theory on urban management
the author explicitly intends to present to a wider au-
dience the peculiarities and speci®c characteristics of the

programmes and to show how some of them were
managed and the results accomplished. It is an intention
to recover lessons learned and an institutional memory
that otherwise would be circumscribed to the munici-
pality and to those directly involved in the programme.
The paper suggests that there have been fundamental
changes in policies towards the city. It argues that these
changes could not be brought about without supportive
measures, capacity building and organisational restruc-
turing and institutional changes needed to support new
approaches to urban problems. It is argued that or-
ganisational restructuring, the formation of interde-
partmental working groups for better articulation of
policy making and implementation, the decentralisation
of authority towards
sub-municipality levels, and
capacity building of its personnel ± among other things ±
have resulted in noticeable improvements in local gov-
ernment performance. The analysis of this experience is
particularly important given the fact that the population
has expressed widespread approval of current urban
development policies. This resulted in a remarkable
outcome of the 1996 election that guaranteed the con-
tinuation of a governing political party for the ®rst time

in the history of the city. The paper argues that this
provided for continuity in stang, policies and organi-
sational culture which in practice sets the basis for
successful urban revitalisation processes and long-term
development planning.

these pro-
grammes present in relation to previous policies relate
to the involvement of civil society organisations in the
project preparation and implementation phases and
regarding the promotion of
`urban consolidation'
principles. Though the level of participation cannot be
compared to what is found in more politically pro-
gressive Brazilian local governments like for example
Porto Alegre where an institutionalised participatory
budgeting practice actually empowers public partici-
pation in public policy de®nition via prioritisation of
municipal investments in the city. In Rio de Janeiro,
neighbourhood associations were given a more limited
space to participate in project preparation allowing at
times for rejection of proposals formulated by the
municipality. But this represents a step forward in
municipal policies in the city. There is another re-
markable change in attitude towards the favelas ± in-
formal settlements. For the ®rst
time, a city-wide
favela upgrading ± with heavy public investments and
private sector participation in project planning and
implementation ± recognised the social and physical
exclusion and the opportunities for consolidation and
integration of these settlements into the city. Through
the programme called `Favela Bairro' the municipality
abandoned the ideas of resettlement, eviction and
`blind tolerance' that characterised municipal policies
until the beginning of the 1990's.

The paper describes some organisational and man-
agement settings established to make the municipal
government more ®nancially ecient. It also presents an
analysis of dierent programmes and strategic inter-
ventions such as the Strategic Plan of the City, the
Favela Bairro ± Informal Settlement Upgrading Pro-
gramme ± and the Rio Cidade ± Urban Revitalisation
Programme. These are city-wide interventions that
brought signi®cant changes in the urban fabric with
noticeable improvements in the functioning of the city.
The articulation between these programmes, the actors
involved and the co-ordination mechanisms as well as
civil society participation are further described. The
successes as well as the shortcomings are assessed in the
light of possible future directions and issues are identi-
®ed that still need to be addressed for the development
of the city.

2. The urban, social and political context

Rio de Janeiro is Brazil's second largest and one of its
two most important cities with S~ao Paulo. The city is

known by its peculiar beauty and natural environment ±
between sea and mountain ± having its geographic set-
ting as its most important asset and an image that at-
tract tourists from all over the world. It is also the seat
of many important knowledge-based institutions and a
signi®cant industrial park especially in the petrochemi-
cal and naval sectors. It is also an important commercial
and ®nancial centre with a well established service sector
especially in the ®nancial and technological domains,
oering a wide range of services in culture, leisure and
tourism that gives the city an international pro®le. In
1960 Rio lost to Brasilia its status as capital of Brazil
and seat of the national government but still retains the
headquarters of many central government agencies.
Without a doubt Rio is the most important cultural and
tourist centre of Brazil.

In economic terms the GNP of the municipality of
Rio de Janeiro is nearly US$50 billion for a population
of 6 million inhabitants. Rio's metropolitan region has
11 million inhabitants distributed among 13 municipal-
ities within a total area of 7.4 thousand km2 (Munici-
pality of Rio de Janeiro included) and with a GNP of
nearly US$80 billion (IPEA, 1998). Altogether, the
municipalities of Rio de Janeiro and S~ao Paulo ac-
commodate nearly 20% of the total Brazilian population
of 160 million inhabitants and their economy are re-
sponsible for more than 20% of the total GNP of the
country. The Rio±S~ao Paulo axis of 429 km is in fact the
heartland of Brazil's industrialisation and the engine of
Brazil's development.

Despite its economic potentials the metropolitan re-
gion of Rio de Janeiro is marked by sharp inequalities.
The disparities between the metropolitan core and its
periphery exacerbate social exclusion and poverty. It is
in the peripheral municipalities where a signi®cant pro-
portion of low income families and an unskilled labour
force ®nd housing accommodation and have access to
cheap land. This phenomenon further materialises a
severe social spatial strati®cation at the metropolitan
level. The concentration of wealth, employment, services
and entertainment in the core municipality result in a
sizeable and continuous commuting from the periphery
to Rio de Janeiro.

In the beginning of the 1990's Rio de Janeiro was
confronted with an increasing social tensions and direct
social impacts from the serious recession faced by the
country as whole. Low-income settlements and more
speci®cally the favelas had become the focal point of
violence and insecurity with the `narcotrac' practically
establishing a parallel power and local control to the
detriment of municipal norms and the rule of law. The
squatter residents' associations that were so active dur-
ing the 1980's were under continuous strain and the
local residents were subject to intimidation, fear and
were often caught in the middle of gun ®re from gangs
and police forces.
