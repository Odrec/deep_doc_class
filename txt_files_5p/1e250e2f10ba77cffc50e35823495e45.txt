Probability Distributions 
 

We defined probability as: 
(probability that the random variable X takes the Value xi)  
 

•

A Discrete Probability Distribution:  

Rehearsal 

𝑝(𝑋 = 𝑥𝑖) 

A distribution is discrete if the random variable X is discrete, such that 
the range of X is finite or countably infinite. 

 

e.g. Poisson distribution, Bernoulli distribution, binomial distribution, 
geometric distribution, negative binomial distribution 

 

•

A Continuous Probability Distribution :  

A distribution of a random variable X is called continuous if the range of 
X is uncountably infinite. 

 

e.g. normal, uniform, chi-squared, and others.

Suppose we observe a spiking neuron in 
many trials.  

     

We are now interested in the probability to 
have a certain number of spikes in a fixed 
interval T. 
 

 

 

1  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 

  0                                               T 

If we make the bin very small, we can 
approximate the binomial distribution 
(k events in N bins) with a Poisson 
distribution.

Binary Variables  

We begin by considering the standard binomial distribution  

 

Probability to get k heads for N flips given that the probability of a 
single flip is µ  

 

 

𝑝 𝑘 µ, 𝑁 =

⋅ µ𝑘 1 − µ 𝑁−𝑘  

 
 
 
We rewrite the binomial as the product of four terms (using 𝜆 = 𝑁µ): 
 

We start with the binomial coefficient:

Now we assume that we use this model to describe a spike train using very small 
temporal bins to describe the spike train via a binary process.  

 

 

1  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 

 

 

        0                                               T 

We now reduce the bin size to a arbitrary small value which is reducing the 
probability per bin ( limes of p going to zero).  

At the same time the number of bin must grow if we want to cover the same 
temporal range between 0 and T (limes of N going to infinity).  

Moreover, we know that, irrespective of the bin size and the number of bins, the 
expected value of events in the time interval from 0 to T stays the same.  

 

We achieve this by making N large, µ small and keeping the product of µ and N 
constant at the same time.

Gray (89): Stimulus-specific neuronal oscillations

“The results demonstrate that local neuronal 
populations in the visual cortex engage in stimulus-
specific synchronous oscillations resulting from an 
intracortical mechanism. “

cortex during a precision grip task. I. Task-
dependent modulation in single-unit synchrony.  
 
“This study provides strong support for assemblies of 
neurons being synchronized during specific phases of 
a complex task …” 
 
 
Castelo-Branco (2002) Neural synchrony 
correlates with surface segregation rules 
 
„…Thus, dynamic changes in synchronization could 
encode, in a context-dependent way, relations among 
simultaneous responses to spatially superimposed 
contours …“

Cortical Neurons: Implications for Connectivity, 
Computation, and Information Coding 
 
“Detailed information about the temporal pattern of 
synaptic inputs cannot be recovered from the 
pattern of output spikes, …” 
 
 
Baker (2000): Precise spatiotemporal repeating 
patterns in monkey primary and supplementary 
motor areas occur at chance levels.  
 
„The task dependence of pattern occurrence is 
explicable as an artifact of the modulation of neural 
firing rate.“ 
 
 
Brody (99): Correlations without synchrony 
“Peaks in spike train correlograms are usually taken 
as indicative of spike timing synchronization 
between neurons. Strictly speaking, however, a 
peak merely indicates that the two spike trains were 
not independent.”  

How can that happen? Principles of statistical inference 

Inference based on a significance test: 

H0 :

Evidence for H1 ?  

Yes
