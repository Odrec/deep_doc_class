Abstract

The CagA protein of Helicobacter pylori interacts with numerous cellular factors, and is
associated with increased virulence and risk of gastric carcinoma. We present here the co-crystal
structure of a subdomain of CagA with the human kinase PAR1b/MARK2, revealing that a CagA
peptide mimics substrates of this kinase family, resembling eukaryotic protein kinase inhibitors.
Mutagenesis of conserved residues central to this interaction renders CagA inactive as an inhibitor
of MARK2.

Helicobacter pylori infects nearly 50% of the human population1,2 and has been closely
linked to duodenal and gastric ulcers and adenocarcinomas1. CagA is injected by H. pylori
into the epithelial cells lining the stomach3-8. Critical to many of the identified biological
effects of the molecule on host cells, is the so-called “repeats domain,” a region with a
strain-specific number of contiguous repeats of a 30-40 residue segment containing the
EPIYA amino acid motif (Fig. 1a)7. The repeats domain interacts with and inhibits the
PAR1/MARK (partitioning defective and MAP/microtubule affinity regulating kinases)
family of protein serine/threonine kinases9-11.

In order to understand the mechanism of CagA inhibition of PAR1/MARK kinases, we
determined the 2.2 Å crystal structure of MARK2 in complex with a sub-domain of CagA
spanning residues 885-1005 of Western H. pylori strain 26695, containing the A, B, and C
EPIYA repeats (Fig. 1, a and b, Table 1, and Supplementary Methods). Surprisingly, the
majority of this 120 amino acid CagA domain was not visible in the crystals (although
highly stable in complex with MARK2, and verified to be present by SDS-PAGE analysis of
crystals, Supplementary Fig. 1a). In particular, the EPIYA motifs were disordered, and only
a short 14 amino acid peptide possessed interpretable electron density (Fig. 1b and
Supplementary Fig. 1b). The peptide does not adopt any clear secondary structure, but
interacts with the kinase as an extended coil, burying approximately 950 Å2 of surface area.
