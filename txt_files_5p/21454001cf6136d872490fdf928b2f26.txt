 Ran into problems because R was very slow handling the size of the data set

 Switched to Python and solved the whole task in it

 Was really quick in reading and processing the csv files

Task 1

 Plot number of tweets each day per minute.

 Plot number of tweets of the related word of goal vs. time 

(per minute) for the days that have outstanding peaks 
than usual.

Plot number of tweets each day per minute.

Observations:

-third graph looks 

different

-all graphs contain a 
characteristic activity 

pattern

Plot number of tweets that contain the 
regex "g+o+a*l+|t+o+r+"

Plot number of tweets that contain the 
regex "g+o+a*l+|t+o+r+"

huge peak at: x=1285

corresponds to:

21:25:00

deutsche Sommerzeit 

(UTC +2) -2

UTC

closer look at the peak

x = 77080

corresponds to 21:24:40

regex = "f+o+u+l+|c+a+r+d+"

Peaks at x = 1169, 1173, 1216 and 1224

correspond to yellow cards at

19:29, 19:33, 20:24 and a huge foul at 20:16
