2.2.1. Introduction
Kydland’s nobel prize lecture: “The eminent researcher and 1995 Nobel 
laureate in economics, Bob Lucas, from whom I’ve learned a lot, wrote 
(Lucas, 1980): “One of the functions of theoretical economics is to provide 
fully articulated, artificial economic systems that can serve as laboratories in 
which policies that would be prohibitively expensive to experiment with in 
actual economies can be tested out at much lower cost… (696)…

… Our task, as I see it…is to write a FORTRAN program

that will accept specific economic policy rules as ‘input’ and will generate as

‘output’ statistics describing the operating characteristics of time series we

care about, which are predicted to result from these policies”.

The  desired environments to which Lucas refers would make use of 
information on “individual responses [that] can be documented relatively 
cheaply…by means of…censuses, panels [and] other surveys…” (710). Lucas 
seems to suggest that economic researchers place people in desired model 
environments and record how they behave under alternative policy rules.

• Kydland’s Nobel prize lecture summarizes the fundamental changes in 

macroeconomic modeling in the 1960s:
 Introduction of rational expectations
 Lucas critique: statistical regularities cannot be exploited for policy 

design, since they can break down in adjustment towards a newly 
introduced policy.

• The RBC models were the most straight forward outcome of these 

developments: they avoid ad hoc assumptions on expectation formation 
(derive expectation formations mathematically) and depend only fixed deep 
parameter which do not change in reaction to policy.

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

5

• Traditional Keynesian models differed in the sense that they made ad hoc 

assumptions on expectations and used estimated statistical relations to 
evaluate policy.

• Was the battle lost by the Keynesians in favor of the Walrasian classical  

economists?

• The Keynesian economists still had hard critique against the RBC 

framework. It was centered around thee main directions:

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

6

 The efficiency of business cycles: in the RBC models the cycles arise 

form agents’ optimization actions. There is no need for stabilization 
policy. In the Keynesian way of thinking recessions are a inefficient 
(wasteful) use of resources.

 The role of technology shocks: Keynesians view them as a source of 

long-term rather then short-term dynamics.

 The missing role of money and monetary factors: the RBC are solely 

based on real factors.

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

7

• The resulting modeling approach is a combination of Keynesian and RBC 

•

analysis often called new neoclassical synthesis.
It incorporates Keynesian feature into the DSGE framework of RBC 
models. It uses both rational expectations and microfoundations and is 
therefore not subject to the Lucas critique.

• A comparison between the classical RBC models and the new Keynesian 

models points to the following similarities:
 General equilibrium: all markets clear since agents adjust all 

endogenous variables to the shocks in the exogenous variables. (This 
equilibrium concept is new for the Keynesian way of thinking!).

 The adjustment is based on the intertemporal decisions of the agents. 

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

8

• How do we include monetary factors into the models?
• Basically two ways:

A. Modeling money explicitly: explicitly modeling the reasons why 

agent hold money.

B. Cashless economy: hiding money under the carpet – we know agents 
use money as an accounting unit but since it is only about accounting 
it shouldn’t influence agents behavior and can be ignored. 

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

9

A. Modeling money explicitly

• Why would agents want to hold money at all: it doesn’t earn any interest 

and is therefore unattractive. Here are three potential reasons:
 Money in the utility function: real balances directly enters the utility 
function (is not a deep explanations, rather a shortcut for modeling a 
wide-range of reasons).

 Shopping time: money reduces transaction costs 
 Cash-in-advance: agents need cash in order to pay for goods

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

10

•

In all these models the disadvantage of money that it brings no interest is 
compensated by its advantages summarized by the key functions of money:
 Medium of exchange
 Accounting unit
 Store of value
 Standard of deferred payment

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

11

B. Cashless economy
•

Ignore the store of value function and focus on money as an accounting 
unit.

• The model is written in nominal terms.
• Money demand is a simple function of GDP and the interest  rate.
• A benchmark for this modeling approach is the “classical monetary 

economy” model which introduces a distinction between real and nominal 
variables. But since nominal variables are only a unit of accounting they 
behave just as real variables suggest that they should. So there are no 
nominal frictions and therefore no role for monetary policy. The results of 
the classical monetary economy model are just as those of the RBC model.
• So we turn to a model that takes money more seriously and present next a 

baseline new Keynesian model.

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

12

2.2.2. The baseline New-Keynesian model 
• We will present the models following an algorithm similar to the one we 

used for the RBC model: 
 Setup: describe the ingredients of the model. Number of households 

and firms, utility and production functions.

 Optimization: define the FOCs resulting from the optimization 

behavior of the agents.

 Solution: derive expressions for all endogenous variables based on 

solving the FOCs.

13

Setup

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

14

• New features:

 Instead of Walrasian equilibrium we assume that agents set prices in all 

input and output markets. The assumption of perfect competition is 
abandoned and replaced by monopolistic competition.

 Remember we are looking at models that also bear Keynesian features. 

Keynesian models assume prices and wages are not fully flexible but 
sticky. They call this feature nominal rigidities.

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

15

Households:
• The representative households maximize their utility function given by:

• Consumption does not consist of a single good but is rater a bundle of  

varieties of goods:

where i denotes the specific good and 𝜖𝜖 the elasticity of substitution between 

different goods (this is needed for modeling the monopolistic competition).

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

16

• The households budget constraint is given by: 

• Pi and Ci denote prices and consumption, Wt the nominal wage, Nt the 

hours worked,  Tt the nominal lump-sum taxes, Bt is a one-period riskless 
zero bond that matures in t+1, and Qt is the price of this bond in period t.

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

17

Firms:
• An infinite number of firms producing different variety of the goods.
• All firms use the same production function. The firm producing the good’s 

variety i is also denoted with i.

• The production function (with constant returns to scale) is given by:

𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 =𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡𝑁𝑁𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖
𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡 is the technology level common to all firms.

perfect competition assumption is abandoned).

• Firms are allowed to set prices which differ from marginal costs (the

18

Optimization

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

19

• The FOCs are more complicated than in the RBC model since households 

not only decide on how much to consume altogether but how to spread 
their consumption across different varieties of goods.

• The decision of households on the consumption of different product 

varieties generates the demand curves (downward sloping) for each firm.

• Firms decide on their prices taking the demand curves under consideration.

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

20

Households
• Households consumption choice consists of 2 steps:

 Step one: Decide on how to distribute consumption across different 

product varieties given a total level of consumption expenditure.

 Step two: Determine the total consumption expenditure.

Step one: Demand for each C(i)
• The demand for each variety is determined by maximizing the bundle of 

goods subject to the restriction that households spend their total 
consumption expenditure M.

• Optimization is, therefore, based on the following Lagrangian:

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

21

• The Lagrangians derivative (and the FOC) with respect to each C(i) is 

given by: 

• How do we find the value of 𝛌𝛌?

write the FOC:

• From the definition of the bundle of goods we substitute the integral and re-

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

22

• Solving for C(i) results in:

• We can now define 𝛌𝛌by substituting                in the bundle expression and 

re-writing:

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

23

• Let’s now simplify the notation by introducing the price index 𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡:

•

Inserting in the FOC results in:

24

• …replacing 𝛌𝛌 with

Results in:

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

25

• Note that the price index 𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡 is the inverse of 𝛌𝛌:
𝛌𝛌 is also known as the shadow price: by how much would 𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 increase if 
• The FOC for 𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡(𝑖𝑖) then results in the following demand functions:

the consumption constraint (M) is marginally increased.

•

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

26

• The following differences relative to the perfect competition case should be 

noticed:
 Love of variety: the consumer buys a portion of all varieties.
 The relative price changes affect the demand for the respective goods 

depending on the elasticity of substitution 𝜖𝜖.
 If 𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 >𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡 the resulting demand is still larger than 0 and if 𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 <𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡
the resulting demand is smaller than 𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡.

 Since goods are imperfect substitutes in the utility function firms can 

increase prices without facing zero demand (monopolistic competition).

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

27

Step two: total expenditure
• Starting point is the budget constrain which can be re-written using the 

price index in the following form:

• Solving for 𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 results in:

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

28

Firms:
• Firms maximize profits taking the demand function into consideration.
• Assuming that firms have to satisfy the full demand and the price they have 

announced (no rationing condition) they will choose the price using the 
following Lagrangian:

• We take the FOCs from this Lagrangian with respect to: 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖,𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 and 
𝛌𝛌𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 .
• We further assume that each firm takes 𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡 and 𝑊𝑊𝑡𝑡 as constant since it is too 

small to influence them.

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

29

• The resulting optimal price is: 

• Noting that           is just the marginal cost, we can re-write the price as:

= Markup*Marginal cost

Markup= 𝜖𝜖𝜖𝜖−1 depend only on the elasticity of substitution, the smaller 𝜖𝜖, the 

larger the markup.

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

30

• The introduction of monopolistic competition leads to higher prices (prices 

are scaled by the markup)

• However prices are still just a scaling factor. 
• There is no reason to expect any real effect of monetary factors if prices are 

just scaled by a markup factor.

• This will not be the case if prices are not fully flexible and do not react one 

to one to monetary policy changes.
If prices are sticky (=if they do not automatically adjust to money supply 
changes) monetary policy can play a substantial role.

• David Humes (1752): “Were all the gold in England annihilated at once, 

and one and twenty shillings substituted in the place of every guinea, would 
money be more plentiful or interest lower? No surely: We should only use 
silver instead of gold.” (Lukas, 1995)

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

32

• David Humes (1752): “There is always an interval before matters be 

adjusted to their new situation, and this interval is as pernicious to industry 
when gold and silver are diminishing as it is advantageous when these 
metals are increasing. The workman has not the same employment from the 
manufacturer or merchant though he pays the same price for everything in 
the market. The farmer cannot dispose of his corn and cattle, though he 
must pay the same rent to his landlord. The poverty, and beggary, and sloth 
which must ensue are easily foreseen.” (Lukas, 1995)

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

33

We will devote a separate chapter on price stickiness, note here just some 
stylized facts:
• Prices have an average duration (across product groups) of 4 to 6 months 

(Bils and Klenow).

• Duration is substantially lower if we account for sales (Nakamura and 

Steinsson).

• There is a substantial variation across the stickiness of different product 

groups. 

• Prices are stickier downwards than upwards.

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

34

• Prices can be stickier because of a variety of reasons: menu costs, 

information costs.

• Also the price-changing rules can differ. The most prominent examples are:

 Time-dependent price setting
 State-dependent price setting
 Both will be discussed in detail in the chapter on price rigidities; we 

will focus here on the most prominent time-dependent rule: Calvo
pricing.

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

35

•

In a Calvo pricing scheme (Calvo, 1983) each firm faces a constant 
probability to change its price in each period of time.

• A fraction1−𝜃𝜃 of all firms are given the possibility to change their prices 
in each period, the rest of the firms ( a fraction 𝜃𝜃) has to keep their prices 

unchanged at least until the next period. The probability of each firm to be 
allowed to change its price does not depend on whether it just changed the 
price in the previous period.

• Calvo price setting is a short cut with a lot of limitations but has been 

widely used because of its analytical tractability. 

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

36

• The fact that prices are not allowed to change in every period makes the 

price setting an intertemporal problem: firms care not only about 
optimization of today’s profits but also account for the fact that tomorrow 
they might have the same price although conditions have changed.

• Today’s prices, therefore, matter for tomorrows profits.
• Today’s profits are:

where 𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 is today’s price, 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 today’s sales of firm i and        is the nominal 

cost function (= the cost at period t of producing Yi

t).

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

37

• Tomorrow’s expected profits are:

where                                                   is the stochastic discount factor between 
period t and t+1. Qt,t+1 is equal to the price of a bond that pays one unit

In this case tomorrows expected profits are:

• Therefore, when choosing Pi

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

39

• This was the two-period case. In reality the firm has to account for the 

effect of today’s price on the infinitely many periods that follow:

• This maximization problem is solved subject to the demand constraints:

• The demand constraints tell us that demand for firm i’s product will depend 

on its price relative to the price index.

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

40

• The FOCs for the firm’s problem is:

where the markup                 and the nominal marginal costs

have been introduced  on p. 30.

• Note that if 𝜃𝜃=0 each firm can reset its price in every period so that:

41

Solution

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

42

• As with the RBC models the solution, based on using the FOCs to find the 

expressions for all variables and all time period,  follows three steps:
 Find the relevant steady-states
 Linearize the first-order conditions
 Find the equilibrium.

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

43

• Start with the first step: finding the relevant steady-states.

• Divide the firms’ FOC

by 𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡−1 and re-write 𝑄𝑄𝑡𝑡,𝑡𝑡+𝑘𝑘 in two parts: the non-stationary 𝛽𝛽𝑘𝑘and a part that 

in the steady-state is equal to 1:

• The FOC then takes the following form: 

where                                       are the real marginal costs in period t+k.

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

44

• Therefore, marginal costs and output are constant over time even if the firm 

does not change the price:

• Since the price level in general is not defined in the steady state assume that 

inflation is zero and 𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡∗𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡+1=1.
• The definition of Λ𝑡𝑡,𝑡𝑡+𝑘𝑘 implies that it is equal to one in a steady state.

• Therefore, in steady state the FOC then takes the following form:

which implies that the marginal costs MC are equal to 

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

45

• Next linearize the FOCs.
• For this purpose we re-write the FOC from p. 41 as follows:

• Let’s then linearize the left-hand side of the condition:

• The linearization of the right hand side results in: 

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

46

• Combining the right-hand side and the left-hand size we can cancel out Λ 

and yi. The result is: 

• Noting that �𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚t+k=log MCt+k-log(1/Μ)= logMCt+k+log(Μ) we get: 

•

In words: a firm that is allowed to reset its price will set the price so that it 
is above the current and the expected nominal marginal costs.

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

47

• The weight of future marginal costs in the determination of the price 

depends on both the discount factor and the probability of changing the 
price.

• How does the aggregate price index behave?

identical they all choose to reset according to the same rule described 
on p. 47.

 A fraction 1-𝜃𝜃 of all firms can reset their  prices. Since they are 
 A fraction 𝜃𝜃 does not reset. In sum the aggregate price index is equal

to:

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

48

Linearizing the price level

• Start with the following transformation (divide by 𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡−1and raise to the 
power of 1−𝜖𝜖):
• ∏𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 gross inflation which in our zero inflation scenario is equal to one, the 
same is true for the ratio 𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡∗𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡−1.
where 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡denotes the percentage deviation from the steady state gross inflation 

Linearization around this state, therefore,  yields:

•

(which we assume  to be equal to 1)

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

49

• Returning to the optimal price we get:

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

50

• From here on it follows that:

and

•

•

In sum: inflation today is a discounted sum of today’s and future’s marginal 
costs.
Intuition: if firms expect their costs to rise tomorrow and anticipate that 
they might not be able to adjust their prices when the costs change they 
change the price already today.

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

51

• Let’s return to the general equilibrium.
•

It requires clearing of both :
 The goods market, and
 The labor market

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

52

• The equilibrium in the goods market requires that production of each 

product variety equals the demand for this product variety.

• For the individual product variety:

• And the bundle:

•

=𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡

• From there on and from the linearized Euler equation it follows that: 

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

53

• The equilibrium in the labor market requires that supply and demand of 

labor clear.

• Analytically, the labor market clearing (accounting for the goods market’s 

clearing and demand functions) can be expressed as:

• After linearization we get: 

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

54

In this last expression the linearization of                                   is denoted by 

𝑑𝑑𝑡𝑡 and has the interpretation of price dispersion (and the resulting output 

dispersion).

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

55

• Which is the natural level of output (= the output level if prices are free to 

adjust)?
In a world without nominal rigidities firms will set the prices so that in each 
period they’ll be equal to marginal costs plus markup. 

•

• Nominal marginal costs are: 

• Dividing by P gives the real marginal costs:

• After linearization: 

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

56

• Substituting the linearized wage yields:

•

•

and taking into account that in equilibrium ��𝑦𝑦= ̂𝑚𝑚:
If we denote the natural level of output by 𝑦𝑦𝑛𝑛 t:

=> 

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

57

• The output gap (= the difference between the output with sticky prices and 

output with flexible prices=                     ) is therefore determined by:

• Combining this equation with the equation about inflation:

yields:

• You actually remember a very similar relation from your undergraduate 

macro classes: the Phillips curve.

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

58

• The representation given here is known as the New Keynesian Phillips 

Curve. It will be the first building block of the system.

• Let’s now review in the DSGE framework another theoretical concept that 

you already know: the IS curve (= relation between interest rate and 
aggregate demand).

• We turn back to the output equation

and re-write it in terms of output gap:

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

59

• From there on it follows that:

•

rn is the natural rate of the interest rate and is equal to

• This equation is known as the dynamic IS equation and represents the 

second building block of our system. 

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

60

• Taken together: 

 the new Keynesian Philips Curve and the Dynamic IS equation 

describe the non-policy side of the model (everything is governed by 
households and firms optimization behavior).

 In order to close the model we need to understand how do policy 

makers behave.

Advanced Macroeconomics - SS 2016 - Prof. Dr. Valeriya Dinger

61

• We focus here on monetary policy, so the policy rule we examine is interest 

rate setting rule.

• A surprisingly simple rule has dominated much of the modeling. It has been 

suggested by John Taylor (1993) and is often called “Taylor rule”.
It says that the nominal interest rate is equal to: 

•

where i denotes the steady-state nominal interest rate.
• This rule can be generalized to: 

which gives the third building block of the model.

if we “feed” it with appropriate parameter values.
If we calibrate with the following values:

we get the following theoretical impulse responses.
