␣oscillations (8 –14 Hz) greatly influence brain activity, yet we generally do not experience them consciously: the world does not appear
to oscillate. Dedicated strategies must exist in the brain to prevent these oscillations from disrupting normal processing. Could suitable
stimuli fool these strategies and lead to the conscious experience of our own brain oscillations? We describe and explore a novel illusion
in which the center of a static wheel stimulus (with 30 – 40 spokes) is experienced as flickering when viewed in the visual periphery. The
key feature of this illusion is that the stimulus fluctuations are experienced as a regular and consistent flicker, which our human observers
estimated at ⬃9 Hz during a psychophysical matching task. Correspondingly, the occipital ␣rhythm of the EEG was the only oscillation
that showed a time course compatible with the reported illusion: when ␣amplitude was strong, the probability of reporting illusory
flicker increased. The peak oscillatory frequency for these flicker-induced modulations was significantly correlated, on a subject-by-
subject basis, with the individual ␣frequency measured during rest, in the absence of visual stimulation. Finally, although the effect is
strongest during eye movements, we showed that stimulus motion relative to the retina is not necessary to perceive the illusion: the flicker
can also be perceived on the afterimage of the wheel, yet by definition this afterimage is stationary on the retina. We conclude that this new
flickering illusion is a unique way to experience the ␣rhythms that constantly occur in the brain but normally remain unnoticed.

Introduction
Neuronal oscillations, such as the ␣rhythm (Berger, 1929) (8 –14
Hz), pervade the brain and influence sensory processing (Makeig
et al., 2002; Thut et al., 2006; Hanslmayr et al., 2007; van Dijk et
al., 2008). In particular, recent findings showed that visual process-
ing is more efficient at certain phases of the ongoing ␣rhythm than
others (Busch et al., 2009; Mathewson et al., 2009; Busch and Van-
Rullen, 2010; Dugue´ et al., 2011; Scheeringa et al., 2011). It is surpris-
ing to realize, therefore, that the sensory outcome itself is unaffected:
we do not perceive the world as oscillating. The brain must have
developed strategies to conceal the consequences of oscillations from
our perception. For instance, the brain could rely on one or more of
the following mechanisms: (1) conscious experience may arise from
brain regions far removed from those where ␣ is produced and
found to influence sensory processing; (2) attention, a major factor
in the selection of information for awareness, is known to decrease
the amplitude of ␣oscillations (Worden et al., 2000; Thut et al., 2006;
Klimesch et al., 2007), thereby dampening their potential perceptual
consequences; and (3) finally, one could envision that any recurring
“temporal gaps” in perception produced by the periodic pulses of ␣

inhibition (Jensen and Mazaheri, 2010) could be actively “filled in”
using immediately preceding and/or following visual information to
even out our conscious perceptual experience (similarly to the
filling-in of the blind spot in early representations of visual space).
Regardless of which of these (or other) strategies is actually used by
the brain to conceal perceptual effects of ␣rhythms, it is tempting to
ask whether suitable stimuli could fool these strategies and lead to the
conscious experience of our own brain oscillations.

Here we report on a novel illusion in which the center of a sta-
tionary wheel made up of ⬃30–40 spokes appears to flicker vividly
and regularly (Fig. 1). The flicker occurs most strongly during small
eye movements performed with the stimulus in the periphery. How-
ever, we show that stimulus motion relative to the retina is not cru-
cial to perceive the illusory flicker: flicker can also be experienced on
the afterimage of the stimulus; yet by definition, this afterimage is
stationary on the retina. Using psychophysics, we demonstrate that
the illusory flicker frequency peaks within the ␣range (⬃9 Hz). To
address the neuronal basis of the illusion, we recorded EEG while
observers (N ⫽ 20) performed smooth pursuit eye movements, fol-
lowing with their gaze a slowly rotating dot around the stationary
wheel. The flicker illusion was maximal for specific eye positions
around the wheel. The only EEG frequency band that displayed a
compatible time course was the ␣rhythm (8–14 Hz) over occipital
electrodes: an increased ␣magnitude specifically coincided with
the occurrence of illusory flicker. Furthermore, the frequency
that was maximally modulated during illusory perception was
significantly correlated with the individual ␣ frequency on a
subject-by-subject basis. We conclude that this new flickering
illusion represents a unique way to consciously experience the
brain’s ongoing ␣rhythm.
