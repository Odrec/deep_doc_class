Recombinant DNA technology 

 
 
 

A series of steps used to join together (ligate) DNA 
segments of different origin, creating a hybride molecule 
(recombinant DNA) that can be replicated in a host cell & 
isolated (cloning) for further analysis and manipulation

amounts (e.g. recombinant insulin)

a product with novel, improved properties  
(protein engineering)

Historical milestones 

 
1865 - Gregor Mendel - shows that the inheritance of certain traits 
in pea plants is determined by pairs of factors (“genes”) that are 
transferred independently onto reproductive cells 
 
1869 - Frederich Meischner - isolates “nucleine” from nuclei of 
white blood cells harvested from pus-soaked bandages obtained 
from nearby hospital: nucleïne contains phosphor, but no sulfur 
(hence distinct from protein)  
 
 
1910 - Thomas Hunt Morgan - shows that “genes” are part of 
“chromosomes” by localizing a gene on a specific chromosome 
 
1928 - Fred Griffith - discovers the principal of “bacterial 
transformation”

reinforced the conclusion of Avery: 

 DNA carries the genetic code! 

Yet, still important details remained  

to be uncovered… 

How does DNA… 
 
1) store information? 
2) duplicate itself? 

These questions would be answered by 
discovering DNA’s structure... 

The race to discover DNA’s structure

1953 Linus Pauling publishes DNA triple helix model

       did Pauling overlook? 

“At once I felt something 
was not right. I realized 
that …… a giant had 
forgotten elementary 
college chemistry.”

• Uniform width of 2 nm (3.4 Å) 
• Bases stacked 0.34 nm apart

• Adenine pairs with thymine 
• Cytosine pairs with guanine  

What they came up with on their own: 
 
• Bases face inward, phosphates & sugars outward 
• Hydrogen bonding 
• Hinted at semi-conservative model for replication

Eukaryotic expression systems 
 
Preferred over bacterial expression system for production of  
eukaryotic proteins, such as “protein pharmaceuticals” 

Q6: Why ? 

Eukaryotic proteins often not correctly folded, leading to their 
accumulation in bacterial‘inclusion bodies’> loss of bioactivity 
 
Bioactivity of eukaryotic proteins often dependent on post-
translational modifications by enzymes that are absent in 
prokaryotes (e.g. N & O-glycosylation; amidation, acetylation) 
 
Proteins purified from bacteria can be contaminated by toxic cell 
wall components (e.g. lipopolysacchariden > septic shock) 

Gene transfer in eukaryotic cells 
Traditional methods (transfection) 

DEAE dextran  – carbohydrate polymer coupled to positively-charged group 
(diethylaminoethyl) forms complex with DNA; uptake by endocytosis 

 
 

 
 

Calcium phosphate – forms insoluble complex with DNA; uptake by 
endocytosis  

Lipofectamine  –  DNA delivered in liposomes that fuse with the plasma 
membrane 
 
Electroporation  –  generation of transient pores in plasma membrane 
allowing passage of DNA 
 
Microinjection  –  DNA directly injected into cell nucleus 
 

Virus-mediated gene transfer (infection) 
By far the most efficient method for gene transfer! 
(took millions of years of trial and error) 

Frequently used viral expression sytems 

SV40 virus 

Baculovirus - large (200 kb) dsDNA virus that can infect 
insect cells only. Very safe system.  
 
Simian SV40 virus - dsDNA tumor virus. Primarily infects 
monkey cells. 
 
Vaccinia virus - large ssDNA virus. Infects a wide array of 
mammalian cells.  
 
Adenovirus - dsDNA tumor virus. Infects a wide array of 
mammalian cells, including non-dividing cells such as 
neurons. Frequently used in gene therapy trials.  
 
Lentivirus - Retrovirus (e.g. HIV). ssRNA genome, which 
is converted to dsDNA after infection of host. Infects 
essentially every type of mammalian cell without lysing the 
host. First choice vector system for gene therapy.

Immuno-screening 
 identification of gene with antibody against gene product 

Applications 

1 

You purified a protein and want to search for the 
corresponding gene 

2 

You purified an antibody and want to identify the 
corresponding antigen  
(e.g. for diagnostics and treatment of infectious diseases, 
auto-immune disorders, cancer, etc)

Quiz 
 
1) Bacteria use restriction-modification systems to protect themselves against  
    infection with bacteriophages. Describe the molecular basis of these systems.     
    Describe 2 strategies by which bacteriophages can escape from these systems. 
 
2) Protein pharmaceuticals like recombinant growth hormone are preferentially  
    produced in eukaryotic expression systems. Explain why.  
 
3) What is a genomic DNA library? What is a cDNA library? Describe in what  
    aspects these libraries differ from each other. 
 
4) What is “low stringency” hybridization-screening? Describe how this method  
    can help identify novel genes.  
 
5) DNA polymerases display “proof-reading” activity. Explain what this means.  
    Describe the molecular basis of this activity. Some organisms have DNA  
    polymerases that lack proof-reading activity. What advantage could this have?
