Summary

OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that as a minority with lower socio-economic status, Turkish residents in
Germany might experience a higher mortality than Germans.
METHODS All-cause mortality rates by age group and sex of Turkish and German adults for the time period
1980–94 were calculated from death registry data and mid-year population estimates.
RESULTS The age-adjusted mortality rate (per 100000) of Turkish males aged 25–65 years resident in
Germany was 299 in 1980 and 247 in 1990, consistently half that of German males. The mortality of Turkish
females in Germany was 140 in 1990, half that of German females. Mortality of Turkish males/females in
Ankara was 835 and 426 in 1990.
CONCLUSION In view of the socio-economic status of Turkish residents in Germany the large mortality
difference compared to Germans is unexpected. It cannot be fully explained by a selection at the time of
hiring (healthy migrant effect) because it lasts over decades and extends into the second generation. A
healthy worker effect is unlikely because Turkish residents have a lower employment rate than Germans.
There is little evidence for movement of gravely ill persons back to Turkey. An ‘unhealthy re-migration effect’
in which socially successful migrants with a lower mortality risk stay in the host country while less successful
ones return home even before becoming manifestly ill would partly explain our ﬁndings.

Introduction

Migration within Europe is an on-going social phenomenon
of large scale. It affects the health of individual migrants as
well as that of populations (Bollini & Siem 1995; Elkeles &
Seifert 1996). Since the 1950s, millions of people have
temporarily migrated to Germany looking for work. About
900 000 people came from Turkey between 1963 and 1973.
Many of these Gastarbeiter (guestworkers) settled and
brought their families. They were joined by asylum seekers
from Turkey. Turkish nationals now form the largest foreign

nationality group in Germany. Their number increased from
1.5 to 2 million between 1980 and 1994 (Statistisches
Bundesamt 1996), with a brief decrease in 1985 after ﬁnancial
incentives for re-migration were offered by the German
Government.

People who migrate, whether their move is temporary or

permanent, are on average healthier than the population they
originate from, and often also healthier than the population
of their host country (Swerdlow 1991; Williams 1993; Parkin
1993). This ‘healthy migrant effect’ is due to a self-selection
process: the chronically ill and disabled are less likely to
migrate. Among migrants there are also particularly
courageous, innovative and socially skilled individuals
(Schiffauer 1991).

O. Razum et al. Mortality of  Turkish residents in Germany

Once they have moved to their host country, however,

migrant workers are often a minority with lower social status
than the host population. Numerous studies show that low
socio-economic position and minority status are associated
with chronic stress (Collatz 1994), higher morbidity (Marmot
et al. 1991; Bollini & Siem 1995; Elkeles & Seifert 1996) and
mortality (Davey Smith et al. 1990; Geronimus et al. 1996).
Foreign nationals employed in Germany were found to have
particularly high health risks (Oppen 1985; Elkeles & Seifert
1996) and higher occupational accident rates (Weber et al.
1990) than Germans; chronic diseases are more frequent and
emerge at a younger age (Collatz 1994). Turkish residents in
Germany are believed to suffer from more severe forms of
coronary heart disease than Germans at a younger age (Bilgin
et al. 1994). They also have higher unemployment rates (Sen
1996) and less access to appropriate medical care (Collatz
1994). Many second-generation Turkish nationals born in
Germany are not fully integrated into either the German or
the Turkish culture (Collatz 1996).

So far, one study (Weber et al. 1990) compared mortality

rates of foreigners in Germany (not differentiated by
nationality) to mortality rates of the German population for
the period 1984–86. In the age group 35 to 65 years, age-
standardized all-cause mortality of foreigners was roughly
half that of Germans. The authors assumed that this was due
to a healthy migrant effect and re-migration of severely ill
individuals.

Little is known about time trends in mortality of migrants.

Cancer mortality rates in immigrants tend to be lower
initially and converge upon the rates of the host population
with increasing length of stay (Thomas & Karagas 1987).
Regarding all-cause mortality, there are indications that
initial advantages in comparison with the host population
may be maintained over years (Swerdlow 1991; Balzi et al.
1993) before wearing off (Williams 1993; Chaturvedi &
McKeigue 1994), but data are scarce.

Thus the hypothesis emerges that the mortality rate of

migrants from Turkey to Germany would initially have been
lower than that of Turks residing in Turkey and possibly that
of Germans. Over time and in the second generation, the
healthy migrant effect would wear off. To test this hypothesis
we compared all-cause mortality of Turkish residents in
Germany, Germans, and Turks living in Turkey in the period
1980–94.

Materials and methods

We extracted all-cause mortality of Turkish nationals
residing in (former West) Germany in the time period
1980–94 from annual registry data and calculated age and
sex-speciﬁc as well as age-standardized mortality rates. For
comparison, we present mortality rates of adult Germans

and of the adult population of Ankara in Turkey. Rates for
the age group 25 to under 65 years were obtained by direct
standardization using deaths in 5-year age bands (Ankara: 10-
year bands) and the German ‘standard’ population of 1987
(Statistisches Bundesamt 1991).

Denominator populations and death registration in
Germany

Population ﬁgures 1980 to 1994 by sex and age group of
Germans and of Turkish nationals residing in Germany were
obtained from the Federal Statistical Ofﬁce. German
population ﬁgures are projected forward anually, based on the
1970 and 1987 census results. Population ﬁgures of foreigners
are continuously updated by the central registry of foreigners.
From age 65 years upwards, the number of Turkish residents
is small and a breakdown by age is not available. As some
retirees remain registered in Germany but spend considerable
time in Turkey, their deaths may not be registered in
Germany. Therefore we excluded the age group 65 years and
above from the analysis. Data on migration, unemployment
and naturalization were compiled from ofﬁcial sources
(Statistisches Bundesamt 1980–1994; Cornelsen 1990;
Statistisches Bundesamt 1996).

Death ﬁgures of Germans based on death certiﬁcates were

supplied by the Federal Statistical Ofﬁce. Deaths of foreign
residents are registered by nationality only at the statistical
ofﬁces of the federal states; the place of birth is not speciﬁed.
Mortality data for Turkish residents are not routinely
available. For this study, data from all federal states of former
West Germany were compiled at the statistical ofﬁce of the
state of Baden-Württemberg. Figures exclude Turkish visitors
to Germany and former Turkish nationals who obtained a
German passport (double citizenship is not legally possible).

To calculate death rates, we estimated mid-year

populations (MYP) as the mean of the population on 31
December of the actual and of the preceding year. For
1980–84, population ﬁgures for Turkish residents are
available only for 30 September. We used these directly as the
best available estimate of MYP.

Denominator population and death registration in
Turkey

In Turkey, national censuses are carried out ﬁve-yearly with
enumeration on a present-in-area basis (State Institute of
Statistics 1980–1990a). Substantial internal migration affects
the precision of estimates for between-census years. Deaths
(but not mortality rates) are reported from province and
district centres (State Institute of Statistics 1980–1990b). It is
assumed that in spite of legal notiﬁcation requirements there
is underreporting of deaths, particularly in rural areas. For
