act on uncertainty about past linguistic input

In prevailing approaches to human sentence comprehension, the
outcome of the word recognition process is assumed to be a
categorical representation with no residual uncertainty. Yet per-
ception is inevitably uncertain, and a system making optimal use of
available information might retain this uncertainty and interac-
tively recruit grammatical analysis and subsequent perceptual
input to help resolve it. To test for the possibility of such an
interaction, we tracked readers’ eye movements as they read
sentences constructed to vary in (i) whether an early word had near
neighbors of a different grammatical category, and (ii) how
strongly another word further downstream cohered grammatically
with these potential near neighbors. Eye movements indicated
that readers maintain uncertain beliefs about previously read word
identities, revise these beliefs on the basis of relative grammatical
consistency with subsequent input, and use these changing beliefs
to guide saccadic behavior in ways consistent with principles of
rational probabilistic inference.

psycholinguistics 兩 language comprehension 兩
probabilistic models of cognition

A critical part of understanding a sentence is identifying the

words that comprise it. It is well understood that humans
achieve this goal through a combination of top-down (contex-
tual) and bottom-up (perceptual) cues (1, 2). In spoken word
recognition, comprehenders’ conclusions about a given word’s
identity can be affected by phonetic and lexical cues from
adjacent words (3, 4), and by subsequent semantic context when
the speech stream is manipulated to make bottom-up evidence
ambiguous (5, 6). It has also recently become clear that even
relatively unambiguous bottom-up evidence regarding spoken
word identity can be overridden by subsequent evidence within
the same word (7, 8). It is unknown, however, whether word-
identity uncertainty is maintained as a matter of course after
perceptual cues have been encountered in full upon hearing or
first reading a word in a sentence. It could be that, under normal
circumstances, a categorical commitment is made to a unique
candidate word, which is then integrated into an incremental
sentence representation. Such a strategy could be efficient if
considerable effort is required to construct and maintain syn-
tactic/semantic relationships for multiple candidate words at a
given position within the sentence (9). This possibility also
coincides with the treatment of grammatical analysis in most
formal models of language comprehension as a process that
takes a word sequence as its input (10–12), and with the
treatment in leading models of eye-movement control in reading
(13, 14). On the other hand, it is also possible that the perceptual
input from a given word gives rise to multiple candidate word
representations entering the stream of syntactic/semantic pro-
cessing. This strategy would have the advantage of greater
robustness, permitting identification and correction of percep-
tual noise or speaker error early in a sentence on the basis of
additional
information obtained late in a sentence (15). In
addition, maintaining and continually reassessing uncertainty
about word identity could be useful in guiding behavior during
real-time comprehension. In reading, eye movements could be
directed to previous parts of a sentence where word-identity

uncertainty is high; in spoken language comprehension, alloca-
tion of attentional resources could be updated on the basis of
word uncertainty, or the listener could prompt the speaker for
clarification about parts of a message that were unclear. Whether
uncertainty about word identity is maintained and revised, and
if so, according to what principles, is thus a question of funda-
mental interest in the study of language comprehension.

A Sharp Test for Word-Level Uncertainty
In the past, providing a sharp test of whether word-identity
uncertainty is maintained has proven elusive because existing
results could be interpreted as involving categorical word mis-
identification. For example, the word flour is reread more often
in sentence 1a than in sentence 1b or than the word wheat in
sentence 1c (16):
1a. He swept the flour that he spilled.
1b. The baker needed more flour for the special bread.
1c. He swept the wheat that he spilled.
Crucially, the word flour has an orthographically similar ‘‘near-
neighbor,’’ floor, that is semantically incompatible with the
continuations of sentences 1a or 1c. The sentence-initial context
in sentence 1a is more strongly predictive of floor than of flour,
so it is possible that the distinctive rereading behavior is due to
the comprehender initially maintaining some uncertainty as to
whether the critical word was flour or floor, and subsequently
returning to this word to confirm that it is indeed flour. This same
result could, however, be obtained under a theory in which
uncertainty about word identity is not maintained after initial
word recognition, but there is an occasional categorical misiden-
tification of flour as floor in sentence 1a upon first reading, and
the incongruous downstream word spilled triggers a return of the
eyes to the initial locus of semantic anomaly.

In the present work, we provide a sharper test of whether
word-identity uncertainty is maintained by using sentences in
which categorical misidentification should in principle facilitate,
rather than hinder, downstream processing. We turn to sentences
with a combination of grammatical constructions that has at-
tracted considerable recent attention for the theoretically prob-
lematic comprehension behavior it elicits. Despite near meaning
equivalence, sentence 2a is considerably more difficult to read
and comprehend than sentences 2b and 2c (17–19):
2a. The coach smiled at the player tossed the frisbee.
2b. The coach smiled at the player thrown the frisbee.
2c. The coach smiled at the player who was tossed the frisbee.

Processing difficulty in sentence 2a is localized at the word
tossed, whose grammatical part of speech is in principle ambig-
uous between finite verb and past participle (17). This difficulty
pattern is similar to that obtained in classic ‘‘garden-path’’
sentences such as the horse raced past the barn fell (20), where the
part-of-speech ambiguity of raced permits a misanalysis of raced
past the barn as part of the sentence’s main clause when in fact
it is a reduced relative clause that is part of the sentence’s
main-clause subject. There is a critical difference in sentences
like 2a, however, in that the potentially ambiguous word tossed
appears at a point in the sentence where the prior context (in
particular the words smiled at, which signal that the player is
inside a verb-modifying prepositional phrase) should rule out
this main-clause misanalysis. The comprehension difficulty ob-
served for this and similar types of sentences (19, 21) is at odds
with a long history of theoretical accounts and empirical evi-
dence that prior context guides inferences about the grammatical
analysis of new words in a sentence (10–12, 22–25), and thus
poses a major challenge for most leading accounts of language
comprehension.

One way in which these results could be reconciled with a
strong guiding role of prior context is if the representation of
prior context is less categorical than has previously been as-
sumed. Levy (15) recently proposed a model in which these
results arise from a combination of top-down grammatically
driven expectations with nonveridical bottom-up input through
noisy-channel Bayesian inference. This move is analogous to
probabilistic and constraint-based approaches that assume prob-
ability distributions over structural analyses of a sentence (10–
12, 26–29), only in this case probability distributions are ex-
tended over the content of the sentence, as well as over its
analysis. In this model, the comprehender takes perceptual noise
into account when making inferences about sentence form and
structure, so that at all times the comprehender has a probability
distribution over the sequence of words comprising the current
sentence, taking into account perceptually similar and gram-
matically permissible variants of the sentence read thus far. In an
experimental setting, researchers know the true sentence w*
presented to a reader, but cannot observe the noisy perceptual
input I on which the reader bases his/her inferences about
sentence form and structure. However, we can marginalize over
I to obtain expected inferences as follows:

P C共I兩w兲P T共I兩w*兲

P C共I兲

⬀ PC共w兲Q共w, w*兲,

where PC is a probability distribution encoding the comprehend-
er’s knowledge of his/her language and environment, PT is the
true distribution of perceptual noise, and Q(w,w*) is propor-
tional to the integral in Eq. 1 and represents the average effect
of perceptual noise. To model the behavioral consequences of
reading a new word wi* in a sentence, Levy (15) assumed that if
wi* dramatically changes the comprehender’s beliefs about the
earlier content of a sentence, then the comprehender will tend
to respond behaviorally by longer fixation times and possibly
making regressive saccades. If Pi(w[0,j)) is defined to be the
probability distribution over the sequence of words starting at
the beginning of the sentence and continuing up to but not
including the position occupied by wj*, conditioning on the
input obtained from words w1…i*, the Kullback-
perceptual
Leibler (K-L) divergence D(Pi(w[0,i))储Pi⫺1(w[0,i))) is a natural
metric quantifying the change in this probability distribution
sentence induced by reading wi* (30).

In this model of rational probabilistic inference under uncer-
tain input, the behavioral difficulty of sentence 2a arises because

Size of change (K-L divergence) in expected probability distribution

tences 2 and 3, under noisy-channel Bayesian inference. The parameter ␭,
expressing the level of perceptual noise, is free in the model; over a wide range
of parameter values, the sentence types observed to be harder for humans to
process are those in which the shift in probability distribution is larger.
Variants of the true context have probability exponentially decreasing in ␭

model details.

the conditional probability of tossed given the true preceding
context is considerably lower than its conditional probability
given visually similar but grammatically different contexts, such
as those obtained by substituting for at the orthographically
similar (near-neighbor) words as or and, or by inserting who after
coach or player. This difference in conditional probability arises
because any of these substitutions or insertions changes the
sentence‘s grammatical structure such that the word after player
is highly likely to be a finite verb. As a result, when the model
is instantiated using a probabilistic context-free grammar esti-
mated from the parsed Brown corpus (31, 32) and a noise
function Q based on the Levenshtein distance between words in
w and w*, Bayesian inference upon reading tossed creates a large
shift in the probability distribution over preceding-context word
sequences away from the true context and toward these near-
neighbor contexts; reading thrown in sentence 2b does not lead
to a similar shift because it cannot be a finite verb (Fig. 1, black
and green lines). If reading is influenced by principles of rational
inference and decision theory, then these large changes in belief
about prior context would be likely to induce comprehenders to
slow their reading rate, and would be likely to trigger regressive
eye movements to earlier parts of a text and the locus of
uncertainty.

Crucial to this model, however, is the comprehender’s ability to
maintain uncertainty about the identities of words that have already
been read. Furthermore, if the prior context is changed such that
there are fewer near-neighbor contexts for which the conditional
probability of the critical word tossed is higher than under the true
context, then in the model the ensuing shift of the probability
distribution over preceding contexts at the critical word should be
reduced. This observation leads to an experimental design in which
comprehenders read not only sentences like 2a and 2b but also

variants of these sentences in which the word at is substituted by the
word toward, as in sentences 3a and 3b:
3a. The coach smiled toward the player tossed the frisbee.
3b. The coach smiled toward the player thrown the frisbee.
Because toward does not have near-neighbor words under which
the player would be a grammatical subject, the shift in belief
about preceding context upon reading the verb tossed—but not
thrown—is considerably reduced (Fig. 1, orange and magenta
lines). In behavioral correlates of processing difficulty at this
critical verb in the sentence, we should therefore see an inter-
action between the word used in the preceding context (at versus
toward) and the superficial part-of-speech ambiguity of the word
in this position (tossed, ambiguous; thrown, unambiguous).

Experiment
Our experiment tested the prediction described above of an
interaction between near-neighborhood of the preceding context
and superficial ambiguity of the critical word on measures of
processing difficulty in sentence reading. We constructed 24 sets
of sentences on the pattern of sentences 2a and b and 3a and b;
the four versions of each sentence differed only in the immedi-
ately postverbal preposition (at versus toward) and whether the
critical participial verb had the same surface form as the verb’s
simple-past form. We tracked the eye movements of 40 native
English speakers as they read these sentences on a computer
screen and answered a yes/no comprehension question about
each sentence.

Results. Following standard practice in the analysis of reading
using eye tracking, we divided each sentence into seven regions
as shown in example 4 and analyzed seven measures of online
processing difficulty widely used in the sentence-processing
literature (33).

Final

Spill

We report here results pertinent to our hypothesis of an inter-
action between preposition in preceding context (at versus
toward) and superficial ambiguity of the critical verb (ambiguous
versus unambiguous). (Complete results are given in SI Appen-

dix.) We observed precisely the predicted interaction in three
measures of incremental processing difficulty: (i) the frequency
with which readers’ eye movements immediately after first
reading the critical verb were regressive (as opposed to progres-
sive; significant both in by-participant and by-item ANOVAs at
P ⬍ 0.05); (ii) the time spent reading between the first fixation
on the critical verb and the first fixation beyond it (significant
both in by-participant and by-item ANOVAs at P ⬍ 0.05); and
(iii) the frequency with which readers fixated on the preposition
(at or toward) after first fixating on the critical verb and before
fixating beyond it (P ⫽ 0.087 in a mixed-effects logit model). By
all of these measures, readers experienced the most difficulty in
the condition where the critical verb is superficially part-of-
speech ambiguous and near-neighbor substitutions in the pre-
ceding context would license the incorrect part of speech (Fig.
2 A–C). Additionally, readers were least likely (ANOVA inter-
actions P ⬍ 0.05) to correctly answer comprehension questions
about these sentences in this condition (Fig. 2D).† Finally, we
found that readers spent longer overall during first-pass reading
of the critical word in the ambiguous conditions (Fig. 2E;
ANOVA main effect P ⬍ 0.05 by participants, P ⬍ 0.1 by items).‡

Discussion These results provide evidence that readers maintain
uncertainty about the identities of previously read words and
that grammatical relationships that would hold between a word
at a given position and the rest of the sentence are entertained
for multiple candidate words. As measured by frequency and
duration of regressive eye movements, comprehension is most
effortful in the at⫹ambiguous condition, precisely the condition
where the discrepancy between the likelihood of the critical word
given the true preceding context versus near-neighbor contexts
most strongly favors the near-neighbor contexts. Unlike previous

†Some of our comprehension questions speciﬁcally queried the relationship of the critical
verb with the preceding noun phrase [e.g., Did the player (toss/throw) the frisbee?], and
those questions were answered least accurately in the at⫹ambiguous condition, though
the three-way interaction was not signiﬁcant.
‡To address possible concerns regarding whether the observed patterns are driven by trials
in which participants did not ﬁxate on the preposition during ﬁrst-pass reading or by a
mismatch in main-clause plausibility between at and toward conditions, we also con-
ducted analyses of the subset of trials in which the preposition was ﬁxated during ﬁrst-pass
reading and of a subset of items for which mean plausibility was matched across at and
toward conditions on the basis of a separate norming study. In both of these analyses, the
qualitative patterns were the same as for the complete data, and in some cases they were
more highly signiﬁcant (see SI Appendix for complete analysis).

results, this result cannot be explained by occasional categorical
word misidentification: misreading and or as for at should make
the critical region easier when it is ambiguous (tossed) than when
it is unambiguous (thrown), because the misreading would make
a finite-verb analysis available.

General Discussion
Our results suggest that readers, as a matter of course, maintain
uncertain beliefs about the identities of previously read words,
revise these beliefs as a function of grammatical coherence with
subsequent linguistic input, and act rapidly on changes in these
beliefs through eye movements directed toward the loci of
changes in uncertainty. Any theory of language comprehension
in which representations of preceding context involve veridical
word representations lacking in uncertainty will have difficulty
accommodating these findings. These findings also go beyond
previous results demonstrating downstream effects of context in
spoken word recognition (3–6) in that our materials are visual
rather than auditory, were not manipulated so as to create
unusual perceptual ambiguity, and require the simultaneous
pursuit of multiple grammatical analyses of the sentence to
obtain the belief-revision behavior we observed.

Finally, our results are consistent with a picture in which key
elements of language comprehension can be viewed as instances
of rational behavior through probabilistic inference (34–36):
perceptual input obtained from eye movements is recruited
jointly with grammatical knowledge to produce evidential infer-
ences about linguistic form and structure, which in turn play a
role in guiding subsequent eye movements. Further research will
be necessary to more fully establish the full range of uncertainty
that comprehenders hold out as to word identities—whether they
consider only substitutions among closed-class words (which
would be consistent with the present experimental results) or
also entertain substitutions among open-class words, as well as
the omission, insertion, and even position swapping of linguistic
material within a sentence. Nevertheless, the view implied here
of language comprehension as jointly recruiting perceptual input
and grammatical knowledge has potentially broad consequences
for the study of language and cognition. The view simultaneously
unites and underscores the differences between research in
spoken language understanding and reading, raising new ques-
tions about the relative weighting of sensory input and prior
knowledge, and how noise (environmental, neural, and speaker
error driven) is accounted for, in the two modalities. Answers to
these questions would be of both fundamental value in cognitive
science and potential benefit in furthering our understanding of
disorders and age-related changes in both reading and spoken
language comprehension.

Methods
Materials and Procedure. We used 24 experimental items in the study and
constructed four stimulus lists, rotating items among these four conditions in

a Latin Square; complete experimental materials can be found in SI Appendix.
These 24 experimental stimuli were interleaved with 36 ﬁllers. Order of
presentation was randomized differently for each participant, subject to the
constraint that no two experimental items appeared consecutively. Forty
native-English speaking undergraduate students at the University of Califor-
nia at San Diego participated in the experiment. All had normal vision or
corrected to normal vision and were naive as to the purpose of the experi-
ment. Participants read each sentence while their eye movements were mon-
itored by an SR Eyelink 2000 eye tracker, obtaining one eye-position sample
every 1/2 ms with a spatial resolution of 0.01° (binocular viewing, recording
right eye only). Each sentence was presented on a single line in 14-point
Courier New font on a 19-in LCD monitor positioned 55 cm in front of the
participants (1° visual angle ⬇3 characters). The eye tracker was calibrated
before beginning the experiment and subsequently was recalibrated between
trials as necessary.

Regions of Analysis and Data Processing. Each trial was inspected by hand using
the University of Massachussetts EyeDoctor software suite (37). We discarded
any trial in which there was track loss before some ﬁxation in any region other
than the ﬁnal region. This process resulted in loss of 15.3% of trials. Most of
these track losses were caused by the participant blinking.

We examined a number of standard eye movement measures (33) includ-
ing: (i) the frequency with which a region was skipped on ﬁrst reading, (ii) ﬁrst
ﬁxation duration (the duration of the ﬁrst ﬁxation on a region when no
material to the right of the region had yet been ﬁxated), (iii) ﬁrst pass reading
time (the total ﬁxation time on a region the ﬁrst time it was entered, when no
material to the right of the region had yet been ﬁxated; also called gaze
duration for regions consisting of only one word), (iv) go-past time (the
accumulated time from when a reader ﬁrst ﬁxated on a region until their ﬁrst
ﬁxation to the right of the region; this measure includes any regressions the
reader made before moving forward past the word), (v) total reading time
(the summed time of all ﬁxations on a region), (vi) regressions out of a region
immediately after ﬁrst-pass reading, and (vii) regressions into a region. These
measures were computed for the regions of each sentence as delineated in
example 4. In addition, we deﬁned a go-past regression to have occurred from
region Y to region X if the reader had a ﬁrst-pass regression from region Y and
subsequently ﬁxated on region X before saccading past region Y. Fig. 2C shows
frequencies of go-past regression from the critical region to the preposition.

Statistical Analysis Method. We report most results using traditional by-
participants (F1) and by-items (F2) ANOVAs, with proportions for binary-
valued outcomes arcsine transformed before statistical analysis. Consistent
with standard practice, reading times ⬎4 SDs outside the mean for each
condition in each region were discarded as outliers. In cases where the
assumptions of ANOVA were badly violated (heavily imbalanced data and/or
binary responses with by-subject or by-item means close to 0 or 1), we used
mixed-effects models with crossed random effects of subject and item (38)
using the lme4 package in R (39). Complete details can be found in SI
Appendix.

Fig. 2. Means and standard errors of measures of processing difﬁculty associated with the critical word (e.g., tossed in sentences 2a and 3a; thrown in
sentences 2b and 3b) and overall sentence comprehension. (A) Proportion of trials with ﬁrst-pass regression from critical word. (B) Go-past time from ﬁrst
ﬁxation on critical word to ﬁrst ﬁxation beyond it. (C) Proportion of trials with ﬁxation on earlier preposition (at/toward) during go-past reading of critical
word. (D) Accuracy in comprehension-question answering. (E) First-pass time on critical word. In A, B, and D, interactions between preposition and critical-
word ambiguity are signiﬁcant (all ANOVA P < 0.05); in C, the interaction is P = 0.087. In E, main effect of critical-word ambiguity is signiﬁcant (ANOVA P <
0.05 by participants, P < 0.1 by items).

BIOCHEMISTRY
Correction for “Crystal structure analysis reveals Pseudomonas
PilY1 as an essential calcium-dependent regulator of bacterial
surface motility,” by Jillian Orans, Michael D. L. Johnson,
Kimberly A. Coggan, Justin R. Sperlazza, Ryan W. Heiniger,
Matthew C. Wolfgang, and Matthew R. Redinbo, which appeared
in issue 3, January 19, 2010, of Proc Natl Acad Sci USA
(107:1065–1070; ﬁrst published December 28, 2009; 10.1073/
pnas.0911616107).

The authors note that due to a printer’s error, on page 1065,
right column, ﬁrst full paragraph, seventh line, and page 1069,
right column, second paragraph, seventh line, the amino acids
6145–1163 should instead appear as 615–1163. This error does
not affect the conclusions of the article.

MICROBIOLOGY
Correction for “Intramolecular amide bonds stabilize pili on
the surface of bacilli,” by Jonathan M. Budzik, Catherine B.
Poor, Kym F. Faull, Julian P. Whitelegge, Chuan He, and Olaf
Schneewind, which appeared in issue 47, November 24, 2009,
of Proc Natl Acad Sci USA (106:19992–19997; ﬁrst published
November 10, 2009; 10.1073/pnas.0910887106).

The authors note that their manuscript was published without
a Protein Data Bank ID number to identify the crystal structure
of BcpA. The accession number for the structure is 3KPT.

RETRACTION

BIOCHEMISTRY
Retraction for “Triplex-forming oligonucleotide-orthophenan-
throline conjugates for efﬁcient targeted genome modiﬁcation,” by
Fabio Cannata, Erika Brunet, Loïc Perrouault, Victoria Roig,
Slimane Ait-Si-Ali, Ulysse Asseline, Jean-Paul Concordet, and
Carine Giovannangeli, which appeared in issue 28, July 15, 2008, of
Proc Natl Acad Sci USA (105:9576–9581; ﬁrst published July 3,
2008;10.1073/pnas.0710433105); the undersigned authors wish to
note the following, “During efforts to extend this work, we have
been unable to reproduce the mutation data shown in this paper
(Fig. 3C and Figs. S4 and S5 B and C). The ﬁrst author of the paper
admitted to an investigation committee having falsiﬁed the corre-
sponding sequence data. Consequently, the conclusion concerning
the induction of mutations by the orthophenanthroline-triplex
forming oligonucleotide conjugate (OP-19merTFO/LNA) in 10%
of cells is no longer supported by available evidence and the other
data concerning the cellular activity of OP-19merTFO/LNA con-
jugate should be reexamined. The undersigned authors therefore
retract the paper and the ﬁrst author approves this retraction. We
apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.”
