27.01.15

¡Dudley and Stephens came up with the idea of killing

5

27.01.15

Argumentation 
¡historical exposition

¡considered statements from ‘books of authority‘
¡(publications of famous jurists, barristers, judges,

philosophers…)

6

27.01.15

Argumentation
Bracton (ca.1210 – 1268)
¡‘in order to save your life you may

lawfully take away the life of another‘
but…
‘necessity in the ordinary sense - the
repelling of violence
(i.e. defending oneself)

7

Argumentation

Lord Hale (1609 — 1676)

¡‘If a man be […] in peril of death, and cannot

otherwise escape unless, to satisfy his
assailant´s fury, he will kill an innocent person then
present, the fear and actual force will
not acquit him of the crime and punishment of
murder […] for he ought rather to die
himself than kill an innocent…‘

8

27.01.15

Argumentation

Lord Bacon (1561 – 1626)

¡‘Necessity carries a privilege in itself. […] If a man

steal viands to satisfy his present
hunger, this is no felony nor larceny. So if divers be in
danger of drowning by the casting
away of some boat or barge, and one of them get to
some plank, or on the boat´s side to
keep himself above water, and another to save his life
thrust him from it, whereby he is
drowned, this is neither se defedendo (i.e. self-
defense) nor by misadventure, but
justifiable.‘

Findings
Coleridge´s Findings

¡‘But if Lord Bacon meant to lay down the broad

proposition that a man may save his life by
killing, if necessary, an innocent and unoffending
neighbour, it certainly is not law at the
present day.‘

10

27.01.15

Coleridge´s Findings

¡‘the killing of the boy was murder, unless the killing

can be justified by:

¡ some well-recognized excuse, or

¡ what has been called “necessity“‘

11

27.01.15

Coleridge´s Findings

¡‘war is full of instances in which it is a man´s duty not

to live, but to die […] these duties
impose on men the moral necessity, not of the
preservation, but of the sacrifice of their lives
for others… It is not correct, therefore, to say that
there is any absolute or unqualified
necessity to preserve one´s life.‘

¡‘A man has no right to declare temptation to be an

excuse.‘

12

27.01.15

Coleridge´s Findings

¡Coleridge found that neither necessity nor an

excuse was given…

13

27.01.15

Sentence
Coleridge´s Findings

¡Therefore, the sentencing passed was: ⟶

but…

 death,

¡the sentence was afterwards commuted by the Crown

to six months of
imprisonment…

14

27.01.15

Criticism on the verdict

¡Coleridge should not have expected ‘self-sacrifice‘

(i.e. starving) of the crew, but of the
weakest in order to save the live of the others

¡verdict obscures the fact that Parker´s death may

have saved the lives of three men. (Utility)

¡public opinion was strongly in

favour of Dudley and Stephens

15

Saint Christopher Case

¡In the 17th century seven Englishman embarked at a

voyage from Saint Christopher

¡Were blown away for 17 days and pulled lots on

whom had to sacrifice himself for the others

¡Trial for homicide 

Ø“washed away” because of “inevitable necessity”

16

Urugayan Air Force Flight 571

¡Chartered flight crashed in the Andes on 13th Oct.

1972

¡16 of 48 passengers survived and faced cold and

starvation

¡Chocolate bars, assorted snacks and a few bottles of

wine for all of them

¡Anthropophagy: After hesitation (necrotic

cannibalism) the remaining survivors fed on the dead
passengers

17

27.01.15

¡Two of the fittest survivors were able to climb the

mountain and found help on the other side at a hostel

¡Rescued by two helicopters 

¡Weren’t found guilty because the passengers

WERE dead BEFORE they ate them

18

27.01.15

“The Cannibal of Rotenburg“

¡Armin Meiwes and Bernd Brandes had a

rendezvouz…

¡Meiwes felt the need to ‘carry another man inside of

him‘, whereas Brandes had always
dreamed of getting eaten alive… a perfect match!

¡Meiwes slaughtered Brandes, put his flesh in the

freezer and consumed parts of his body
over months

19

27.01.15

¡tried for ‘fulfilling‘ the victims wish to die in spite of

Brandes´ state of insanity
(later declared by court)
¡GUILTY (8 1/2 years imprisonment), but the case was

revised…

¡later tried for murder and the desecration of a corpse

¡GUILTY (lifetime imprisonment)
