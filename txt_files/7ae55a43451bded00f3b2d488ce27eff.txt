Recap/addendum to last week

• An argument is a series of sentences that includes a set of 

premises and a conclusion.
– The set of premises may be empty!

• An argument is valid iff it is impossible for the conclusion to be 

false when the premises are all true.

• An argument is sound iff it is valid and all of its premises are true.

• Can an argument with no premises be valid and/or sound?
• Yes, if the conclusion is a tautology, i.e. necessarily true.

– These arguments are valid, because it is impossible for the conclusion to 

be false no matter what!

– They are also sound, because none of the premises are false (and 

therefore, all of them are true!)

Natural vs. Formal Languages

• Natural languages such as English and German have culturally 

evolved over long periods of time, and continue to do so. 
Their interpretation is context-sensitive and both their syntax 
and semantics are complex, and often give rise to ambiguities 
and vagueness. However, natural languages have a very high 
expressive power.
– Natural languages are the subject matter of linguistics.

• Formal languages have been purposefully designed during 
short periods of time. Their syntax and semantics is simple, 
defined precisely, and unambiguous. The interpretation of 
formal languages does not depend on context. However, 
formal languages have a very low expressive power.
– Formal languages are the subject matter of logic.

Syntax, Semantics and Pragmatics
• All languages, natural or formal, are characterized by three 

aspects (although only the first two are of interest to logicians).

• Syntax: fixes the vocabulary and grammar of the language.

– Syntax determines which signs the language consists of and how they may 
be combined. If you know the syntax of a language, you can decide which 
sequences of signs are well-formed expressions of the language.

• Semantics: fixes the meaning of expressions in the language.

– Semantics analyzes how the meaning of complex expressions is 

determined by the meaning of the simpler expressions contained therein. 
If you know the semantics of a language, you can understand well-formed 
expressions of the language and determine their meaning.

• Pragmatics: fixes the way linguistic expressions are used in a 

specific context.
