IntroductionIt is not uncommon for lay persons to erroneously believe that criminal inves-tigative analysis, commonly referred to as “criminal proﬁling,” is synonymous with forensic psychology, especially with the rise in popular-ity of television programs on proﬁling that in-corporate psychological concepts. Further con-fusion may occur because practitioners in both ﬁelds read the same research, interview the same criminals, attend the same seminars, develop professional relationships, and cite one anoth-er’s scholarship. However, what happens when forensic psychologists advance opinions about criminal matters based on the extrapolation of academic research on psychological concepts involving sexual homicide cases and reject the opinions of professional criminal proﬁlers who incorporate law enforcement analysis coupled with criminal evidentiary considerations into their work? Timothy Masters, who spent over 9 years in a Colorado prison for the murder of Peggy Hettrick, was released on January 22, 2008. Shortly thereafter, all homicide charges were dropped based on new DNA evidence pointing to other suspects. Masters, who always main-tained his innocence, was convicted largely on the testimony of forensic psychologist, Dr. Reid Meloy. His violent sketches and stories produced when he was an adolescent were used as evidence to arrest and convict him in 1999 of killing Peggy Hettrick in 1987, a convic-tion that was upheld by the Colorado Court of Appeals and the Colorado Supreme Court. Masters’s prosecution raises troubling questions, primarily because it pivoted on the controversial opinions of a board certiﬁed forensic psycholo-gist who analyzed Timothy’s sketches and con-Criminal Investigative Analysis, Forensic Psychology, and the Timothy Masters Casehis paper offers an analysis of the series of events that occurred when a homicide detective contacted an international expert in forensic psychology to assist in the arrest process and the prosecu-tion of a targeted sexual homicide suspect. The forensic psycholo-gist developed a psychological proﬁle of a killer using narrative and drawings made by the suspect to conclude that the suspect’s fantasy was the motive and behavioral preparation for the sexual murder, regardless of the fact that the forensic psychologist knew that there was no direct or physical evidence linking the suspect to the crime. In this article, the authors examine the case of Timothy Masters, who was arrested and convicted of sexual murder based on the testimony of a forensic psychologist while the opinion of a crimi-nal investigative analyst was ignored.
