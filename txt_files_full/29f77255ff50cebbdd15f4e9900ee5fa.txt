1. Introduction 
 

One  of  the  basic  questions  of  bilingual  research  is  to  what  extent  the  bilingual’s  two  phonetic 
systems  influence  each  other,  a  question  that  has  occupied  a  prominent  place  in  bilingual  research 
almost from the outset of the field (see, for example, Weinreich, 1953).  Recent studies in bilingual 
first  language  acquisition  (BFLA)  demonstrate  that,  at  least  in  simultaneous  bilingual  acquisition, 
infants exposed to two languages are developing what appear to be two phonetic/phonological systems 
from  the  beginning  (Johnson  and  Wilson,  2002;  Kehoe,  2002;  Bosch  and  Sebastian-Galles,  2001, 
Vihman, 2002), although their two systems may differ from monolinguals of either language (Mack, 
1989; Bosch, Costa, & Sebastian-Galles, 2000).   

In late bilingualism (i.e., when a second language is learned in adulthood), where one language 
system is already established when a second is learned, most likely a separate system for the second 
language  does not develop in the beginning.  In fact, most researchers agree, at least as initial stages of 
L2  learning,  adults  perceive  and  produce  both  native  (L1)  and  second  language  (L2)  vowels  and 
consonants (“sounds” for short) as instances of  similar L1 sounds.  In fact, it is only after extensive 
exposure to the second language that separate long-term memory representations (categories) for L2 
sounds are formed, if at all (Flege, Meador, & MacKay, 1999).   

The differences between these two types of bilingualism indicate that several factors most likely 
influence  both  the  extent  the  two  languages  influence  each  other  and  the  direction  of  the  influence 
(Flege, 1995; Piske, Flege, McKay, & Meador, 2002; Khattab, 2002).  The purpose of this study is to 
examine  how  two  factors,  the  amount  of  similarity  between  native  (L1)  and  second-language  (L2) 
sounds,  and  age  at  the  time  of  second  language  learning,  determine  how  the  L1  and  L2  phonetic 
systems interact both at initial and more advanced stages of L2 learning. 

The first factor, the amount of similarity between L1 and L2 sounds (or cross-language similarity),  
at least in late L2 learning, heavily determines how much the L1 influences the L2 (Flege, MacKay, 
and Munro, 1999; Best, 1995; Flege, 1995).  In particular, the more similar L2 sounds are to L1 sounds, 
the more likely the L1 will influence how L2 sounds are perceived and produced.  For example, Flege, 
Bohn,  &  Jang  (1997)  showed  that  learners  of  English  perceived  and  produced  English  vowels 
differently  depending  on  their  native  language.    In  addition,  Aoyama,  Flege,  Guion,  Yamada,  & 
Akhane-Yamada  (2003)  have  determined  that  Japanese  learners  of  English  identify  English  /r/  as 
being  more  similar  to  Japanese  //  than  this  Japanese  consonant  is  to  English  /l/.    These  same 
Japanese learners are more likely to produce English /r/ more accurately than English /l/.  These and 
many other studies indicate that cross-language similarity is an important factor in how much the L1 
and L2 interact in bilinguals (Best, 1995; Guion, Flege, Akhane-Yamada, & Pruitt, 2000). 

The second factor that may influence the organization of a bilinguals’ L1 and L2 phonetic systems 
is the learner’s age at the time of learning a second language.  In particular, in early bilinguals (i.e., 
those  that  learn  a  second  langauge  in  childhood),  the  native  language  seems  to  exert  less  of  an 
influence on the perception and production of the L2, suggesting that cross-language similarity  may 
play less of a role in early than in late bilinguals (Baker, Trofimovich, Mack, and Flege, 2001).  .  For 
example,  Flege,  MacKay  and  Meador  (1999)  found  that  early  Italian-English  bilinguals  were  more 
accurate in their perception and production of English vowels than were late Italian-English bilinguals,

Guion, Yamada, & Akhane-Yamada (2003) determined that early Japanese-English bilinguals over the 
course of 1 year were able to improve in the production of English /r/ and /l/ more than late bilinguals. 
These studies suggest that age at the time of learning a second language plays a significant role on how 
much of an influence the L1 has on the perception and production of the L2.  That is, the L1 exerts a 
greater degree of influence on the L2 of late than early bilinguals (Munro, Flege, & MacKay, 1996;  
Mack & Trofimovich, 2001; Piske, Flege, MacKay, & Meador, 2002). 

One hypothesis for these differences between early and late bilinguals is that, because their native 
language system is still developing, early bilinguals are less likely than late bilinguals to identify L2  
sounds with L1 sounds at the onset of L2 learning (Baker, Trofimovich, Mack, & Flege, 2002). This 
may  be  because,  as  L1  segment  categories  develop  through  childhood  (Ohde,  Haley,  &  McMahon, 
1996; Sharma, Kraus, McGee, & Nicol, 1997; Hazan and Barrett, 2001), they become more powerful 
attractors of L2 segments, exerting a greater influence on how the L2 is perceived and produced (Flege, 
1992; Walley & Flege, 1999).  Thus, adults, because their native system is fully developed, are more 
likely  than  children  to  equate  L2  sounds  with  L1  sounds.    If  this  is  indeed  the  case,  then  it  would 
explain why the two phonetic systems interact with each other less in early than late bilinguals.   The 
purpose of this study is to test this hypothesis.  

Thus  this  current  study  examines  whether,  because  children’s  L1  sounds  are  less  powerful 
attractors  of  L2  sounds,  early  bilinguals  are  less  likely  than  late  bilinguals  to  identify  L2  with  L1 
segments at the onset of L2 learning and (2) whether this likelihood translates into the two phonetic 
systems interacting with each other less in early than late bilinguals. In particular, it was predicted that 
(1) for both early and late bilinguals the degree of influence of the two languages on each other would 
be greater for similar than less similar sounds, (2) early bilinguals would be less affected by the cross-
language relationships in their production of English and Korean vowels than would late bilinguals in 
initial stages of L2 learning, and (3) in later stages of L2 learning early bilinguals would be more likely 
than late bilinguals to keep their two languages  separate.  To test these hypotheses, two experiments 
were conducted.  In Experiment 1, early and late native Korean speakers with little English experience 
judged and rated the similarity between English and Korean vowels.  In Experiment 2, beginning early 
and  late  native  Korean  learners  of  English,  as  well  as  more  advanced  early  and  late  bilinguals 
produced  six  Korean  and  eight  English  vowels  in  CVC  word  contexts.  The  influence  of  the  two 
languages  on  each  other  was  investigated  by  comparing  whether  bilinguals  were  able  to  produce 
differences between English and Korean vowels.    

 

2. Experiment 1:  cross-language identification 
 

The  purpose  of  Experiment  1  was  to  determine  whether  children  are  less  likely  than  adults  to 
identify L2 sounds as L1 sounds, which in turn might explain why the L1 and L2 phonetic systems of 
children  and  adults  influence  each  other  differently.    To  explore  this  hypothesis,  20  native  Korean 
speakers (10 children and 10 adults) were asked to judge the similarity between English vowels and 
Korean vowels in a cross-language perceptual identification task.  

 

2.1 Participants 
 

The participants of this experiment were 10 child (mean age: 8.8; range: 7-9 years) and 10 adult 
(mean  age:  22.7;  range:  20-23  years)  native  Korean  speakers  who  had  resided  in  the  U.S.  for  on 
average less than 1 year.  The participants were recruited based on their limited English ability, with 
the goal that both the children and adults would have as similar English experience to each other as 
possible.    The  participants  completed  a  language  background  questionnaire  that  determined  their 
English  language  experience.    Answers  to  this  language  background  questionnaire  revealed  that  the 
children  had,  on  average,  2.3  months  in  the  United  States  (range:    2-16  months)  and  none  had 
experience with English previously, whereas the adults had resided in the United States for 4.3 months 
(range:  1-18 months) and had limited exposure to native English speakers before coming to the United 
States.  Participants also rated their ability to speak, comprehend, read, and write English on a 10-point 
Likert scale (where “1” = “I don’t know any English” and “10” = “I am a native speaker of English).  

• 164 •

The  adults  rated  their  ability  to  use  English  on  average  3.2  and  the  children  rated  their  ability  on 
average 4.2.  Participants (or their parents) also estimated the amount of time they spoke English daily.  
Adult participants spoke English on average 44% of the time and children on average 32% of the time.  
Statistical analyses indicated that the children and adults did not differ significantly from each other on 
any  of  these  demographic  variables.  The  answers  on  this  language  background  questionnaire 
confirmed that the participants had limited English ability.   

In order to examine how the participants judged the similarity between English and Korean vowels, 8 
were selected because pairs of these vowels (English /i/-//, /u/-//, /æ/-//, //-//) are often confused by 
Korean learners of English) and they are difficult to learn (Flege, Bohn, & Jang, 1997). These English 
vowels were placed in 3 phonetic contexts in English monosyllabic CVC words (Table 1).

The English words were recorded by 3 male monolingual English speakers (average age:  24) who 
were  untrained  in  second  language  acquisition,  linguistics,  or  phonetics.    The  stimulus  words  were 
recorded using a Shure unidimensional head-mounted microphone (model: SM10A) and Sony DAT 
tape recorder (model: TCD-D8).  The monolingual speakers produced each word in a carrier phrase “I 
say ----- for you” in random order.  Each word token was subsequently excised from the carrier phrase 
and the best token of each word (based on its clarity) was selected for inclusion in the experiment.  The 
resulting 144 words (24 stimulus words × 3 speakers x 2 repetitions) were digitized at 16 kHz, ramped 
off during the first and last 15 msec to eliminate audible clicks, and normalized for peak intensity and 
perceived loudness.   
 
2.3 Procedure 
 

In  this  experiment,  participants  were  tested  individually  in  a  quiet  room  and  the  stimuli  were 
presented  using  presentation  software  (Smith,  1997).    Over  headphones,  the  participants  heard  each 
token twice in each trial.  The first time the participants heard the English token (cross-language vowel 
identification),  participants  selected  one  of  the  10  vowels  of  standard  Korean  (represented 
orthographically in Hangul characters on a computer monitor) to which the English vowel in the token 
was most similar. The second time the participants heard the same English token (similarity-ratings), 
they rated the degree of similarity between the English vowel they heard and the Korean vowel they 
chose  on  a  7-point  scale.    On  this  scale  a  “1”  indicated  that  the  vowels  across  the  two  languages 
“sounded very dissimilar” and a “7” indicated that they “sounded very similar.”  Importantly, the task 
required the participants to choose one of the Korean vowels and to guess if unsure.  Participants had 
an unlimited time to choose the response alternative, but were unable to change their choice once it 
was made. 
 
2.4 Results 
 

The  vowel-identification  responses  were  analyzed  by  determining  how  many  times  each 
participant classified each English vowel with its modal (most frequent) Korean response alternative.   
For example, the Korean vowel chosen most in response to tokens of English /i/ (and therefore was 
the  modal  response  alternative)  was  Korean  /i/.    Similarity-rating  responses  were  analyzed  by 
computing  a  participant’s  mean  similarity  rating between  each  English  vowel  and  its  modal  Korean 
response alternative.  

The  children  and  adults  selected  the  same  Korean  vowel  as  the  primary  (modal)  response 

• 165 •

 

alternative in their classification of each English vowel.  That is, for each English vowel, both children 
and adults chose one Korean vowel that they perceived as being most similar to the English vowel.  
The modal responses alternatives for each English vowel, as well as the percent of the time each was  
chosen, were as follows for both the adult [A] and child [C] groups: English //—Korean /a/ (A: .73, 
C: .66); English //—Korean // (A: .51, C: .42); English /i/—Korean /i/ (A: .92, C: .79); English 
//—Korean /i/ (A: .68, C: .58); English /u/—Korean /u/ (A: .83, C: .61); English //—Korean /u/ 
(A: .61, C: .39); English /æ/—Korean // (A: .67, C: .44); English //—Korean // (A: .57, C: .39).  

 
 
 
          
      
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1:  Cross-language relationships between English and Korean vowels 
 
In addition, the English (E) and Korean (K) vowels fell into 3 types of cross-language perceptual 
relationships.  The first type consisted of those vowels across the two languages that were perceived on 
a one-to-one basis.  That is, one English vowel was identified with one Korean vowel, such as Eng 
//–Kor /a/; Eng //–Kor //.  These vowels were very similar across the two languages.  The second 
type consisted of those vowels that were perceived on a two-to-two basis.  In this case, two English 
vowels  were  identified  with  two  Korean  vowels:  E  /æ/,  //–K  //,  /e/.    Because  two  vowels  were 
chosen an almost equal number of times for both these English vowels, these vowels were considered 
highly dissimilar from a single Korean vowel.  Finally, the third type were vowels that were perceived 
on a two-to-one basis.  That is, two English vowels were identified with one Korean vowel: E /i/, //–
K /i/, E /u/, //–K /u/.  These vowel-pairs were highly confusable across the two languages,  and one 
of the English vowels was perceived as being highly and one less similar to the same Korean vowel.   

To determine whether children and adults differ in their judgments of similarity between L1 and 
L2 sounds, a two-way (group × vowel) ANOVA comparing the groups’ frequency of identification of 
each English vowel with its modal Korean response alternative was performed. This analysis yielded a 
significant  main  effect  for  group  [F(1,58)=7.72,  p=.007]  and  vowel  [F(7,406)=28.79,  p=.001]  and  a 
significant  group  ×  vowel  interaction  [F(7,406)=2.45,  p=.018].  Further  tests  of  simple  main  effects 
demonstrated  that  the  children  were  less  likely  than  the  adults  to  choose  the  modal  Korean  vowel 
response alternatives for 5 of the 8 English vowels—English /æ/, //, /i/, //, and /u/ (Bonferroni tests 
(t-tests  with  α  adjusted  for  number  of  pairwise  comparisons)  indicated  that  these  comparisons  were 
significant (p<.05).  A two-way (group x vowel) ANOVA was also performed on the cross-language 
similarity ratings.  This analysis yielded a significant main effect for vowel [F(7,105)=3.08, p=.005] 
and  a  significant  group  ×  vowel  interaction  [F(7,105)=3.14,  p=.005].    Further  tests  of  main  effects 
demonstrated that the children rated the similarity between English //, //, // and Korean /a/, //, //, 
respectively,  lower  than  did  the  adults  (p<.05).  In  summary,  these  results  indicate  that  the  children 
were less likely than the adults to  identify English vowels as instances of Korean vowels.  Moreover, 
children  rated  the  similarity  between  English  and  Korean  vowels  lower  than  did  the  adults.    This 
tendency reached significance for all English vowels except English //.  These findings suggest that 
children are less likely than adults to identify English vowels with Korean vowels.  Importantly, these 
differences were maintained across all the cross-language vowel types identified above. 

The findings that children were less likely to identify English vowels with Korean vowels, as well 
as the grouping of cross-language vowel pairs into these three types of relationships will provide the 
basis  for  examining  the  extent  to  which  the  L1-L2  interaction  is  determined  by  the  perceptual 
similarity between these English and Korean vowels.

2.5 Discussion 
 

The results of experiment 1 suggest that age may influence how the L1-L2 phonetic systems are 
organized.  In particular, the native Korean children were less likely to identify English (L2) vowels 
with  Korean  (L1)  sounds.    These  findings  may  provide  at  least  one  reason  why  the  L1  and  L2 
influence each other differently in early than in late bilinguals.   The results of this study also suggest 
that  the  cross-language  similarity  between  L1  and  L2  sounds  also  differs  depending  on  the  L1-L2 
vowel  pairs.    That  is,  both  the  children  and  adults  identified  three  different  types  of  cross-language 
relationships  between  English  and  Korean  vowels.    In  particular,  some  of  the  English  vowels  were 
judged more similar to their modal Korean vowel response alternative than were others. These findings 
provide the basis for testing the extent to which age and cross-language similarity influence how much 
the L1 and L2 influence each other. 
 
3. Experiment 2:  comparisons of English and Korean vowels 

 

The  purpose  of  Experiment  2  was  to  determine  whether  and  how  cross-language  similarity  (as 
determined in Experiment 1) influences how early and late bilinguals’ two languages influence each 
other.  In  particular,  three  hypotheses  were  proposed.    First,  it  was  hypothesized  that  less  similar 
vowels across English and Korean would be more likely to be produced differently from each other 
than  those  that  were  judged  as  being  more  similar  to  each  other.    Second,  based  on  the  results  of 
Experiment 1, it was also hypothesized that late bilinguals’ production of English and Korean vowels 
would  depend  more  than  early  bilinguals’  production  upon  the  perceived  cross-language  similarity 
between these vowels.  Moreover, it was hypothesized that, with extensive experience with English, 
early  Korean-English  bilinguals  would  be  more  likely  than  late  bilinguals  to  separate  their  two 
languages,  regardless  of  cross-language  similarity.    To  test  these  three  hypotheses,  early  and  late 
Korean-English bilinguals with either 1 year or 7 years of English experience were asked to produce 
24 English vowels and 14 Korean vowels in a picture-naming task.  

 

3.1 Participants 
 

Forty native Korean speakers participated in Experiment 2.  These forty participants were divided 
into  four  groups  depending  on  their  age  at  the  time  of  exposure  to  English  and  the  amount  of 
experience they had had with English (see Table 2).  The first two groups, the “Late+1” and “Early+1”  
groups  (where  the  "+1"  indicates  an  average  of  1  year  of  U.S.  Residence),  were  recruited  based  on 
their similarity to those native Korean speakers who participated in Experiment 1.  That is, both groups 
had  been  exposed  to  English  in  the  U.S.  for  about  1  year  (mean:  Late+1,  0.6;  Early+1,  0.8),  but 
differed  in  their  age  of  English  acquisition:    The  Late+1  group  had  arrived  in  the  United  States  on 
average at 24.3 years old (range: 21-25) and the Early+1 group had arrived on average at 9.9 years old 
(range:  7-13).  The two groups also rated their ability to read, speak, write and comprehend English on 
a scale from 1 (“I don’t know any English”) to 10 (“I am a native speaker of English”).  The Late+1 
group rated their English ability on this scale on average 6.1 and the Early+1 group rated their ability 
on average 4.5.  The two groups also estimated their amount of daily Korean use as on average 56% of 
the  time.    Based  on  these  demographic  characteristics,  both  the  Early+1  and  Late+1  groups  were 
considered to be beginning English speakers. 

Two  other  groups  were  also  included  in  the  experiment  to  test  the  hypothesis  that  more 
experienced early bilinguals would be more likely than late bilinguals to produce differences between 
similar English and Korean vowels (i.e., keep their two languages separate).  The third group in this 
study, the “Late+7” group (where the "+7" indicates an average of 7 years of U.S. residence) had been 
exposed to English in the U.S. as adults (mean age of exposure: 22.6; range: 15-30).   The fourth group, 
the “Early+7” group had been exposed to English in the U.S. as children (mean age of exposure: 8,8; 
range:    7-13).    These  two  groups  had  considerably  more  experience  with  English  than  the  first  two 
groups (mean amount of exposure:  Late+7, 6.9; Early+7, 8.0) but they differed based on their age of 

• 167 •

arrival in the U.S.   In addition, the two groups rated their English ability significantly higher than the 
Late+1 and Early+1 groups (Late+1, 6.7; Early+7, 7.8), but used Korean daily equally as often as did 
the  less  experienced  groups  (Late+1,  55%;  Early+7,  40%).    Based  on  these  demographic 
characteristics, the Late+7 and Early+7 groups were considered to be advanced English speakers.

3.2 Stimuli 
 

The stimuli for this experiment consisted of the same 8 English vowels (/i/, //, //, /æ/, /u/, //, 
//, /a/) used in Experiment 1 (see Table 3).  The vowels were located in 24 monosyllabic words that 
differed slightly from the words used in Experiment 1.  The words were changed slightly from those in 
Experiment  1  to  make  them  representative  of  picturable  concrete  images,  or  more  suitable  for  the 
picture-naming task.  The words were elicited from a female native English speaker (age:  31) using 
the same procedures as those used to elicit the stimuli for Experiment 1.

In addition, the stimuli for this experiment also consisted of 7 Korean vowels (/i/, //, //, /e/, /u/,

English  equivalents;  English translations  are  listed below each word  in parentheses).  These  Korean 
vowels were chosen because, of the 10 Korean vowels in Experiment 1, they were perceived to be the 
most similar to English vowels.  The words were elicited from a female native Korean speaker (age: 
26) using the same procedures as those used to elicit the stimuli for Experiment 1.

3.3. Procedure 
 

To elicit the 24 English and 14 Korean words, participants were asked to participate in a  picture- 
naming task.  In particular, participants were tested individually in a quiet room or sound-attenuated 
booth.  Participants were randomly assigned to either produce all the Korean or all the English words 
first.    The  words  were  randomly  presented  three  times  to  the  participants.    The  first  time  the 
participants saw the pictures representing each of the Korean or English words, they heard the name of 
the picture over the computer’s loudspeakers and were asked to repeat the word.  The second and third

times they saw the pictures they were asked to remember the name of the picture and to repeat it as 
soon as they saw the picture.  If they were unable to remember the name of the picture, they heard the 
name over the loudspeakers and then repeated the word.  By the third time they saw the picture, most 
participants  were  able  to  repeat  the  name  of  the  picture  without  a  prompt.    This  allowed  for 
spontaneous productions of the words.  Participants were recorded using a Shure unidimensional head-
mounted microphone (model: SM10A) and Sony DAT tape recorder (model: TCD-D8).   
 
3.4 Acoustic measurements 
 

Each  participant’s  third  production  of  each  of  the  English  and  Korean  words  were  used  for  the 
analysis.    In  most  cases,  these  productions  were  spontaneously  produced.    The  words  were  excised 
from the speech stream and were submitted to an acoustic analysis.  The analysis included 960 English 
and 560 Korean word productions (40 native Korean participants x 14 Korean and 24 English words). 
Acoustic  analyses  of  the  bilinguals’  English  and  Korean  words  were  performed  to  obtain  an 
accurate measure of the interaction between the two languages. The English and Korean vowels were 
analyzed by measuring the first three vowel formants (F0, F1, F2) in two locations in each token, onset 
of  vowel  and  vowel  midpoint,  although  only  the  measurements  at  vowel  midpoint  were  used  in  the 
analysis. The vowel formants were measured using Bliss (Brown Linguistics Speech Software, Mertus, 
2001) and were measured both by hand and by using LPC measurements. 

These  measurements  were  then  converted  to  Bark  scale  (B)  to  normalize  for  gender  and  age 
differences in vowel production (Syrdal & Gopal, 1986).  The following formula was used to convert 
F0 values to Bark scale:  B0 = 26.81/(1+(1960/F0))-.0.53.  The same formula was used to compute B1 
and B2, where F1 and F2, respectively, were substituted for F0 in the preceding formula.  Next, the 
formant  frequencies  were  transformed  to  two  values:  B1-B0  and  B2-B1.    B1-B0  is  an  estimate  of 
vowel  position  in  the  high-low  dimension,  where  lower  numbers  represent  low  vowels  and  high 
numbers represent high vowels.  B2-B1 is an estimate of vowel position in the front-back dimension, 
where  lower  values  represent  back  vowels  and  higher  values  represent  front  vowels.  Thus,  the 
independent variables in the analysis were the participants' B1-B0 and B2-B1 measurements of each 
Korean and English words’ vowel formant frequencies.   

 

3.5 Results 
 

The  acoustic  measurements  were  submitted  to  statistical  analysis  in  order  to  explore  the  three 
hypotheses  of  this  study.    First,  the  four  groups’  B1-B0  (vowel  height)  values  were  submitted  to  a 
three-way  (group  x  vowel  x  language)  ANOVA  which  yielded  a  significant  main  effect  for  group, 
vowel and language (all F’s>37.21; p<.0001).  In addition significant group x vowel, vowel x language, 
and group x language interactions were also obtained (all F’s>2.3; p<.001).  A similar analysis of the 
four groups’ B2-B1 (vowel frontedness) values also revealed a significant main effect for group, vowel, 
and language (all F’s>36.66; p<.001) and significant group x vowel, group x language, and vowel x 
language interactions (all F’s>14.07; p<.001).  Further analyses explored how the inexperienced early 
and  late  Korean-English  bilinguals’  productions  of  English  and  Korean  vowels  differed  from  each 
other and from the more experienced bilinguals. 
 
3.5.1 Hypothesis 1 
 

First  examined  in  the  analyses  was  the  hypothesis  that  more  similar  vowels  across  the  two 
languages  would  influence  each  other  more  than  would  vowels  that  are  less  similar  across  the  two 
languages. In particular, it was hypothesized that bilinguals should be less likely to produce differences 
between vowel pairs perceived on a one-to-one basis across the two languages (English-Korean vowel 
pairs    that  were  highly  similar  to  each other)    than  those  that  were perceived on  a  two-to-two basis 
(English-Korean vowel pairs that were relatively dissimilar to each other or those that were perceived 
on a two-to-one basis (English-Korean vowel pair where two English vowels were perceived as nearly 
equally similar to a single Korean vowel). A second hypothesis, based on the results of Experiment 1, 
was  that  the  inexperienced  early  bilinguals  (Early+1  group)  would  be  less  affected  by  the  cross-

• 169 •

language relationships in their production of English and Korean vowels than would the inexperienced 
late  bilinguals  (Late+1  group).    If  this  is  indeed  the  case,  it  would  suggest  at  least  one  reason  for 
differences between early and late bilinguals. 

To  examine  these  hypotheses,  B1-B0  (vowel  height)  and  B2-B1  (front/back)  values  of  the 
participants'  production  of  English  vowels  and  their  modal  Korean  response  alternatives  (as 
determined  by  Experiment  1)  were  compared  to  each  other  to  determine  whether  the  bilinguals 
produced  the  two  vowels  differently.    For  example,  the  Korean  vowel  that  was  perceived  (i.e., 
identified) as most similar to English /i/ was Korean /i/.  Therefore, statistical analyses determined 
whether the participants produced Korean /i/ and English /i/ differently from each other. Table 5 lists 
all the English vowels, their modal Korean vowel response alternatives and their B1-B0, B2-B1 values. 
Thus,  the  Early+1  groups'  B1-B0  values  (vowel  height)  for  both  English  and  Korean  were 
submitted to a two-way (language x vowel pair) ANOVA, which yielded a significant main effect for 
vowel  and  group,  and  a  significant  group  x  vowel  interaction  (all  F’s>4.89;  p<.0001).  A  similar 
analysis  examining  the  group’s  B2-B1  values  (vowel  front/backedness)  yielded  a  significant  main 
effect for vowel, group, and a significant group x vowel interaction (all F’s>17.62; p<.0001).  Next, a 
similar analysis of the B2-B1 and B1-B0 values for the Late+1 group was conducted.  These analyses 
for the Early+1 groups’ B1-B0 values (vowel height) yielded a significant main effect group, vowel 
and a significant group x vowel interaction (all F’s>3.34; p<.001).  Similarly for the group’s B2-B1 
(vowel front/backedness) values a significant main effect for vowel and group and a group x vowel 
interaction were obtained (all F’s>6.76; p<.0001).

Further exploration of the main effects revealed that the neither of the two groups (Early+1 and 
Late+1)  produced  significant  differences  between  any  of  the  vowel  pairs  perceived  on  a  one-to-one 
basis,  such  as  English  /i/  and  Korean  /i/,  or  those  cross-language  vowel  pairs  that  were  the  most 
similar to each other across the two languages (Bonferroni adjustment, p<.01).  (See Table 5, where 
the B1-B0 and B2-B1 values for both the Korean and English vowels are listed for both the Early+1 
and Late+1 groups—where significant differences in the production of the English and Korean vowels 
occur, the values are listed in bold.)  In contrast, both groups produced significant differences between 
those English-Korean vowel pairs perceived on a two-to-two basis, such as English /æ/ and Korean //, 
those  cross-language  vowel  pairs  across  the  two  languages  that  were  least  similar  to  each  other; 
(Bonferroni  adjustment,  p<.01).    These  two  findings  confirmed  the  first  hypothesis  that  less  similar 
vowels  across  the  two  languages  would  be  more  likely  to  be  produced  with  significant  differences 
from each other than those that are more similar across the two languages, regardless of the age of L2 
acquisition.    (In  all  analyses,  significance  was  reported  only  when  both  the  B1-B0  and  the  B2-B0 
analyses were p<.01.)

3.5.2 Hypothesis 2 
 

Moreover,  analyses  of  those  vowels  that  are  perceived  on  a  two-to-one  basis  across  the  two 
languages demonstrated that the Early+1 group produced a difference between the confusable vowels 
English // and Korean /i/ (Bonferrroni adjustment, p<.01) but the Late+1 group did not.  Because the 
younger learners were able to produce differences between highly confusable vowels across the two 
languages, this finding seems to suggest that the younger L2 learners are less influenced by the cross-
language similarity of the two languages than are the older L2 learners.  These findings thus support 
the second hypothesis of this study.    

 

3.5.3 Hypothesis 3 
 

The final hypothesis examined in this study was that, with more experience, early bilinguals’ two 
languages should interact with each other less than those of late bilinguals.  This hypothesis was first 
examined by completing similar analyses to those performed on the inexperienced bilinguals’ English 
and Korean vowel production.  That is, the Early+7 and Late+7 groups’ formant frequency values for 
similar  English  and  Korean  vowels  were  submitted  to  statistical  analyses  to  determine  if  they  were 
able to produce differences between them. In particular, a two-way (language x vowel pair) ANOVA 
on the Early+7 groups’ B1-B0 values (vowel height) yielded a significant main effect for vowel and 
group  and  a  significant  group  x  vowel  interaction  (all  F’s>6.01;  p<.0001).    For  the  B2-B1  values 
(vowel front/backedness) similar results were obtained (all F’s>6.43; p<.0001).  Analyses examining 
the production of English and Korean vowels by the Late+7 group for the B1-B0 values (vowel height) 
also  revealed  a  significant  main  effect  for  vowel  and  group  (all  F’s>21.79),  but  no  group  x  vowel 
interaction (F=1.10; p=.36).  For the B2-B1 values (vowel front/backedness), a significant main effect 
for group and vowel and a significant group x vowel interaction were obtained (all F’s>3.47; p<.001).

Further  tests  of  main  effects  for  vowel  revealed  that,  like  the  Late+1  and  Early+1  groups,  the 
Late+7  and  Early+7  groups  did  not  differ  in  their  production  of  highly  similar  English  and  Korean 
vowel pairs, such as English /i/ and Korean /i/, or those perceived on a one-to-one basis across the 
two languages (Bonferroni adjustment, p<.01).  (See Table 6, where the B1-B0 and B2-B1 values for 
both  the  Korean  and  English  vowels  are  listed  for  both  the  Early+7  and  Late+7  groups—when 
significant differences in the production of the English and Korean vowels occur, the values are listed 
in bold.)  Similarly, like the Early+1 and Late+1 groups, the Early+7 and Late+7 groups did produce 
differences between highly dissimilar English and Korean vowel pairs, such as English /æ/ and Korean 
// , or those perceived on a two-to-two basis across the two languages (Bonferroni adjustment, p<.01).   

Interestingly, the Early+7 group also produced differences between highly confusable English and 
Korean vowel pairs, such as English // and Korean /i/, as did the Early+1 group.  The Early+7 group 
also  produced  differences  between  one  English-Korean  vowel  pair  that  the  Early+1  group  did  not, 

• 171 •

English /u/ and Korean /u/.   In contrast, the Late+7 group, as did the Late+1 group, did not produce 
any  differences  between  either  of  the  English-Korean  vowel  pairs  perceived  on  a  two-to-one  basis 
across  the  two  languages.    Such  findings  suggest  that  early  bilinguals  are  more  likely  than  late 
bilinguals, with more experience, to separate their two language systems.  That is, the native language 
of the early bilinguals exerted less of an effect on early than on late bilinguals.  These findings support 
the hypothesis that early bilinguals two languages systems interact with each other less than do those 
of  late  bilinguals.    One  of  the  reasons  why  these  differences  occur,  based  on  the  findings  of 
Experiment 1, is that younger bilinguals are less likely than older bilinguals to identify L2 sounds with 
L1 sounds in the initial stages of L2 learning.   

 

3.6 Discussion 
 

Acoustic analyses of early and late bilinguals’ production of L1 and L2 segments confirmed the 
hypotheses proposed at the onset of this experiment.  Examination of similar vowel pairs across the 
two  languages  confirmed  the  first  hypothesis  that  bilinguals  would  be  more  likely  to  produce 
differences between very dissimilar than between very similar vowel pairs across the two languages, 
regardless of their age of L2 acquisition.   Second, as was hypothesized, early bilinguals were more 
likely than late bilinguals to produce differences between English and Korean vowels, at least for those 
vowel pairs that were confusable across the two languages.   

Finally, as was hypothesized, in later stages of L2 learning, early bilinguals were more likely than 
late bilinguals to maintain a distinction between their native and second language.  In particular, the 
Late+1 and Late+7 groups did not differ in their ability to produce differences between English and 
Korean  vowels,  even  though  the  Late+7  group  had  considerable  more  experience  with  the  second 
language than did the Late+1 group.  In contrast, the Early+1 and Early+7 did differ in their ability to 
produce  differences  between  English  and  Korean  vowels.    The  Early+7  group  was  able  to  produce 
differences between one more Korean-English vowel pair than was the Early+1 group.  This difference 
between  early  and  late  bilinguals  may  have  been  because  early  bilinguals’  L1  categories  are  still 
developing as they learn the second language.  Thus, children are more likely than adult L2 learners to 
keep their two languages separate. 

 

4. General discussion 

 

This  study  examined  the  influence  of  cross-language  similarity  and  age  at  the  time  of  L2 
acquisition on the organization of a bilinguals’ L1 and L2 phonetic systems.  In particular, this study 
tested three hypotheses.   The first hypothesis was that more similar vowels across the two languages 
would be more likely to influence each other than those that are less similar across the two languages. 
The findings of  this  study  indicated  that  this  hypothesis was upheld:  Both  early  and  late  bilinguals 
were more likely to produce differences between English and Korean vowel pairs that were relatively 
dissimilar from each other more than those that were relatively similar to each other.  In fact, the extent 
to which L1 and L2 segments interacted depended on how perceptually similar those segments were.   
The second hypothesis of this study was that, because early bilinguals are initially less likely than 
late  bilinguals  to  associate  L2  sounds  with  L1  sounds,  they  would  also  be  more  likely  to  maintain 
differences between L1 and L2 vowels even at initial stages of L2 learning.  This hypothesis was also 
upheld  by  the  results  of  this  study:    Even  at  beginning  stages  of  L2  learning,  early  bilinguals  were 
more likely than late bilinguals to produce differences between English and Korean vowels, especially 
those that were the most confusable across the two languages.  Such findings suggest that, as occurs in 
bilingual first-language acquisition, younger L2 learners have two phonetic systems even at the onset 
of learning a second language.   

The  final  hypothesis  of  this  study  was  that,  because  they  are  less  likely  initially  to  identify  L2 
sounds with L1 sounds, with more L2 experience, younger L2 learners would be more likely than older 
L2 learners to keep their two languages separate.  This hypothesis was also supported by this study.  
Early  bilinguals  were  able  to  produce  differences  between  highly  confusable  English  and  Korean 
vowel pairs after 7 years of L2 experience. In contrast, late bilinguals with a similar amount of English 
experience  were  not  able  to  do  so.  These  findings  suggest  that  the  native  language  exerts  a  lesser 

• 172 •

degree on the second language for early than for late bilinguals, or that the early learners were better 
able to separate at least some L2 sounds from L1 sounds. 

  These  findings  suggest  that  late  bilinguals  maintain  only  one  phonetic  system  (L1)  even  after 
several years of being exposed to and speaking the L2.  In contrast, these findings seem to suggest that 
early  bilinguals  maintain  two  separate  phonetic  systems,  and  do  so  from  the  onset  of  L2  learning.  
Thus, early bilinguals, even those who learn their L2 in later childhood (like the participants in this 
study)  learn  sounds  more  similarly  to  simultaneous  bilinguals  than  to  adult  L2  learners.      Further 
analyses will reveal the extent to which these early and late bilinguals are able to maintain separate 
categories (long-term memory representations) for L1 and L2 sounds and the nature of these categories, 
providing  greater  insight  in  how  cross-language  similarity  and  age  of  L2  acquisition  influence  the 
organization of a bilinguals’ two phonetic system.   In addition, further analyses will explore the nature 
of  the  relationship  between  highly  similar  vowels  across  the  two  languages,  or  those  sounds  which 
neither the early nor the late bilinguals were able to separate across the two languages. 

In summary, the findings of this study shed light on why there are differences between the two 
phonetic  systems  of  early  and  late  bilinguals.  In  particular,  because  the  L1  categories  are  still 
developing when the second language is learned, early bilinguals develop a separate system for native- 
and second-language sounds.  In contrast, adults, because their native-language system is completely 
developed by the time they learn a second language, develop categories that resemble a unidirectional 
influence from the L1 to the L2.  In short, these findings demonstrate that the state of the bilinguals’ 
native language system at the time of second-language learning and the amount of similarity between 
native-  and  second-language  segments  may  explain  why  there  are  differences  in  how  the  two 
languages interact in early versus late bilinguals.
