Deﬁnitions

Deﬁnition
A ﬁnite Lpred interpretation for a set of Lpred sentences Φ1, ..., Φn
consists of the following:

A universe: A ﬁnite, non-empty set of objects.

An assignment of exactly one object from the universe to each one of
the names occurring in Φ1, ..., Φn.
An assignment of a (possibly empty) set of n-tuples of objects from
the universe to each n-place predicate occurring in Φ1, ..., Φn.
An assignment of truth-values to each of the sentence letters in
Φ1, ..., Φn.

Now we can decide whether our interpretation satisﬁes our set of
formulas - and it does. No surprise there because we constructed it in
that way. We were really ”searching” for a model.

Deﬁnitions

Deﬁnition
An expansion of a universal wﬀ relative to a universe of n elements
consists of n conjuncts where the ith conjunct is an instance of the formula
with the name of the ith element in the universe as the instantial name.

Deﬁnition
An expansion of an existential wﬀ relative to a universe of n elements
consists of n disjuncts where the ith disjunct is an instance of the formula
with the name of the ith element in the universe as the instantial name.

In the universe {a, b, c}, the expansion of ∀x(Fx → Gx) is
(Fa → Ga) ∧ (Fb → Gb) ∧ (Fc → Gc).
The expansion of ∃x(Fx ∧ Gx) in the universe {a,b,...} is
(Fa ∧ Ga) ∨ (Fb ∧ Gb) ∨ ...

Method

Quantiﬁed sentences: Completely expand all universal and existential wﬀs.
Then assign truth values for the resulting quantiﬁer-free wﬀs. The truth
value of a quantiﬁed sentence is the truth value of its expansion in I.

Sentence letters: Sentence letters have the truth values directly assigned
to them in the interpretation I.

Predicates: Sentences of the form Φα1...αn, where Φ is an n-place
predicate and α1, ..., αn are names, are true in I iﬀ < α1, ..., αn > is in the
extension of Φ in I. Particularly, formulas of the form Φα, where Φ is an
one-place predicate and α is a name, are true in I iﬀ α is in the extension of
Φ in I.

Connectives: The truth values for sentences containing connectives are
determined according to the usual truth-functional rules for the connectives.

Identity statements: Sentences of the form α = β, where α and β are
names, are true in I iﬀ α and β have the same extension in I, i.e. refer to the
same object.

Deﬁnition
A model of an Lpred sentence Φ is an interpretation under which Φ is true.

Deﬁnition

Φ is false.

This gets out of hand really fast.
We have |U |#of ∃,∀ many disjunctive/conjunctive terms.
So like the truth table this is not feasible for bigger universes/ many
quantiﬁers. We need a diﬀerent method.

Method

Just like in Lprop we can use a similar method to semantically analyze
wﬀ’s. But we cannot simply decompose any given wﬀ’s and ﬁnd out
whether it’s tautologous because even if all the branches stay open, it still
doesn’t mean that there can’t be a counter-model. Do you remember the
trick we used in Lprop?

S(v) is any open formula containing the free variable v, and S(α/v ) is a wﬀ we
