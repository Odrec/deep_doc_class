The constitution of a European
immigration policy domain: a
political sociology approach
Virginie Guiraudon1*

ABSTRACT At the 1999 Tampere summit, EU member states committed
themselves to developing a comprehensive immigration and asylum policy. Although
directives harmonizing border controls or anti-discrimination instruments have
been adopted, it remains an incomplete and complex European policy area. This
article seeks to explain the timing, form and content of this new domain. It
combines the insights of March and Olsen’s ‘garbage can’ model with a sociological
approach that emphasizes power competition among actors in the same ﬁeld.
Diverse actors have seized upon EU opportunities. Law and order ofﬁcials in charge
of migration control seeking to gain autonomy in intergovernmental settings linked
their action to the single market and transnational crime. NGOs providing expertise
to Commission units seeking competence in non-economic areas jumped on the
‘social exclusion’ bandwagon by proposing anti-discrimination legislation. These
developments – superimposed on policies regarding free movement of workers and
services – are thus often contradictory and adhocratic.

‘garbage can’ model; immigration and asylum; policy frames and venues.

While ‘ﬁrst generation’ European Community (EC) policies such as the
common agricultural policy are under ﬁre, new policy domains are emerging
in the European Union (EU) framework. At the 1999 Tampere summit, EU
leaders declared that the development of a comprehensive immigration and

*EDITOR’S NOTE An earlier version of this article was presented as a paper to the 2001
EUSA conference and was awarded the prize for the best 2001 EUSA conference paper.

The prize selection committee (Dorothe´e Heisenberg, James Holliﬁeld, George Ross) noted
that Guiraudon’s paper ‘captures the complexity of contemporary EU policy formation in the
immigration area . . . [and] is remarkable for its recognition and mastery of different streams of
policy-making over time. It foregrounds real EU politics in an unstable, constantly changing set
of institutional arenas without imposing artiﬁcial social science parsimony. Reading the paper
we enter the EU as it is, not as we would like it to be in our a priori models. Guiraudon’s
refreshing theoretical quest instead goes toward the sociology of organizations, borrowing from
March and Olson’s ‘‘garbage can’’ approach.’
