Abstract Slum tourism in the Global South is a relatively new phenomenon. The tourist
gaze at the poverty of the Others is long established, though. This paper is concerned with
the genesis of urban poverty tourism. By placing the phenomenon of slumming in the wider
realm of the social upheavals in Victorian London and early twentieth century USA, the
historical review ﬁrst explains its dependency on the social context determining its emergence
and evolution. Secondly, slum tourism is shown to be adequately understood only if seen
as part of modern city tourism. Thirdly, it is demonstrate that the culturalization of poverty
attains special signiﬁcance in slum tourism. Fourthly, the history of slum tourism is shown
to have implications for understanding present-day slum tourism in the Global South, using
South Africa as an example. The article is designed to be a ﬁrst step towards understanding
the conditions, forms and consequences of globalization of slum tourism and the process of
constructing the global slum as a universal type of tourist destination.

Introduction

Tourism lives on what is different. Its economic implications alone urge it to constantly
create new products and open up new segments on the market. Tourism always looks
for new places, inventing sights and sites which are then marked and marketed as
tourist attractions. The fact that tourism needs innovations for purposes of self-
preservation is by no means new. What is interesting, however, is to take a look
beyond this pure logic of market mechanisms in order to ﬁnd out how, why and with
what implications places of tourism are socially constructed.

The emergence of a new trend in tourism, too, always gives rise to reﬂection
on why it emerges precisely at a particular point in time and in a particular social
context. Since the 1990s, one such new trend has been observable in long-distance
international tourism, a development which has been spreading rapidly on a global

basis and which, at ﬁrst sight, might look surprising; and that is ‘slum tourism’ in the
Global South. In spite of strong criticism coming from the international media, visits
to poor urban areas in big cities in the South are unmistakably gaining in importance
both in terms of tourism and in economic terms. How can this development be
explained? How and with what consequences are slums constructed as destinations
worth touring during a holiday?

In an increasing number of big cities in the Global South, poor urban settlements
are marketed for tourism. This slum tourism takes place primarily in the form of
guided tours – be they bus, jeep or walking tours. The slum tours already constitute
an important item in the range of offers made by the urban tourism industry. For
example, a slum tour has now become part of the standard programme of a visit to
Cape Town or Johannesburg; and a tour of Rocinha, Rio de Janeiro’s largest favela,
is, today, one of the tourist’s must dos, just as strolling at the beach of Ipanema
and climbing the Sugar Loaf. Estimates suggest an annual 300,000 or so tourists
embarking on slum tours in Cape Town (AP 2007) and approximately 40,000 in Rio
(Freire-Medeiros 2009). These ﬁgures indicate that slum tourism is already a highly
professionalized business in South Africa and Brazil. But slum tours have also been
meeting with increasing interest in other countries of the Global South, both among
tourists and providers, who see a huge growth potential in this branch of tourism. For
example, organized slum tours are executed, inter alia, in the poor areas of Manila
(Philippines), Jakarta (Indonesia), Cairo (Egypt), Buenos Aires (Argentina), Nairobi
(Kenya), Mazatl´an (Mexico), Bangkok (Thailand) and Windhoek (Namibia).

A current example is India, where slum tourism is noticeably expanding at present.
A driving force for this development has been the huge media attention in the wake
of eight-times Oscar-awarded Hollywood Film Slumdog Millionaire (2009), which
is acted against the backdrop of Dharavi, the largest slum in Mumbai (Hannam &
Knox 2010; Meschkank 2011).

The new phenomenon of slum tourism in the Global South not only reminds us
that tourism lives on what is novel and different; it suggests, at the same time, that
new trends in tourism are never created out of nothing. They draw upon more or less
known images and ideas about unfamiliar and distant regions and their inhabitants.
They have recourse to stocks of standardized long-standing ascriptions that arise in
discursive processes occurring both within and outside tourism. Tourism seeks for
discursive connectivity, reproduces these ascriptions and creates new meanings, while
reacting to social structures and their changes. Allegedly new forms of tourism almost
always have historical forerunners with which they link semantically and from which
their speciﬁc repertoire of offers develops. For example, tourism in ‘Europe’s Cultural
Capitals’ or cultural sightseeing tours organized by companies like the German ﬁrm
Studiosus can be traced back to the ‘Grand Tour’, the educational tours of the nobility
in the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries (cf. Adler 1989). Similarly, contemporary mass
seaside tourism has a long history, which began from the ‘discovery of the coast’ in
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and led, via Brighton as the archetype of the

seaside resort, to the ‘global beach’ (L¨ofgren 1999) as a present-day global-universal
destination type (cf. also Shields 1991).

Today’s slum tourism in the Global South has forerunners, too. This paper seeks
to illustrate how ‘long-established’ modes of constructing, presenting and perceiving
slums as places worth touring ﬁnd their way into the current practice of poverty
tourism. Hence, the reconstruction of the roughly 150-year-old tradition of this form
of tourism is not only of interest with regard to the illustration of the history of the
development of tourism; it can also provide valuable clues to an understanding of
today’s forms and modes of constructing slums as ‘places of tourism’ (Pott 2007). If
we assume that the tourist gaze (Urry 1990) at poverty is long established (at least
in its essential features), then current poverty tourism as such will be less astounding
than the dynamism of its global spread. An overriding goal of research on slum
tourism, then, would consist in grasping the conditions, forms and consequences of
its globalization. The present paper, which is primarily concerned with the genesis
of poverty tourism, is designed to be a ﬁrst step towards understanding the process
of constructing the global slum as a global-universal type of tourist destination.

In this paper, a brief presentation of the recent phenomenon – drawing upon the
example of township tourism in South Africa – will be followed by a closer look into
the long-standing tradition of slum tourism. By attempting to place the phenomenon in
the wider realm of the social and cultural upheavals happening in each of the periods
studied, the historical review seeks, ﬁrst, to explain its dependency on the social
context determining its emergence and evolution. Secondly, it will become clear that
slum tourism can be adequately understood only if seen as part of modern city tourism.
Thirdly, the historical review will demonstrate that and how the ‘culturalization’ of
poverty attains special signiﬁcance in slum tourism. Fourthly, the closing remarks
indicate in what respects the insights gained from the historical review can be drawn
upon for enquiries into present-day slum tourism in the Global South.

Slumming in the Global South: the Example of Township Tourism
in South Africa

‘Township tourism’ is South Africa’s version of the new global phenomenon of
poverty tourism. It is meant to serve here as an example to start from in my analytical
concern with the phenomenon.

The economic signiﬁcance of international tourism for South Africa has increased
considerably since the end of apartheid. The number of international arrivals in the
country rose from 3.6 million in 1994 to 9.1 million in 2007 (Steinbrink & Frehe
2008). In terms of its signiﬁcance for South Africa’s GNP, the tourism sector has,
meanwhile, even outdone gold mining, which has for long been the backbone of
that country’s national economy. It is expected that tourism’s economic importance
will continue to grow even in the future, thanks to the 2010 football world cup (cf.
Haferburg & Steinbrink 2010).

Generally speaking, the tourist industry sees the country’s tourism potential in
its landscape and natural beauty (national parks, impressive mountain landscapes,
beaches, vineyards, etc.). However, following the end of apartheid, township tourism
has been developing as a new branch of the tourism industry – a development which
has little to do with the traditional sights. Township tourism is organized mainly in the
form of guided bus tours which run through selected townships. The tour destinations
are the urban residential areas of those population groups formerly classiﬁed as
‘non-white’, residential areas which emerged during the era of the apartheid regime
and which were planned on the basis of that regime’s inhuman racist ideology. It
is the poorest strata of the population that live in the townships. The majority of
the ‘black’ city dwellers still live there – and, largely, still under deplorable living
conditions.

Township tourism had forerunners during the apartheid era, but in its recent form it
started in the early 1990s. The ﬁrst township tours were conducted to Soweto (South
Western Township) in Johannesburg. At the time, township tourism was a kind of
niche tourism for politically interested travellers who wanted to visit Soweto as a
place symbolizing oppression and the anti-apartheid struggle, their aim being to see
the sites of resistance and the houses in which symbolic ﬁgures, such as Nelson
Mandela and Bishop Tutu, used to live. It was from there that township tourism
evolved rapidly, expanding over the whole of South Africa as a phenomenon of urban
tourism. An ever-increasing number of international travellers – predominantly from
Britain, Germany, The Netherlands and the USA – travelled through the townships
and informal settlements of different historical origins and sizes during their holidays
in South Africa. In the process, historical and political aspects which had initially
been the focus shifted to the background (Rolfes et al. 2009).

According to ofﬁcial data, over 300,000 tourists participated in organized tours in
Cape Town in 2006 (AP 2007). This is almost 25 percent of the total annual number
of overseas international visitors. Apart from the trip to the Table Mountain, the trip to
Cape Point, the visit to the Waterfront and a wine tour, township tourism is among the
‘things to tick off the list’ while visiting Cape Town. Township tourism is a booming
business. More and more tour operators are pushing their way into the market. In Cape
Town, roughly 50 different tour operators can be identiﬁed. Meanwhile, an increasing
number of big travel agencies operating on an international or a supra-regional basis
now also include township tours in their – otherwise rather conventional – range of
products. Township tourism has thus developed into a phenomenon of mass tourism
in South Africa (cf. Rolfes & Steinbrink 2009).

To understand the phenomenon of slum tourism, it appears useful to ﬁrst discuss
the question of what the slum actually ‘is’ – not from a social-scientiﬁc perspective
or from the perspective of town planning, but from the viewpoint of tourism. In order
to ﬁnd out what tourists look for in the slums, the question as to what they expect
to ﬁnd there would suggest itself. (They want to see what they expect to see!) It
appears plausible to assume that the attractiveness of slums as tourist destinations is

author’s own representation).

directly connected with the images, conceptions and associations the tourists have
of the places they intend to visit; in the case of South Africa, this would mean their
image of the township.

What images, then, do tourists have of the townships? This question constituted the
focus of a study project conducted in Cape Town in 2007. Questions were put to 179
tourists, immediately before embarking on a township tour, on what they associated
with the term ‘township’ (cf. Rolfes et al. 2009).

The results reveal that negative associations dominate the picture (see Figure 1).
‘Township’ is associated with crime, squalor, drugs, poor housing conditions,
apartheid, unemployment, etc. The most frequently mentioned association by far was
‘poverty’. ‘Poverty’ is in the centre of the semantic ﬁeld evoked by the term ‘town-
ship’. Meschkank (2011: 55) obtains very similar results in her study of tourism in
Dharavi/Mumbai: ‘If you ask the tourists participating in a Dharavi tour what they
expect to see, the most common answer is: poverty’. It is, therefore, appropriate to
understand township tourism as a kind of poverty tourism.

Yet, ‘poverty’ does not characterize this form of tourism sufﬁciently. For – as
in the case of many other forms of tourism – ‘spatialization’ plays a central role
in endeavours that make it possible to visualize and experience poverty and, thus,

in the construction of urban tourism as a whole. Poverty’s territorial localization
makes it possible for it to be expected, planned and visited for purposes of tourism.
Consequently, the tours are conducted to certain areas, to city districts categorized
as townships, as favelas or, generally, as slums. It is in these areas that poverty is
located; this is where poverty can be expected and experienced – the slum is the ‘place
of poverty’. The term ‘slumming’ explained further below, therefore, describes this
form of poverty tourism very precisely.

The results of the studies stated above are, understandably, startling, since they do
contradict common notions of what tourists do during their holiday. True, gazing at
poverty may indeed lead to the striven-for ‘distance away from everyday life’; yet,
the wish to see ‘something else’ as expressed in the common holiday motives usually
refers to something nice, beautiful and relaxing. In contrast thereto, township tourism
seems to correspond to what MacCannell (1976) calls ‘negative sightseeing’: a kind of
social bungee jumping in which the predominantly bourgeois thrill-seekers – driven
by a lust for angst (cf. Welz 1993: 48) – seek to experience the social depth. The slum
tours seem to permit tourists to fathom out the possible drop height sensuously (using
their eyes, ears and noses), but without themselves actually running the risk of a hard
landing (Steinbrink & Frehe 2008). But I doubt that the lust for the socio-voyeuristic
thrill and the wish to experience a ‘safe danger’ or an ‘insulated adventure’ (Schmidt
1979) is sufﬁcient to grasp this phenomenon of tourism analytically. This element of
‘controlled risk’ (Freire-Medeiros 2009) is only a very partial explanation of what
motivates tourists to visit impoverished urban areas.

Here, the question immediately arises as to the origin of this tourist gaze at the
poverty of Others. How has the tourist interest in the slum developed historically?
What traditions of spatializing observation and interpretations exist in the collective
memory of the tourists? How, then, is it conceivable that ‘places of poverty’ have
become ‘places of tourism’ (Pott 2007)?

A Review of the History of Slumming

The concept of ‘slumming’ has described a particular social practice for one and a
half centuries; in this practice, members of wealthy population groups visit residential
areas of poor urban groups in their leisure time. The origins of this practice lie in the
metropolises of the North, especially in Britain and the USA, where modern (urban)
tourism also evolved.

The ‘slum’ has always symbolized the ‘dark’, the ‘low’, the ‘unknown’ side of
the city; it has always been a projection surface. From the bourgeois perspective, the
poor urban areas have constantly been constructed as areas containing ‘the Other’.
Accordingly, visiting a slum for leisure purposes has always been done in the wish
to experience the Other. However, what was identiﬁed as being ‘the Other’ varied
from one historical period to another and depended on the respective social context
in which it existed.

Victorian London: The Cradle of Slumming

The practice of slumming has its roots in nineteenth-century London. It was from
there that the phenomenon started, and it did so, as will be seen later, in a very
Victorian-Anglican manner.

London – at the time, the politically and economically most powerful city in the
world and capital of the world-encompassing British Empire – developed into a de-
mographic colossus in the nineteenth century. Its population grew from one million to
six million within one hundred years. Its urbanization rates, which were due primarily
to rural exodus and immigrations from Ireland, were just as enormous as was the gap
between the rich and the poor. In the course of urbanization and industrialization,
the social classes were separated geographically in a typically European east–west
divide. The blatant urban segregation pattern appeared like the spatial conﬁguration
of the deeply split social order of the time.

Originally ‘slum’ was a slang expression which referred to individual lodgings,
then to backyards (‘back slums’) and later to whole urban quarters (Mayne 1993). The
etymological origin of the word is controversial. The Oxford Dictionary of Etymology
describes it as a word of unknown origin, but presumes a ‘gypsy’ origin (Hoad 1996).
Cassidy (2007), however, presupposes an Irish origin (s’lom [pron. s’lum], the Irish
meaning being ‘is bare, is naked, is poor’). Davis (2007: 26) refers to the Vocabulary
of the Flash Language by Vaux (1912), according to which slum means something
like ‘swindle’ or ‘criminal machinations’ (translations based on German version
(2007) of Planet of Slums (2006)). According to Dyos et al. (1982), it was Cardinal
Wiseman who turned the term ‘slum’ into a term of the standard language from
around 1820 onwards. Dyos et al. (1982) point out that Wiseman was often quoted in
British newspapers in that time, slowly leading to the wider popular use of the term
‘slum’ for a more general description of destitute urban housing conditions (ibid).
Since the mid of the 19th century, certain poor settlements in the USA, France and
India were also labelled as slums (Davis 2007: 26).

London’s rapid growth resulted in the fact that its inhabitants no longer knew
every part of their city from personal experience. An ‘imaginative geography’ of the
city thus emerged in parallel with the clear spatial separation between the rich and
the poor. From the viewpoint of the top of the vertical hierarchy of London’s social
structure, the slums of the East End represented the dark ‘abyss’. One needs only
to take a glance at Peter Keating’s collection of social reports (Keating 1976) from
that time to notice how often the word ‘abyss’ occurs in the titles alone. The slum,
according to this observation, labels the place of the physical, social, economic and
moral abyss and of the threatening fall into the bottomless pit.

In the perception of London’s middle and upper classes, the East End slums were
‘places of the unknown Other’. The existence of these places alone was a cause for
concern and fear in society. The fears, however, were not only about sanitary and
hygienic conditions and the threat of epidemics (in particular, cholera). Rather, there

Downloaded by [Leeds Metropolitan University] at 12:54 26 February 2012 8 M. Steinbrink

were also social worries about the decline of civilization and the loss of public control.
This gave rise to an image of the East End as another world – chaotic, uncivilized
and horrifying. In other words, the slum represented the materialized anti-thesis to
the bourgeois order of the Victorian era (Frank 2003: 53).

The nineteenth century was the period of colonial voyages of discovery, and the
deletion of white spots on the world map was a British passion at that time. In
Victorian London, the East End was often referred to as the ‘dark continent’ (cf.
Frank 2003: 54f.; Lindner 2004) – the same designation used for Africa.

As there is a darkest Africa, is there not also a darkest England? . . . May
we not ﬁnd a parallel at our doors and discover within a stone’s throw of our
cathedrals and palaces places of similar horrors to those which Stanley has
found in the Equatorial forest? (Booth 1890: 11–12).

By analogy with the colonial voyage of discovery, the explorer’s spirit, too, awoke in
the city, the aim of which was to discover ‘the distant’ in ‘the near-by’ (‘at our doors’,
‘within a stone’s throw’). There was an awakening of interest in social expeditions
into the abysmal depths of the urban terra incognita.

The ﬁrst people to go on these ‘social expeditions’ were clergymen, such as
William Booth, founder of the Salvation Army, journalists and social reformers. In
their reports, they tended to present themselves as explorers who ventured, dead-tired,
into the bottomless social swamp. Their reports established a new literary genre –
the exploratory social reportage. In their writings, the social reporters decisively
inﬂuenced and shaped the discourse on the East End, and the prevailing image of its
inhabitants.

To the wealthy of London, the slums were, on the one hand, a threatening strange
world. On the other hand, however, the slums promised adventures and formed the
projection space for the wildest of fantasies. Frequently wrapped in the cloak of
concern, welfare and charity, more and more private benefactors in the middle of the
century were setting off for the ‘undiscovered land of the poor’. Early forms of slum
tours were already encountered here. At the time, the discovery tours to London’s East
End were guided by police ofﬁcers in civilian attire, journalists and clergy (Figure 2).
These upper-class visits in the East End were called ‘slumming’ as early as around
1850 (cf. Koven 2006). The term ‘slumming’ is, therefore, almost as old as the term
‘slum’ itself. Koven (2006: 6–10) notes that from the outset, the term slumming
was mostly used with a scornful to explicitly derogatory connotation by members of
the upper class, who, for their part, did not indulge in this practice. ‘Slumming, the
word and the activity associated with it, was distinguished historically by a persistent
pattern of disavowal. It was a pejorative term . . . ’ (Koven 2006: 8). The curiosity
about the slum that ﬁnds expression in the slumming activity did indeed evoke
suspicion from the very beginning, particularly in regard to the motivation of the
so-called slummers (i.e. those who practised slumming). Behind the lofty intentions

transmitted outwardly, other, less noble, motives were suspected, motives of which
the slummers should obviously have been ashamed.

This suggests that more was associated with the slum – the place of the ‘unknown
Other’ – than just the difference in economic terms. There was more to slums than
their characterization as places of poverty. For there were also association chains
linked to ‘poverty’ which stretched into ﬁelds that lay outside the economic sphere.
It can be shown that ‘slum’ and ‘poverty’ have experienced a semantic coupling
resulting from the talk about the ‘omnipresence of ﬁlth and dirt’ (cf. Lindner 2004:
20). An indication of how closely ‘slum’ and ‘dirt’ are connotatively connected is
given by the observation that at the turn of the century, the term ‘slum’ was often
rendered in German as Schlammviertel (‘mud quarter’) (cf. Spiller 2008 [1911]).

The words ‘ﬁlth’ and ‘dirt’ lie at the point where two chains of association deriving
from slum and poverty intersect (Figure 3). Both chains of association lead directly
into corporeality – in particular, into the lower zones of the body: through cholera,
a serious form of diarrhoea, into the anus, and through lust, into the genitals. The
Victorian era was a period in which corporeality was denied and concealed in the
bourgeois milieu. It thus becomes clear that ‘dirt’ indeed is by no means only a

representation.

hygienic category and that it has always been a moral category, too, which refers to
something indecent and repugnant.

In the middle- and upper-class discourse over the slum, an almost direct equation
of the poor sanitary conditions with a state of moral decay took place. Through the
close semantic relation between ‘poverty’, ‘dirt’ and ‘sin’, the poverty concept also
became subjected to moralizing and, through the assignment of poverty to certain
areas, a connection was ﬁnally established between urban topography and morality,
which was tantamount to the construction of a moral topography of the city.

The slums apparently strongly provoked the dirty fantasies of London’s bour-
geoisie, its ‘belief’ in moral standards notwithstanding. From the middle-class point
of view, poverty and slums have stood not only for misery and disease, but also for
eroticism, licentiousness and sexual savagery. Little wonder, then, that the slums,
in the eyes of London’s society, which was shaped by rigid moral expectations and
inﬂexible social rules, were areas of both gloomy threat and erotic curiosity: slums
were places of moral decay and places of libidinal liberty (cf. Lindner 2004: 19ff.).
This explains indeed why the non-slummers often imputed ﬁlthy motives to the
slummers. And it also explains why the professional or altruist slummers (the clergy,
social reformers, benefactors, etc.) made repeated attempts to distinguish themselves
from the casual or leisure slummers to avoid being thrown into the same ‘pot of mud’,
in view of their noble motives (cf. also Koven 2006).

In the second half of the nineteenth century, however, slumming increasingly
developed into a more ‘purpose-free’ leisure-time activity of London’s higher classes.

Amusement shifted into the centre of things and the ‘lust for vice’, as well as interest
in the ‘immoral Other’, became more clearly visible. The new phenomenon had
hardly gained contours as a leisure-time entertainment, when its globalization began.
Slumming was now making its way ‘across the pond’.

‘Let’s Go Slumming in the USA’

In the USA, the phenomenon of slumming emerged for the ﬁrst time in New York
in the 1880s. Figure 4 shows a cutting from an 1884 issue of the New York Times.
The journalist who wrote this newspaper article described slumming as “the [latest]
rage”, as a London peculiarity and new fashion (“a fashionable London Mania”;
“the latest fashionable idiosyncrasy in London”) imported to New York by well-to-
do tourists from England. Additionally, he prophesied that this extravagant fashion
would develop into a hype amongst the New Yorkers– and he was later proven right.
The idea of slumming fell on fertile ground in the USA. However, its social breeding
ground in the USA differed from that in Victorian England. The phenomenon, there-
fore, did develop differently in America. Following the ﬁrst appearance of slumming
in the ‘New World’, a process of change was evolving which was very interesting
in regard to the genesis of poverty tourism as a whole. In the social context of the

Downloaded by [Leeds Metropolitan University] at 12:54 26 February 2012 12 M. Steinbrink

USA in the early twentieth century, the element of moral difference remained char-
acteristic of slumming (Dowling 2007; Heap 2009) but, successively, other markers
of difference became more dominant in the construction of the slum as the ‘place of
the Other’. This change in the construction of ‘the Other’ localized in the slum will
be the subject of our further discussion.

Touristiﬁcation of slumming – urban heterogeneity as a tourist attraction. Although
slumming in London already comprised certain elements of tourism – e.g. Koven
(2006) indicates that Victorian Travel Guidebooks recommended visits to charitable
institutions in the East End – it was in New York that one could actually speak of the
‘touristiﬁcation’ of slumming.

The occurrence of slumming in the USA was directly linked with the development
of international (urban) tourism. As indicated in the above-quoted New York Times
article (see Figure 4), it was the tourists from England who carried the idea of
slumming in their mental luggage. And now, the ladies and gentlemen from London
wanted to visit the poorer areas in New York (e.g. Bowery, Five Points), too, during
their sightseeing tours. Here, then, for the ﬁrst time, the element of a regionalizing
(cultural) comparison, which is typical of (urban) tourism, appears on the scene.
Urban tourism is fundamentally based on the spatial differentiation between here and
there. For the fact that cities become places worth touring is based on a spatially
indicated expectation of difference (cf. Pott 2007: 113). Consequently, the ﬁrst slum
tourists from London compared ‘their’ London East End with the Lower East Side
in Manhattan:

A quite well-known young English Noble, returning from a tour of the east
side the other night with some friends, observed over his brandy and soda:
‘Ah, this is a great city, but you have no slums like we have. I have been in
rickety condemned buildings that it was absolutely dangerous to go through!
Found six families living in one miserably ventilated cellar – 24 persons, 10
of them adults, living in one room. No such slums here!’ (New York Times, 14
September 1884).

It was through the practice of slumming that poor urban areas ﬁrst became tourist
sights which were then drawn upon for comparisons between the tourist’s own city
with the one visited. In other words: it was in New York that the tourist’s comparative
gaze, in search of the differences between ‘own city’ and the destination, ﬁrst designed
the slum as an urban tourist attraction.

Slumming in the USA developed in such a way that the slummers could give in to
their tourist curiosity without being ashamed of doing so. Entertainment intentions
were professed more openly; the tourists were now in a position to cast off the moral
cover without having any qualms. Compared to slumming in London, slumming in
New York at the end of the nineteenth century was no longer about social reformist

matters; it was rather about showcasing and experiencing slums as interesting tourist
sights.

For the ﬁrst time, too, even the guidebooks at the time recommended routes
for walking tours in the cities, which passed through various working-class areas
(cf. Keeler 1902; Ingersoll 1906). Shortly before the turn of the century, the ﬁrst
tour companies were established in Manhattan, Chicago and San Francisco; these
companies specialized in guided slum visits, both reproducing and altering the slum
semantics that had emerged in London. Due to the commercialization of slum tours,
slumming became open to a broader range of customers. More and more city tourists
from other parts of the USA were now participating in slum tours. Slumming had
become an integral part of urban tourism (Cocks 2001: 174ff.).

The strong interest taken in slumming in the cities of the USA was closely linked
with the image of the cosmopolitan metropolis simultaneously evolving in that era.
This image comprised the notion of an internal heterogeneity of the city, of the inner-
urban juxtaposition of the unequal, the co-existence of backwardness and modernity,
and of wealth and poverty. America’s cities quite symbolically exempliﬁed the con-
cept of the cosmopolitan city. Urban tourism took up this idea, and in its modes of
representation, it reproduced the discursive connection between largeness, density,
strangeness, heterogeneity and urban cosmopolitanism: city tourism marketing and
image campaigns pursued the aim of presenting the internal differences within the
cities in order to highlight the cosmopolitan character of the urban destinations. In
the process, the thematized differences were spatially assigned to different parts of
the city. The commercial slum visits, too, were explicitly referred to particular city
quarters, thus emphasizing the schema of spatial classiﬁcation. Another reason, there-
fore, why the slums were also seen as ‘sights worth visiting’ was that they were
conceived of as an expression of the city’s internal heterogeneity, of the wealth of
contrasts of city life, and of its cosmopolitan diversity. In this way, the slums and slum
tours contributed towards making the city as a whole an attractive tourist destination.
‘Culture’ is the dominant mode of observation in urban tourism and, indeed, a
deﬁning feature of urban tourism as a speciﬁc form of tourism in its own merit (as
opposed to seaside tourism, hiking and many other forms of tourism) (cf. Pott 2007:
109ff.). Since slumming became an integral element of modern urban tourism in
America, the two comparative perspectives discussed – the heterogenizing perspec-
tive, which emphasizes the internal diversity of the city (this one here vs. that one
there), and the comparative perspective (tourist’s own town vs. town visited) – can
be understood as variants of the tourists’ cultural observation schema. And, indeed,
culture is explicitly referred to precisely when the heterogenizing schema which fo-
cuses on inner-urban spatial differences is being applied in the context of slumming.
The next section will examine this aspect more closely.

Ethnicization of slumming – the immigrant quarter as a tourist attraction. The
representation of America’s metropolitan tourist destinations emphasized the spa-
tial juxtaposition of different cultures within the city. The special focus was on

ethno-cultural differences. This discursive framework did also structure the slum-
ming phenomenon in urban tourism (cf. Conforti 1996; Dowling 2007; Heap 2009).
Thus, it was in the American version of slumming that ‘ethnicity’ became a dominant
category. The slumming tours, which had evolved in different cities all over the States
after the turn of the century, predominantly went to the urban enclaves of the new
immigrant groups from Eastern and Southern Europe, and from Asia. This led to
the development of a phenomenon that Cocks (2001) calls ‘ethnic slumming’. The
destination slum was now constructed as a ‘place of the ethno-cultural Other’.

It is revealing to look at this ethnicization of slumming against the social back-
ground at the time of its emergence. Ethnic slumming evolved in a period in which
the signiﬁcance of ‘racial’ and ‘national’ categories was undergoing rapid and fun-
damental changes in the political system of the USA. Between 1880 and 1920, there
were millions of immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe and from Asia en-
tering the USA. This brought about feelings of disquiet among the so-called White
Anglo-Saxon Protestants (WASPs). Many felt threatened by this wave of immigra-
tion, and they assumed that the non-Protestant groups (Catholics, Jews and adherents
of Asian religions) were less capable of being integrated in American society than
were the old immigrant groups from Northern and Western Europe.

It was at that time that public approval of the idea of ‘racial equality’ was undergo-
ing a noticeable decline. In particular, the former slaves and their descendants were
excluded from participation in political life; in the Southern States, legislation was
adopted ensuring their residential segregation and the deprivation of their rights and,
in the rest of the country, this was wrongfully practised as well (Cocks 2001: 187).
On the whole, nationality and racial classiﬁcations were relevant categories with
regard to access to jobs and housing. Racism and xenophobia shaped many sectors
of society, including urban development (Cocks 2001). This led to the emergence of
the well-known immigrant colonies (e.g. Little Italy, Chinatown, Judea and Russian
Quarter) in the big cities of the USA, quarters that were often characterized by poor
urban housing conditions and economic poverty.

For tourism, on the other hand, these places became exotic, colourful attractions
(cf. Conforti 1996). The segregated quarters were presented as picturesque and aes-
thetically complementary to the modern parts of the city. Perceiving them as a natural
part of the modern metropolis brought about some relief from the everyday discourse
over immigrants and their unsettling otherness.

The then prevailing concept of culture, which was also relevant to tourism, con-
stituted a combination of modernist-evolutionist and racist thinking. The notion of
‘race’ comprised both biological and (unalterable) cultural particularities. According
to this notion, the respective ‘races’ and their ‘natural modes of life’ represent hierar-
chical stages in the process of human evolution. White Americans as well as Northern
and Western Europeans, the notion suggests, are at the very top of the evolutionary
ladder, followed by Eastern and Southern Europeans, Asians, ‘American Indians’
and – at the very bottom of the ladder – the Blacks. Culture and cultural forms of

expression – from literature to handicraft and music, and to lifestyle, world view and
ways of social interaction – were interpreted as expressions of race and/or national
origin. This notion permitted the tourists to see the living and working conditions of
the different immigrant groups as expressions of a ‘cultural identity’. To them, the
immigrant-quarters dwellers functioned as bearers of their respective cultures. What-
ever they did was interpreted as a cultural expression of their ‘unalterable nature’ (cf.
Cocks 2001).

The tourist representation of the different immigrant quarters – take the exam-
ple of San Francisco’s Chinatown – focused on the ‘cultural identities’ of the in-
habitants and accentuated their cultural otherness. The representations in tourism
largely fell back on stereotypes and homogenizing ascriptions in order to meet the
tourists’ expectations as regards observable differences and thus to fulﬁl their quest for
authenticity.

The ethnic categorization and essentialization of social reality in the context of
urban tourism contributed to the legitimization of the social and economic dispari-
ties. Observed within the cultural schema, the immigrant groups were symbolically
assigned to their place – both spatially (i.e. within ‘their’ quarters) and socially (i.e.
at the margins of society). Along with the presentation and interpretation of observ-
able differences as cultural (and quasi-natural) differences, the social inequalities
were deproblematized. The slum was no longer regarded as a manifestation of socio-
structural conditions of inequality, but as an expression of the cultural conﬁguration
of a modern American metropolis.

It follows that the display of the American city for purposes of urban tourism
by no means presented it as a materialized symbol of the assimilation of various
immigrant groups in American society. On the contrary, what it presented was a
relatively unconnected form of coexistence. The ideology of the social melting pot had
become fragile anyway. With the presentation of immigrant quarters as picturesque
elements of a loose conglomerate of single cultural spaces, slumming fulﬁlled a
relieving function: it masked the problem-related assimilation discourse which was
omnipresent in bourgeois political discussions and in the media – in favour of the
observation of the colourful, exotic places of the ‘ethnic Other’ (Figure 5).

Apart from international tourists, it was the bourgeois WASPs who visited the
immigrant quarters. The WASPs regarded America as the most modern of all countries
and the American people as culturally superior. To them, the inhabitants and cultures
of the slums were in contradistinction to their own culture. They considered the slum
dwellers and their cultures backward, irrational and paralysing to progress. Modern
Americans, the WASPs believed, did not adhere to superstition, but practised science,
and their culture was characterized not by tradition and stagnation, but by rationality
and progress.

Yet, at the turn of the century, modernity and progress were certainly viewed
critically, too. The pace at which the built environment was changing gave rise to
feelings of insecurity among many Americans, just as the change in values and the

crumbling of old certainties did. The pressure of progress and of having to advance
at all costs was also experienced as a burden. This led to the emergence of new
emotional longings within America’s middle class, for example the yearning for a
pre-modern world, for warmth, deceleration and communal togetherness (cf. Conforti
1996). The slum visits served this purpose. The immigrant quarters were turned into
sights on which these nostalgic yearnings could focus. The quarters symbolized a
‘way of life’ which seemed to be more strongly ﬁlled with social meaning than the
modern everyday life of the tourist in a cold and sterile American society determined
by market rationalism and individualism. The slumming tours thus helped to give
the living conditions in the segregated city districts an idyllic character. Hence, they
intensiﬁed the trend towards romanticizing urban poverty (cf. Cocks 2001).

The destination slum produced by the early form of urban tourism in Europe and
North America was thus adapted, on the one hand, to the image of the modern,
heterogeneous city. However, with its romantic connotations, it also served, at the
same time, as a place of desire for tourists, permitting them to experience a pre-
modern world of a bygone era. The culturalization of the slum, with the described
homogenization, essentialization and idyllicization of social conditions, looked like a
legitimization of the social and economic disparities within American society. Ethnic
slumming, therefore, does not mean the reduction of social distance; in effect, it
always means its creation and reafﬁrmation.

Conclusion: Global Slumming, the Global Slum and Othering in Tourism

The review illustrates that my initial observation of a new practice of tourism in Cape
Town, Rio de Janeiro and Mumbai is only correct to a limited extent. There is no
doubt that poverty tourism has been spreading with a remarkable dynamism in many
countries of the Global South since the 1990s. Yet, this phenomenon only represents
the most recent stage in the 150-year-old history of tourist slumming.

The present globalization of this form of tourism, which for long was conﬁned to
the big cities of the North, can be understood as a change in, and as a further stage
of development of, slum tourism on a global scale. A continuation of slum tourism
is ensured by the fact that essential elements of its earlier forms are incorporated
into its current practice (see Table 1). Visiting and experiencing poverty, which is
territorially assigned to certain city areas (‘slums’), has remained the goal of slum
tourism. This kind of spatialization serves to concretize and visualize poverty. The
examples from London and the USA demonstrate that the slum was always construed
and experienced as ‘the other side of the city’ and as the ‘place of the Other’; at the
same time, they illustrate that this ‘Other’ had always been a lot more than just
the ‘economic Other’. Therefore, the culturalization of poverty is essential to slum
tourism. While in the townships of today’s South Africa the tourist gaze is focused on
‘African culture’, seeking to ﬁnd a culture of locals (or a culture of locality) orientated
to a sense of community and attachment to locality, in Victorian London, poverty was
addressed moralizingly in the discursive context of a culture of licentiousness. And
in the USA of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, it is culturalization
that was practised as ethnicization in the slum tours.

In spite of the continuity one may observe, the reconstruction of the genesis of
slum tourism also clearly reveals changes in the phenomenon. What is regarded as
‘the Other worth visiting’ and how the cultural mode of observation assumes concrete
shape varies from social context to social context. The coding of the cultural schema
with its dominant distinction between ‘the moral’ and ‘the immoral’, which was
very relevant in the case of London, changed when slumming was touristiﬁed in the
American context. Moral aspects still played an important role in American Slumming
(Dowling 2007; Heap 2009), but the focus of the culturalizing tourist gaze shifted
towards the immigrant cultures, which the tourists (most of them WASPs) observed
as pre-modern in a bid to distinguish them from their own culture. The destination
‘slum’ was presented as the ‘place of the ethnic pre-modern Other’. One still comes
across both codings of the cultural schema (moral/immoral and modern/ethnically
pre-modern) in present-day slum tourism in the Global South (see Rolfes &
Steinbrink 2009; Rolfes 2010; Meschkank 2011). Both codings (and there may
be more) have entered the semantics of recent slumming. Today, however, there
seemingly is a new dominant coding: the distinction between ‘the global’ and ‘the
local’ (see Figure 5).

In a summarizing comparison, we could, therefore, contrast Moral Slumming in
London’s East End of the nineteenth century and Ethnic Slumming in the USA of
the early twentieth century on the one hand, with today’s form of slumming on the
other. In the further development of slum tourism in times of a world-encompassing
long-distance mass tourism, it is not only a global extension of the phenomenon
that is taking place. The distinctions made between North (origin of the tourists)
and South (slums as the destinations of the tourists) are also gaining considerably
in importance. This includes the distinctions between the global (‘global village’)

and the local (slums as places of cultural distance in the global village), as well as
between the globalized tourist from the North and the local slum dweller in the South.
Does the ‘destination slum’ represent a yearning for locality in a globalizing world?
Is the ‘destination slum’ a place to visit in order to experience the world’s cultural
diversity threatened by the homogenizing forces of globalization (‘McDonaldiza-
tion’) and global tourism (‘Disneyﬁcation’)? In that sense it appears appropriate to
speak of Global Slumming in today’s context. Current examples of slum tourism in
Africa (Rolfes & Steinbrink 2009; Rolfes 2010), Asia (Meschkank 2011) and Latin
America (Freire-Medeiros 2009) and their representation in commercials and we-
blogs give evidence. They can be interpreted as indications of the process that the
new global/local observation schema, together with the historical semantic elements
of slum constructions, are developing world-wide into a universal destination type –
the Global Slum.

‘Global slumming’ and ‘global slum’ are still fairly imprecise terms. However, the
future analysis of the processes and constructions they denote can, indeed, build on
the reconstruction of the genesis of slum tourism. In addition to the results already
summarized, the review also draws attention to the fact that slum tourism, from
its appearance in New York onwards, can be interpreted as an integral element of
modern urban tourism. Furthermore, the accounts on slumming in London and New
York show that the construction of ‘the Other’ has always been based, and continues
to be based, on stereotyping. The tourism-speciﬁc localization of the Other in the
slum (re-)produces a homogenizing and essentializing perspective. The tendency
towards the deproblematization and depoliticization of social inequalities arising
from the culturalist gaze practised and exercised in early forms of slum tourism is
still observable in recent forms. Moreover, I have repeatedly called attention to the
dependence of the forms of slum tourism and modes of observation on social contexts.
For the analysis of current township tourism in South Africa, for example, this would
mean examining the forms of tourism against the background of a functionally
differentiated globalized world society, of social transformations taking place in
South Africa in the post-apartheid era, of the competition of cities in the global
marketplace, etc. (see Table 1).

There is a further ﬁnding that seems important in connection with the necessary
social contextualization of the analysis of tourism, since it reveals some promising
potential as a frame of reference. I will look into it very brieﬂy here. The reconstruction
of slum tourism documented in this article not only illustrates the variability of
the slum tourist construction of ‘the Other’ and/or of the ‘place of the Other’; it
equally reminds us that this – like any other construction of the Other – refers to the
identity of the tourists themselves and the process of its construction (as the other
side of ‘the Other’). In this sense, slumming can be interpreted as a part of a self-
constituting ‘Othering’ (Reuter 2002). The destination slum, which emerges through
the spatialization of the self-constituting Other at the ‘other place’ (the place of ‘the
Other’), functions as a medium of Othering and thus as a medium of the construction

of the tourist’s own identity. Regardless of whether ‘the Other’ localized in the slum
is repudiatingly (e.g. as ‘the frightening Other’) or positively connoted (e.g. as ‘the
exotic, attractive Other’), the slum remains a medium of self-reﬂexive Othering. The
slum functions as a symbol turned space, as ‘the foreign’ to which ‘the tourist’s ‘own’
is related, be that by comparing or by contrasting – no matter whether ‘the Other’ is
seen as cold and threatening or warm and romantic. The demarcation line remains
untouched, as it is a precondition for the tourist’s experience of identity.

If we consider current slum tourism against the background of globalization, and if
we relate it to the contemporary horizon of a world society, then it would make sense
to study the recent slumming phenomenon as part of a global Othering process. For,
in contrast to its historical forerunners, slumming in the Global South is evidently no
longer merely about ‘the other side of the city’ or about intra-societal heterogeneity,
but, additionally – and perhaps essentially – about the ‘other side of the world’. This
brings the self-constituting process of constructing a ‘world-societal Other’ to the
foreground.

A postcolonial perspective, therefore, suggests itself for the in-depth analysis of
contemporary slum tourism in the south. The cultural theory of Postcolonial Studies
offers different valuable approaches to a critical look into the origin and effects of
representations of ‘the Cultural’, ‘the Other’ and ‘the Foreign’, or of ‘the Culturally
Hybrid’ which emerges through cultural contact. Although postcolonial theories have
successfully proven their analytical usefulness in various disciplines, international
tourism research has made relatively little use of them so far. This is astonishing, given
the fact that tourism from ‘the West’ has been (re-)producing considerably powerful
representations of ‘the Rest’ (cf. Hall 1992). Thus, as regards future research on
slumming, the question is now spotlighted of whether, in what respects and with
what consequences slum tourism in the Global South is embedded in postcolonial
discourses.
