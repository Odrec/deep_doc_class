Homework 2 – Exercise 5 

Compare the histogram distributions between the whole image and the fixated regions. You 

don’t need to run statistical tests, just report on your observations. 

 

The histogram for the Blue / Yellow contrast corresponds the best to how often each B / Y 

value was fixated. The correspondence between occurrences of different Red / Green 

contrast values to how often they were fixated seems lower, but a relation is still visible. On 

the other hand, there is little to no correspondence between the histogram showing the 

occurrence of different luminance contrast values and their fixation amounts.  

Hence, it seems that luminance contrast is a bad predictor for what is fixated in an image. 

Red / Green contrast is better and the Blue / Yellow contrast appears to be the best 

predicting factor.
