transparency. a, In conventional EIT in an
atomic system, a strong pump field ȣp is tuned to
an atomic energy transition (1–2) and creates a
‘transparency window’ for the signal field ȣs,
which is tuned to a second transition (1–3). 
b, Destructive interference between the two
absorption pathways results in a narrow spike of
increased transmission within a wider absorption
line. The refractive index of the material thus
varies rapidly over a narrow frequency range, and
the resulting increased dispersion can lead to
ultraslow propagation of light. The narrow spike
also provides a well-defined frequency marker
for precision measurements. c, In a system of
microresonators, studied by Xu et al.1, EIT occurs
because of destructive interference between two
fields, leaving two appropriately spaced rings in
the direction of the reflection port. The width of
the absorption feature is determined by the
overall loss of the ring resonator system (often
dominated by coupling to the straight
waveguide), whereas that of the transparency
window is set by the internal loss of the ring
resonators. (Part c adapted from ref. 1.)

whenever a whole number of wavelengths of
the incident light fits into the resonator. More-
over, destructive interference occurs between
light emerging from two coupled resonators. 
Early microresonators were simply aerosols
containing particles of varying sizes, but mod-
ern fabrication procedures produce individual
resonators with highly controllable resonance
frequencies4. These resonators come in various
forms: ring shapes; disks or spheres, in which
the light skims across the outer surface as sound
does in a ‘whispering gallery’; or less obvious
forms, such as defects in an otherwise perfect
photonic crystal. Their small size makes them
ideally suited to perform operations on light
analogous to those performed by components
702

of silicon chips on electrons, and numerous
applications have been proposed for them5–7.

Several methods5,8,9 for combining EIT and
optical  microresonators  to  obtain  EIT-like 
resonances in integrated optical systems were
proposed in 2004, and a laboratory demon-
stration of such an effect was published last
year10. In that experiment, EIT-like transmis-
sion spectra were observed in two interacting
microresonators in the form of glass spheres
approximately 400 micrometres in diameter
that supported resonances of the whispering-
gallery type. 

Xu et al.1 take this advance a stage further.
Using modern nanofabrication procedures,
they manufactured a pair of micro-ring res-
onators coupled to parallel waveguides on a
silicon-on-insulator  substrate  typical  of  an
electronic chip. The refractive index of the 
silicon that made up the waveguides and the
rings (3.45) was significantly greater than that
of the silicon oxide that surrounded them on
all sides (1.46). This meant that light could be
confined  in  rings  of  a  very  small  diameter
through the process known as total internal
reflection.  EIT-like  behaviour  was  demon-
strated by measuring the transmission at dif-
ferent frequencies of a laser beam injected into
the system. The authors constructed several
such devices, where the distance between the
micro-rings was varied from device to device,
and thus the spectral location of the EIT-like
transmission peak could be adjusted. 

So what good is all this? As the name indi-
cates,  EIT  is  primarily  a  way  of  rendering
transparent  an  otherwise  highly  absorbing
material, and so lends itself to applications
such  as  the  construction  of  long-distance 
optical  transmission  lines. The  dispersion
characteristic that results from EIT has already
allowed 
light’  propagation  to  be
achieved11–13 at speeds just a small fraction 
of the normal speed of light. Optical ‘buffers’
to  temporarily  store  light are  an  obvious 

‘slow 

application of such slow-light technology.

Perhaps most importantly, EIT resonances
can  be  much  narrower  than  those  of  indi-
vidual resonators, whether these are atoms or
microresonators. As a resonance frequency
can typically be measured only to an accuracy
given by some fixed fraction of the resonance
linewidth, narrowed linewidths could be use-
ful for performing precise optical measure-
ments  of  quantities  such  as  magnetic  field
strength14. The ability to synthesize such com-
ponents on an optical chip suggested by Xu
and colleagues’ innovation1 is a crucial step
towards the development of such integrated
optical devices.

NEUROBIOLOGY 

Extending influence

Eve Marder
Rather than merely firing in a digital on–off fashion, vertebrate neurons 
may have an analogue aspect to their signalling too — a finding that will not
surprise many who have worked on invertebrate neurons.

Much of what we know about electrical sig-
nalling in the brain comes from extracellular
recordings that detect when a neuron is firing
action  potentials.  These  recordings  do  not,
however, provide continuous monitoring of
the fluctuations of membrane potential, and 
do  not  capture  sub-threshold  changes  in 
membrane potential such as those caused by
individual synaptic events. The prevalence of

extracellular recordings in the literature has
contributed to a collective consciousness in
which the action potential or ‘spike’ is viewed
as  an  invariant,  all-or-nothing  stereotyped
event that occurs once a threshold membrane
potential is reached. This ‘digital’ signal carries
information from the neuronal cell body, the
soma, down the axon to presynaptic terminals,
where it evokes the release of neurotransmitter
