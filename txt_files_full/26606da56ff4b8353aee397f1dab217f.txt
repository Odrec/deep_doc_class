Generative Capacities
◦ Weak = Observational adequacy
◦  all and only grammatical sentences
◦ Strong = Descriptive adequacy
◦  assign syntactic structure

POS-tagging
◦ Rule-based, statistical 
◦  maximize P(word|tag) ∗ P(tag|n‐1 tags)
◦ Markov assumption, bigram

Parsing
◦ Top-down, bottom-up

only syntactically                      only trees that fit
correct sentences                     the input string

Human Parsing
◦ Minimal attachment principle
◦ Garden path effect
◦ Usually bottom-up but top-down influences
◦ Experiments with self-paced reading and eye-

tracking

CYK Algorithm

We want to make a chart that can tell 
us whether a certain string can be 
generated by a given grammar.

1. step: lexical fill (simply write the 
letters in the diagonal and assign a 
non-terminal to them)

… continue as follows

Simply follow these steps!

2. go through all fields for a string of length n  - begin with n=1 (the diagonal of all 
single words) 

3. for each field A-B, look at all pairs of 2 fields for which it holds that A-X & X-B 

◦ example: For field 0-4 (n=4), we need to consider the pairs  0-1 & 1-4; 0-2 & 2-4; 0-3 & 3-4 

4. if a non-terminal in A-X & a non-terminal in X-B can be generated by a non-
terminal, write this non-terminal in field A-B 

5. repeat all steps for n+1; do this until n = length of input 

 if field 0-input length contains S at the end, the    

string is correctly generated by the grammar and all  

non-terminals have been assigned 

Parsing-tree exercise

Make a parsing-tree of the following sentence:

The horse raced past the barn fell

a) Try top-down parsing

b) Try bottom-up parsing

Use NP, VP, PP, Det, V, N,…

Wrong or Right?

There are some animals that also speak languages.

Productivity means that human languages are not tied to here and now.

Prevarication means that human languages can be used to lie.

Arbitrariness means that human languages are symbolic.

Reﬂexiveness means that human languages can be used to discuss themselves.

There is no scientiﬁc study without idealization.

Are the following strings generated by the given regular expression?

• . +

• “EEEEEEE”
• “Blubb”
• “ε”

• (In|in)?dependen(t|ce)

• Independent
• independence
• Dependence
• dependen

Gets petted – gets petted – sees squirrels – gets petted – gets petted 

Sees squirrels – sees squirrels – gets petted – waits – sees squirrels – gets petted

Gets petted – gets petted – sees squirrels – gets petted – gets petted

Wrong or Right?

A formal language is the set of atomic symbols that belong to the language.

All characteristics of human language can be modelled as a formal language.

A formal language is a subset A ⊆ Σ∗ i.e., a (ﬁnite or inﬁnite) set of (ﬁnite) strings over Σ.

A property of concatenation is distributivity.

A property of concatenation is having an empty string ε.

“Although the cook does like to cook and cooks far better than other

cooks do, she cooks no longer.”

Count grammatical words, word forms and lexemes.

Wrong or Right?

Phonetics studies speech sounds independent of their role and function in language.

Phonetics only includes properties, which are linguistically relevant.

Segmentation and Individuation are used to individuate and identify speech sounds.

A token is a special instance of a type.

Phonology studies the sounds of particular languages considering their role and function in the 
particular language.

Basic elements of a language are called phones.

Which of these forms are regular, which are partial and which full suppletion?

go → goes
go → went
mouse → mice
abolish → abolished
be → am
keep → kept
sleep → slept
bad → worse

Wrong or Right?

Words are never stored individually in the mental lexicon.

If a string is phonologically admissible it can always be a word of a particular language.

Major categories are also known as lexical categories, content words or open-class words.

Even closed words carry meaning.

Wrong or Right?

Free morphemes can appear alone and bound morphemes need to appear with a free morpheme.

Free morphemes and Words are interchangeable. It practically means the same.

Morphemes are also called syllables.

Paradigms, Suppletion and Flocking are used by inﬂectional morphology.

In two-level morphology there are two mappings and diﬀerent levels of representations.

Allomorphy means that there are diﬀerent realizations of one morph.

Wrong or right?

When we use statistical POS tagging, we want to maximize the following formula: 

P(word|tag) ∗ P(tag|previous n − 1 tags)

P(tag|word) ∗ P(tag|previous n − 1 tags)

Wrong or Right?

Depending on the syntactic structure the meaning of an utterance can vary.

Descriptive adequacy describes grammars with the same constituent structures, which would help us to enumerate.

Including a lot of information in POS tags reduces the errors.

Looking up POS tags reduces ambiguity greatly.

The Markov Assumption says that we have to look at all of the preceding POS tags to tag correctly.

Which sentences can be generated by the following grammar?

S → NP VP
NP → PropN
NP → Det N
VP → V NP
VP → V PP
PP → P NP
Det → {the, a}
PropN → {John, Jane, Mary}
V → {sleeps, loves}
N → {cat, garden}
P → {in}

1 John loves Jane.
2 Mary loves the cat in the garden.
3 Peter sleeps the cat.
4 Jane sleeps the garden.

Parsing means to recognize the structure of a sentence and to assign a meaning to it.

Parsing means to recognize a string as a sentence and to assign a structure to it.

In Top-Down Parsing most of the trees generated are ungrammatical, but all of them work with the input.

In Bottom-Up Parsing most of the trees generated do not describe the input, but all of them are grammatical.

In Chart Parsing we split the problem into lots of tiny problems, which we solve one by one.

Wrong or Right?

Syntax combines the words from the lexicon into larger meaningful units in a non-rule-governed way.

There cannot be an algorithm for ﬁnding out whether a sentence is grammatical.

Regular grammars are too weak to describe the English language.

A constituent can always be replaced by words of the same type without loosing grammaticality.

There are many ways to identify a constituent. Pauses and fronting are two of them.

There are three types of syntactic constituents.

Wrong or Right?

A weak generative capacity of a grammar means that only a set of sentences is deﬁned.

A strong generative capacity of a grammar means that only a set of sentences is deﬁned.

The diﬀerence between regular grammars and phrase structure grammars lies in the production rules.

A Context-Free Grammar gives the possibility of grouping words into sentences.

In Chomsky Normal Form only one symbol is allowed to be on the right side of the arrow.
