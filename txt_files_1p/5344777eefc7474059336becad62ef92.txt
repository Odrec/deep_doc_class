Abstract

Background: Alu elements are major contributors to lineage-specific new exons in primate and human genomes.
Recent studies indicate that some Alu exons have high transcript inclusion levels or tissue-specific splicing profiles,
and may play important regulatory roles in modulating mRNA degradation or translational efficiency. However, the
contribution of Alu exons to the human proteome remains unclear and controversial. The prevailing view is that
exons derived from young repetitive elements, such as Alu elements, are restricted to regulatory functions and have
not had adequate evolutionary time to be incorporated into stable, functional proteins.
Results: We adopt a proteotranscriptomics approach to systematically assess the contribution of Alu exons to the
human proteome. Using RNA sequencing, ribosome profiling, and proteomics data from human tissues and cell
lines, we provide evidence for the translational activities of Alu exons and the presence of Alu exon derived
peptides in human proteins. These Alu exon peptides represent species-specific protein differences between
primates and other mammals, and in certain instances between humans and closely related primates. In the case of
the RNA editing enzyme ADARB1, which contains an Alu exon peptide in its catalytic domain, RNA sequencing
analyses of A-to-I editing demonstrate that both the Alu exon skipping and inclusion isoforms encode active
enzymes. The Alu exon derived peptide may fine tune the overall editing activity and, in limited cases, the site
selectivity of ADARB1 protein products.
Conclusions: Our data indicate that Alu elements have contributed to the acquisition of novel protein sequences
during primate and human evolution.

Background
Transposable elements have played important roles in
the evolution of gene regulation and function [1]. The
primate-specific Alu retrotransposon is
the most
abundant class of transposable elements in the human
genome, with over 1 million copies occupying over 10 %
of the human genomic DNA [2]. Although Alu elements
were historically considered as ‘junk DNA’, extensive re-
search in the past two decades has revealed significant
contributions of Alu to the evolution of the human
genome and gene regulatory networks [1–3].

Alu is a major contributor to de novo origination of
lineage-specific exons in primates [4]. Because the Alu
element contains multiple sites
resemble the
consensus donor and acceptor splice site signals, the in-
sertion of Alu elements into intronic regions of existing
genes produces preferable substrates for subsequent mu-
tations that create and establish new exons [4, 5]. The
exonization of Alu elements is frequent during primate
and human evolution – thousands of human genes con-
tain Alu-derived exon segments in their mRNA tran-
scripts [6, 7]. Although the majority of Alu exons have low
splicing activities and probably represent non-functional
evolutionary intermediates, a subset of Alu exons have
acquired ubiquitously strong or tissue-specific splicing ac-
tivities in human tissues, as demonstrated by recent tran-
scriptome studies using splicing-sensitive exon microarray
