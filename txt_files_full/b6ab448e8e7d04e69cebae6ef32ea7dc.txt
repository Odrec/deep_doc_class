Changes in Structure of the Tutorial 
 
Objectives 
• Maximize Person contact  hours with tutors 
•
• No Entry conditions for exam anymore 
• Rely on self-discipline and YOUR motivation  
• Transparency of learning material and goals 
•

Individualize the tutoring 

Learn at your own pace 
 

 
NEW Implementation  
 
We have tutorials that are as follows :  

• Twice a week – Monday 2-4 and Friday 8-10 
• Tutors will answer your question in smaller groups upon your request  
• During the tutorial we will collect important issues and will present them at the 

end of the tutorial for the entire group  

• We will upload all exercises including the solutions early in the semester – This 
allows you to learn at your own speed. BUT forces you to not only learn to copy 
the solutions if you want to really want to understand.  

 

 
 

Voltage-gated channels 

Two gate types of voltage-gated channels: 
 
• gates that activate or open a channel,  

 
 

  m(t) is the probability that an activation  
  gate is in the open state  
 
• gates that inactivate or close channels. 

 
 

  h(t) is the probability that an inactivation  
  gate is in the open state 
 
 
 
 
Persistent versus transient channels: 

 

• transient channel (a > 0  and b > 0) 
  inactivates automatically 

 

• persistent channel (b =0) 
  no automatic inactivation 

The Hodgkin-Huxley model 

Is the Hodgkin-Huxley model a good model ? 

 

• Yes, it is a wonderful model to understand the principles of spike-generation. 

 

• No, it isn’t a good model for predicting spikes, because it can hardly be fit to data: 

 

 

 

  The model has 11 parameters, and is nonlinearly dependent on 6 functions of V . 

Examples of the voltage 
dependent functions: 

See also the matlab code on the course webpage and CD: Run_Hodgkin_Huxley.m 

Izhikevich’ resonate and fire model 

A simple 2 dimensional model (see module 2 for details on the phase portraits) 

• It is based on a fast voltage variable V and a slow recovery variable u.  

 

 

 

• Original Hodgkin-Huxley: 

 

 

• Izhikevich model : 

 

 

 

• The Izhikevich model uses a quadratic approximation of the voltage dependence. 

• Sum of all slow currents are described by one recovery variable u.

Bifurcation 

Bifurcation theory is the mathematical 
study of changes in the qualitative or 
topological structure of a given family.  
 
Examples of such families are the 
integral curves of a family of vector 
fields, and the solutions of a family of 
differential equations.  
Most commonly applied to the 
mathematical study of dynamical 
systems, a bifurcation occurs when a 
small smooth change made to the 
parameter values (the bifurcation 
parameters) of a system causes a 
sudden 'qualitative' or topological 
change in its behaviour.[1] 
 
Bifurcations occur in both continuous 
systems (described by ODEs, DDEs or 
PDEs), and discrete systems (described 
by maps).  
 
Different types of bifurcations: 
• Saddle-node (fold) bifurcation 
• Transcritical bifurcation  
• Pitchfork bifurcation 
• Period-doubling (flip) bifurcation  
• Hopf bifurcation

Example Logistic map: 

 
 
 
 
 
The bifurcation diagram nicely shows 
the forking of the possible periods of 
stable orbits from 1 to 2 to 4 to 8 etc. 
Each of these bifurcation points is a 
period-doubling bifurcation. The ratio of 
the lengths of successive intervals 
between values of r for which bifurcation 
occurs converges to the first 
Feigenbaum constant. 
 

Bifurcation Diagram 
 

The bifurcation parameter r is shown on the 
horizontal axis of the plot and the vertical axis 
shows the possible long-term population values 
of the logistic function. Only the stable solutions 
are shown here, there are many other unstable 
solutions which are not shown in this diagram.
