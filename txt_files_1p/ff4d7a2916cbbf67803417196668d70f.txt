Abstract Since Flemming described a nuclear substance in
the nineteenth century and named it “chromatin,” this sub-
stance has fascinated biologists. What is the structure of
chromatin? DNA is wrapped around core histones, forming
a nucleosome fiber (10-nm fiber). This fiber has long been
assumed to fold into a 30-nm chromatin fiber and subsequent-
ly into helically folded larger fibers or radial loops. However,
several recent studies, including our cryo-EM and X-ray scat-
tering analyses, demonstrated that chromatin is composed of
irregularly folded 10-nm fibers, without 30-nm chromatin
fibers, in interphase chromatin and mitotic chromosomes.
This irregular folding implies a chromatin state that is physi-
cally less constrained, which could be more dynamic com-
pared with classical regular helical folding structures. Consis-
tent with this, recently, we uncovered by single nucleosome
imaging large nucleosome fluctuations in living mammalian
cells (∼50 nm/30 ms). Subsequent computational modeling
suggested that nucleosome fluctuation increases chromatin
accessibility, which is advantageous for many “target
searching” biological processes such as transcriptional regu-
lation. Therefore, this review provides a novel view on chro-
matin structure in which chromatin consists of dynamic and
disordered 10-nm fibers.

Introduction

There are 60 trillion cells in the human body. Each cell
contains 2 m of genomic DNA in a small nucleus with an
approximately 10-μm diameter (a volume of only ∼100 fL to
1 pL), and yet, it is able to search and read the information in
its genomic DNA to execute diverse cellular functions. There-
fore, it is important to understand how this long genomic
DNA is organized in the nucleus. In the nineteenth century,
W. Flemming described a nuclear substance that was clearly
visible after staining with a basic dye using primitive light
microscopes and named it “chromatin.” This is now thought
to be the basic unit of genomic DNA organization (Olins and
Olins 2003). Since then, even before the discovery of the
structure of DNA (Watson and Crick 1953), chromatin has
attracted significant interest from biologists. In this review
article, we assess the available data to provide a novel view
of chromatin in which “chromatin is a dynamic and disordered
10-nm fiber.”

DNA and nucleosomes

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a negatively charged poly-
mer that produces electrostatic repulsion between adjacent
DNA regions. Therefore, it would be difficult for a long
DNA molecule alone to fold into a small space like the
nucleus (Bloomfield 1996; Yoshikawa and Yoshikawa
2002). To overcome this problem, the long, negatively
charged polymer is wrapped around a basic protein complex
known as a core histone octamer, which consists of the histone
proteins H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, to form a nucleosome
(Fig. 1) (Olins and Olins 1974; Kornberg 1974; Woodcock
et al. 1976). The structure of a nucleosome is well known at
atomic resolution (1.9 Å) (Davey et al. 2002): 147 base pairs
(bp) of DNA are wrapped in 1.7 left-handed superhelical turns
