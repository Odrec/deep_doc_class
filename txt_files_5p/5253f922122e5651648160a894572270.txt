Abstract

We use a recent policy experiment in Rio de Janeiro, the installation of permanent police stations 
in low-income communities (or favelas), to quantify the relationship between a reduction in crime 
and the change in the prices of nearby residential real estate. Using a novel data set of detailed 
property prices from an online classiﬁ eds website, we ﬁ nd that the new police stations (called 
UPPs) had a substantial effect on the trajectory of property values and certain crime statistics since 
the beginning of the program in late 2008. We also ﬁ nd that the extent of inequality among resi-
dential prices decreased as a result of the policy. Both of these empirical observations are consis-
tent with a dynamic model of property value in which historical crime rates have persistent effects 
on the price of real estate.

Key words: wealth distribution, amenity value, real estate

Introduction 

Residential property prices are an important gauge of economic conditions writ large.  

They reflect many macroeconomic factors as well as the particular local microeconomy of the 
property’s location.  Home values also compose an important part of household wealth, 
especially in lower income areas where residential property is typically a family’s primary (or 
only) asset.  In the United States, about a third of total assets for a given family are accounted 
for by owner-occupied housing, with that figure closer to two thirds for families below the 
median level of net wealth.1  This statistic might be further skewed in developing countries, 
where the capacity of poor families to accumulate financial assets is more limited.  Taken 
together, these observations suggest a powerful mechanism by which any policy affecting the 
determinants of house prices can alter the level and dispersion of household wealth.    

In this paper, we investigate one example of this mechanism as it pertains to the 

connection between crime and house prices.  Our first objective is to empirically identify and 
document the relationship between crime and house prices.  As a public ‘bad,’ we fully expect 
crimes to exert a downward force on prices; indeed, this is a common finding in the related 
literature on house amenity valuation and the economics of conflicts.  We quantify the extent 
to which prices are responsive to crime-related outcomes, as demonstrated by a recent policy 
experiment and with the use of highly detailed property price data from the online classified 
website ZAP (www.ZAP.com.br), and find that these effects can be quite large and 
economically meaningful.  Our main innovation will then be to document and explain the 
distributional consequences of removing the public bad of crime; that is, the removal of crime 
may have heterogeneous effects on the prices of different residences in a manner which alters 
the degree of overall inequality among property values. This would happen, for example, if 
lower valued properties appreciate or depreciate disproportionately to a given change in the 
crime rate.  We will discuss the circumstances under which that would occur in the context of 
a dynamic model of property valuation.

2007, drawing on the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) compiled by the Federal Reserve Board.  Family net 
wealth and its components for various years of the SCF are provided in Table A2 of that paper.

Our empirical work will show that decreasing crime does, in fact, benefit lower valued 

properties disproportionately, reducing the inequality among properties.  This relationship is 
suggested in Figure 1, which plots indices of homicides, robberies and a Gini coefficient of 
house prices for the city of Rio de Janeiro since 2008.2  Both homicides and robberies 
declined markedly since mid-2009.  Though the series for homicides is more volatile, the 
average decrease for both types of crime is about 15 percent by mid-2011.  The Gini 
coefficient measures the level of inequality of house prices across Rio’s neighborhoods.  It 
was rather stable at roughly 0.28 through the beginning of 2010 before falling to 0.265 by 
mid-2011.  The fact that both crime and inequality pivoted and then fell at about the same 
time is suggestive of a relationship between them.   

Since there are many different factors that can affect house prices simultaneously, we 

study the housing market around the time of a specific policy event tightly linked to the 
objective of crime reduction.  This policy is the introduction of the Unidade Pacificadora da 
Policia (“Pacifying Police Unit,” or UPP) program in Rio de Janeiro beginning in late 2008.  
As in many metropolitan areas in developing countries, a significant fraction of the population 
of Rio live in very low-income communities with a high concentration of substandard, 
informal housing; in Rio, home to some of the largest of these communities in Latin America, 
they are called favelas.  Over the past three decades, the city has been plagued by conflicts 
over territory in its favelas with drug gangs and militias, with many favelas effectively being 
occupied and governed by the drug gangs. The UPP program, in response, re-occupies 
specific favelas by force using elite police units, drives out the drug gangs and roots out 
caches of weapons and drugs, and then installs permanent police stations staffed by highly 
trained, well-paid and newly-recruited officers; eighteen such stations have been installed 
since 2008.  The basic objective of re-occupation is the renewed assertion of the rule of law 
and the abatement of drug gang-related crimes.   

The program, to the extent it is effective, is responsible for many positive externalities 
associated with the accomplishment of these objectives.  Using detailed monthly data on 
residential property prices in Rio’s formal housing market, as well as on homicide and

and V.

robbery rates in each of Rio’s neighborhoods, we formally test the hypotheses that 
neighborhoods closer to a UPP station experienced larger than average decreases in crime and 
larger than average increases in house prices after the UPP was put into place.  In addition to 
the variation across neighborhoods and time, we exploit the staggered timing of the policy 
across the 18 UPPs by jointly estimating the individual effect of each one on house prices and 
crime.  We find that, conditional on a UPP being installed nearby, house and apartment sales 
prices increased by an average of 5-10 percent, homicides decreased by an average of 10-25 
percent, and robberies decreased by an average of roughly 10-20 percent.  To gain perspective 
on the economic significance of the decrease in crime due to the UPPs, we use our regression 
results to construct counterfactual price and crime rates and, with those, city-wide statistics.  
In the absence of the UPPs, the overall house price index in Rio would have grown about 15 
percent slower since 2008, and homicide and robbery rates would have fallen by about 14 and 
20 percent less than they did, respectively.  We note that since we do not observe house prices 
inside the favelas themselves, our estimated price effects are quite likely to be underestimates 
of the true city-wide effects.   

The empirical results, notwithstanding some heterogeneity in the effectiveness of 
individual UPP stations, confirm widely reported anecdotes of abated violence and of 
skyrocketing residential property prices in the formal housing markets surrounding the 
favelas.  Our findings complement and extend previous work on the effectiveness of the 
UPPs.  Based on household survey data, Neri (2011a) found that rental prices within all 
favelas in Rio rose by about 7 percent between 2007 and 2009.  However, those results are not 
specific to each community protected by a UPP and do not control for secular trends in the 
Rio housing market.  The positive externalities of UPPs are also explored in Cunha and Mello 
(2011), which focuses on the formalization of services provision in a favela following the 
installation of a UPP.  In addition to the direct valuation of disamenities due to crime that we 
emphasize below, formalization and urban regularization are other important channels 
through which crime reductions affect property prices, and which are captured in our 
estimates of the effect of the UPPs. 

Having established that the UPPs influenced crime and house prices in opposite directions 

(that is, that the UPPs seem to be a reasonable instrument for the effect of crime on house 

 

3 

prices), we use our estimates to analyze the association between crime and the dispersion of 
house prices.  We present a model of property valuation in which there are diminishing 
returns to crime reduction; this implies that properties with either high initial crime rates or 
low amenity values have disproportionately large increases in price for a given decline in 
crime which, in turn, lowers inequality among properties.  The mechanism in the model that 
gives rise to diminishing returns is the inclusion of historical crime rates as a determinant of 
current property values.   

This treatment of the dynamic transmission of crime rates into house prices is quite 

similar in spirit to the way Besley and Mueller (2011) model the number of killings due to 
conflict as a function of the latent state of the peace process in Northern Ireland.  In that 
model, the persistence of crime in a particular area has a bearing on what signal agents take 
from a change in the number of killings about the probability of entering a state of peace, and 
hence on the transmission of the rate of killings into house prices. In our model, we have a 
simpler treatment of agents' expectations but the transmission of a change in the crime rate 
into prices depends similarly on the history of crime, which is an additional state variable.  
Thus, current and future consumption flows from housing depend on both the level and 
duration of crime rates in the past; lower initial crime rates with low historical duration gives 
rise to the biggest increases in price when the crime rate declines. 

We document that the disparity in house prices in Rio did in fact decline following the 

implementation of the UPP policy.  A Gini coefficient constructed with the actual and 
counterfactual house prices described above shows that the disparity in house prices across 
neighborhoods has been falling faster after installation of the UPPs than for the counterfactual 
Gini.  Moreover, in several neighborhoods with a UPP nearby, we find evidence that the 
dispersion in property prices within those neighborhoods narrowed, suggesting that even 
within more homogeneous sets of properties the lowest valued ones are most sensitive to a 
change in the crime rate. 

This paper contributes to several areas of active research, ranging from studies of the 

economics of conflict to the analysis of the wealth distribution.  Most closely related are the 
works identifying the impact of crime and violence on property prices, with the paper by 
Besley and Mueller (2011) as a closest antecedent; as below, Besley and Mueller (2011)

exploit both spatial and temporal variation in crime data to identify the effect on house prices, 
and they provide a model in which the response of property prices depends on the level and 
persistence of historical crime rates.  The present study uses more disaggregate price data, at 
the level of neighborhoods in Rio, and has a different modeling approach that focuses more 
on the implications of crime for the dispersion of house prices.  To our knowledge, ours is the 
first study to draw a connection between crime reduction and wealth inequality.  

Our empirical measurement of the crime elasticity of house prices is connected to a 
sequence of papers estimating this (largely negative) elasticity.  Early examples include 
Thaler (1978), in which a one standard deviation increase in per capita property crime 
decreased single-family home prices by 3 percent, and Hellman and Naroff (1979), in which 
the elasticity was -0.63.  A known drawback of these estimates is that they each treated the 
crime rate as exogenous, which may have biased the elasticity estimates if, for example, crime 
occurs disproportionately in poorer neighborhoods with low property values or, conversely, if 
criminals target areas with higher-priced homes.  In a recent survey, Ihlanfeldt and Mayock 
(2009) found 12 instances in of a set of 18 empirical studies relating house prices and crime 
that treat crime as exogenous – as such, those studies do not account for this reverse causality 
or other sources of endogeneity.  Of the recent studies that do instrument for crime, Gibbons 
(2004) and Tita, Petras and Greenbaum (2006) again find a negative significant relationship, 
an effect that is particularly pronounced for violent crimes. 

We attempt to get around issues of cross-sectional endogeneity by exploiting the time 

variation around an exogenous policy experiment, the UPPs in Rio.  A widely acknowledged 
objective of the UPP policy is to increase the safety around key venues for the 2014 soccer 
World Cup and 2016 Summer Olympics, the locations of which are not systematically related 
to historical crime rates or the levels of property prices.  As such, we will argue that the UPPs 
are a reasonable instrument for the effect of crime on house prices. We proceed by estimating 
a difference in differences estimator of property values in neighborhoods with a nearby UPP, 
straddling the public announcement that a UPP would be installed in those neighborhoods.  
This method for estimating the (dis)amenities of housing is used analogously in Linden and

Rockoff (2008) in their study of the effect of the proximity of registered sex-offenders on 
house prices.3 

Finally, this paper is related to a large literature on the determinants of wealth inequality.  
Wolff (1992) illustrates that wealth concentration and inequality in the United States varied a 
lot over much of the 20th century (both increasing and decreasing) and moved fairly closely 
with changes in the income distribution.  Brazil, in particular, has made great strides recently 
to reduce its level of inequality.4  Our work demonstrates a novel and potentially important 
channel by which policy can contribute to changes in the distribution of wealth.5 

The paper proceeds as follows.  The next section provides some background on the 

favelas in Rio and the official mandate of the UPP program.  Section II describes the 
empirical model, followed by the details of the property price data and crime data in Section 
III, and the empirical results in Section IV.  The valuation model and its predictions for the 
dispersion of house prices, as well as some empirical measures of house price inequality in 
Rio, can be found in Section V.  Section VI concludes.  

 

I.  Background on the UPP program 

Most of Rio de Janeiro’s favelas are situated on the hillsides of the city and many are 

located in close proximity to affluent neighborhoods. Both of these factors have made them a 
favored haven for drug gangs. By commanding the high ground and through a mix of 
cooptation and explicit threats, heavily-armed gangs have gained effective control over the 
resident populations of certain favelas and have used these locations as bases to process, 
stockpile and distribute drugs.  The profitability of such trafficking operations has led to 

                                                            
3 There are many other studies that estimate property (dis)amenities more broadly defined to include factors such 
as environment.  Boyle and Kiel (2001) provide a thorough, if dated, survey of that literature. 
4 Since 2001 the Gini coefficient for Brazil’s income distribution has decreased monotonically from 0.596 in 
2001 to an estimated 0.53 in 2010 – still relatively high compared to 0.36 for India or 0.42 for the U.S. For a 
recent discussion, see Neri (2011b). 
5 Though our results suggest that crime reductions have benefited the owners of low-priced housing 
disproportionately, low-wealth households are less likely to own a home than wealthier households.  In a recent 
study of U.S. households during the financial crisis, Bricker et al. (2011) show that household wealth declined 
most severely in the upper percentiles.  This reflects both the dramatic fall in house (and other asset) prices and 
the fact that wealthier families are more likely to own those assets.  In the bottom quartile of wealth, only 15 
percent of families had any home equity in 2007, compared to 96.8 percent in the top quartile.

intensifying territorial dispute, growing levels of violence and, through bribes to “protect” the 
operation from other drug gangs and other illicit activities, the increasing complicity of the 
police. Over the past three decades, a complex system has crystallized in which drug-related 
and other criminal activities have fed on police corruption, and spilled over into the political 
arena, with drug money used to finance politicians in the municipal and state legislatures, and 
reportedly reaching the highest levels of the state government.  

A new, reformist state government assumed power in 2007, setting improving security 

and reducing the levels of violence as priorities. The selection of Brazil as the host of the 
2014 World Cup and Rio as the seat of the 2016 Olympics added impetus to these objectives.  
The new government recognized that achieving these goals entailed dealing simultaneously 
with the territorial power of drug lords in the favelas as well as police corruption.  There was 
also a realization that a new security policy for the favelas would have to be more permanent 
in nature.  Previous attempts to combat drug traffic involved occasional incursions into the 
favelas for specific operations, often resulting in the deaths of innocent bystanders caught in 
the crossfire.  The core of the new policy, which took nearly two years to design and deploy, 
was built round the concept of territorial occupation by state forces, and the installation of a 
large, permanent presence of a newly trained police force of young officers untainted by 
corruption.6  This presence would manifest itself in a large police station, a UPP, and would 
be preceded by a carefully planned and swiftly executed process of expulsion of the drug 
gangs by crack police units and special forces.  The program, initiated in December 2008, is 
considered to be a new paradigm of police action against the encroachment of drug gangs in 
the favela communities.7  

Of the many favelas affected by drug gangs, the selection of which favelas were to receive 

a UPP was largely a political outcome.  This is important for our empirical identification of 
the effect of UPPs on crime and house prices, since it mitigates the extent of reverse causality 

                                                            
6 Breaking with traditional repression techniques, newly trained officers are taught to be “community policemen” 
or “proximity police” by integrating themselves within the occupied community. Acknowledging the skepticism 
and mistrust that local populations have historically had with police activity, all UPP staff are newly admitted 
and trained for this specific purpose. This hiring and training practice is consistent with the idea that UPPs are 
meant to be the gateway for many other services beyond the suppression of criminal activity. 
7 In an op-ed in the newspaper Globo, State Public Safety Secretary José Mariano Beltrame compared the UPP 
program (which he manages) to the Plano Real in 1994, which drastically reduced inflation and stabilized the 
economy (http://oglobo.globo.com/opiniao/apenas-primeiro-passo-3516738).

between our policy variable (the UPP) and each outcome.  In other words, UPPs were not 
simply placed in the neighborhoods with the highest crime rates or lowest house prices.  
Rather, the policy has been implemented by prioritizing important locations for the World 
Cup and Olympic Games, giving geographic factors a dominant role in determining the 
location of UPPs.  This can be seen in the top panel of Figure 2, in which the exact locations 
of the 18 existing UPPs are mapped with the gradient of average apartment sales prices for 
each neighborhood in Rio.  It is evident that some UPPs were placed in high-priced 
neighborhoods while others were placed in low-priced neighborhoods.  Similarly for the rate 
of homicides, shown in the bottom panel of Figure 2, UPPs appear in some low homicide 
neighborhoods in the south zone, high homicide neighborhoods in the north zone, and 
neighborhoods with intermediate homicide rates in the west.  Media commentary on the UPPs 
has suggested that while some neighborhoods received a UPP due to their high incidence of 
crime, UPPs were installed to garner political support for the UPP program and protect key 
World Cup locations in the high- and middle-income South Zone (or Zona Sul).8 

Implementation of a UPP in a given favela occurs in a four-stage process.  A similar 

protocol has been observed for most favelas, though it is not an official standard.  First, the 
community or set of communities to be occupied is announced by the police up to 6 months in 
advance, though no specific date is given. Second, a series of announcements indicating the 
imminence of the occupation occur, including an announcement that it will happen in the next 
1-2 weeks.  Between 4-7 days prior to the occupation, the specific date is made public and 
police begin encircling the favela(s). Third, heavily-armed Civil and Military Police, led by 
elite forces, invade a favela in the early twilight hours and expel the drug traffickers in the 
neighborhood.  Over the next few days of week, they systematically sweep the area to clear 
any remaining criminals or contraband and set up a temporary station.  Finally, the permanent 
physical station is installed and control is handed over to a new UPP battalion.  In the 
majority of cases, and as an intended consequence of the pre-announcements, this process has 
led to very little violent confrontation as criminals have already left the area.  
                                                            
8 Several sources indicate that geography rather than crime rate is the dominant factor in determining the location 
of UPPs.  In an interview in January 2012, the director of communication for the state police force, Frederico 
Caldas, linked expanding the number of police at UPPs with the goal of ensuring security ahead of the World 
Cup and Olympic Games.  A prime example of this goal is the invasion of Rocinha, Vidigal and Chacara do Céu 
in the affluent (relatively low-crime) South Zone of Rio, an operation which is widely cited for protecting tourist 
infrastructure.

As shown in Table 1, 20 favelas have been occupied and 18 UPP units installed between 
late-2008 and the end of 2011, as part of a plan to reach 40 UPPs by 2014. The rollout of the 
program has been fairly steady over time, with a new occupation taking place on average 
every few months.9  The territorial footprint of the current 18 UPPs encompasses over 50 
communities, containing more than half of a million inhabitants. Over 3 thousand police 
officers are currently deployed in the program, which is expected to reach 12 thousand by 
2014.10  Table 1 also shows the names of the neighborhood (or bairro) in which the favelas 
are located.  In some instances, due to their sprawling layout over hillsides, they are located in 
more than one neighborhood; for example, the favela Santa Marta is located in Botafogo and 
Humaitá.  Due to the large number and proximity of the neighborhoods (there are 153 official 
bairros in the municipality of Rio), we also list those which have a border within 2km of the 
address of each UPP; this significantly widens the number of neighborhood and the size of the 
population classified as ‘close’ to a UPP.  Finally, cognizant of the fact that one neighborhood 
might share a border with another where a UPP is located but only have a small fraction of its 
population living close to the border, we use ArcGIS mapping software to compute the 
distance between each UPP and the central point (called ‘centroid’) in each bairro.  The set of 
neighborhoods with a centroid within 2km of a UPP station is a subset of those with a border 
within 2km, and is used below as another measure of UPP proximity. 

 

II.  Estimating the effect of UPPs on property prices and crime rates 

Our baseline measure of the effect of the UPPs is a difference in differences estimator for 
all of the 18 UPPs installed between November 2008 and November 2011.11  Our elemental 

                                                            
9 When available in media reports, Table 1 includes the date that the UPP was announced, though in many 
instances these dates, if reported, were only a few days prior to occupation.  Since the announcement data are not 
published officially, we rely on media reports to ascertain their timing; newspaper coverage tends to pick up the 
story of a UPP only once invasion is imminent (i.e., shortly before the third stage described above). 
10 In addition, as of the date of this manuscript, the cluster of favelas known as Complexo do Alemão, containing 
approximately 125,000 inhabitants, was occupied by 3,000 highly trained army troops, while another immense 
tract of communities in Rocinha, Vidigal and Chácara do Céu, occupied in November 2011, had an unknown 
number of crack units still searching for drugs and weapons. 
11 Two large clusters of communities, Complexo do Alemão and Rocinha/Vidigal, are excluded as no UPP was 
installed yet by the end of 2011 (as of January 2012, two new UPPs were established in Vidigal and Chácara do 
Céu, to be followed by Rocinha).  Given significant differences in the size and scope of those UPPs, it is difficult 
to apply our findings for the first 18 UPPs to them (or, for that matter, to subsequent UPPs).  However, under the 

 

9 

unit of measure is the monthly average listing price of a property with certain characteristics, 
such as dwelling type (i.e., apartment or house) and number of bedrooms, in a given 
neighborhood.  For instance, one price observation would be the average price of a 3-bedroom 
apartment in Botafogo in January 2010.  The localized nature of the policy in specific favelas 
as well as its sequential rollout leads to variation in property prices across neighborhoods, 
time and property characteristics.  The elasticity of house prices to the installation of a UPP is 
estimated using the following specification:

and aggregate month-to-month variation in the housing market, respectively.  Since the 
average prices of properties in the same bairro but with different characteristics might have 
correlated errors, the standard errors of the estimates are clustered by bairro and period. 

Our treatment group consists of properties that are in neighborhoods within close 

proximity of a UPP.  Ideally, one would use the exact distance between a property’s address 
and the UPP as the measure of proximity.  However, given that we observe property prices 
only within the geographic unit of neighborhood, we operate under a range of assumptions 
about how ‘close’ adjacent neighborhoods are to a UPP.  A set of three specifications of the 
variable 

 is used: (i) the neighborhood in which the UPP is located (the penultimate

column of Table 1), (ii) neighborhoods with a border within 2km of the UPP address (the final 
column of Table 1), and (iii) neighborhoods whose centroid is within 2km of the UPP address.   

                                                                                                                                                                                          
assumption that subsequent UPPs are on average as effective as previous ones, our estimates of the overall effect 
of UPPs on house prices and crime understate the effects of the program as a whole.

The influence of each UPP on house prices is given by the coefficients 

n,3 , the 

interaction between

 and 

nUPP .  

n,3  can be interpreted as the percent increase in 

average property prices in neighborhoods proximate to a UPP after its installation relative to 
the change in price for properties that are not located close to a UPP.  We identify the separate 
contribution of 15 out of 18 UPPs to house prices.  In three instances, the overlap of the 
timing or the neighborhood of multiple UPPs is such that the effect of each UPP cannot be 
separately identified. For example, the occupation of the favela in São Carlos (in the 
neighborhoods Estácio and Rio Comprido) was announced in February 2011, the same month 
as favelas in Coroa, Fallet and Fogueteiro (in the neighborhood Rio Comprido).  The resulting 
n,3 .  We did likewise for 
colinearity led us to merge these two UPPs into a single estimate of 

Borel, Formiga and Salgueiro, three UPPs in the Tijuca neighborhood introduced within 
months of one another in 2010.   

An important concern about the use of average price changes (of a sample of listings) to 

measure trends in the housing market is that the composition or quality of the sample could be 
changing over time.  Changing property composition, such as the entry of a high-quality, 
high-priced property into the listings, would affect the average price used in the estimation of 
(1) even if the true quality-adjusted price of housing had not changed.  This is a relevant issue 
if composition is changing systematically in a way that is correlated with the timing of the 
UPP policy.  It is therefore important to check whether housing composition might be 
changing in response to the introduction of UPPs and to correct for this selection bias in 
equation (1).  To do so, we use the two-stage correction procedure by Heckman (1976, 1979) 
and estimate the probability that a property with certain characteristics (i.e., neighborhood, 
type, # rooms) is listed.  The first stage probit regression is of the form:

In (2), the treatment group is additionally interacted with the total number of property listings 
on ZAP.com.br in the state of Rio de Janeiro.  We thus allow listings to be a function of all of 
the explanatory variables in (1), including the UPP policy, as well as any factors that affect 
the aggregate listings on ZAP.com.br.  Stated differently, the first stage allows for the 
possibility that crime has an outsized influence on listings when other factors affecting listings 
are high.  We implement (2) as a standard Heckman correction factor by adding the inverse 
Mills ratio of this regression as an additional explanatory variable in (1).   

We note that the sample selection correction, while useful as a gauge for the determinants 

of listings for groups of properties (e.g., 2- versus 3-bedroom apartments in Botafogo), still 
does not account for compositional effects within those groups (e.g., high- versus low-quality 
2-bedroom apartments in Botafogo).  These compositional effects might be tainting our 
results below, though it is not obvious whether one would expect a decrease in crime induced 
by the UPPs to cause higher- or lower-quality properties within each group to be listed.   

Finally, estimates of the UPP effect on house prices from equations (1) and (2) are used to 

construct a series of counterfactual average property prices; these are the prices that the 
regressions suggest would have been observed in the absence of the UPP policy.  The growth 

rate of the counterfactual price, 

tP~ , in a given period is constructed as follows:

III.  House prices and crime data 

This section describes the sources of detailed property price and crime data for the city of 

Rio.  

a)  ZAP.com.br price data 

Real estate prices are drawn from the ‘imóveis’ section of the online classifieds website, 

ZAP.   We were provided with a confidential extract from the ZAP database containing 
average monthly offer prices of real estate in Rio for the period March 2007 through August 
2011.  Each observation is the simple average of prices across listings with specific 
characteristics such as neighborhood, type of property and number of rooms.  Prices are in 
units of Brazilian reais per square meter.  We were also provided with the number of listings 
and the standard deviation of the listing prices for each observation.  

 

13 

Altogether, the extract contains 54,064 monthly price observations of apartments and 
houses for sale spanning all 153 neighborhoods in Rio.  Underlying these observations are 
3,302,036 individual property listings.  The numbers of neighborhoods, property types and 
transaction types have been growing steadily over the course of the sample (that is, the panel 
is unbalanced), which likely reflects the growth of ZAP as an advertising service provider, 
and not necessarily the number of properties bought and sold in the real estate market over 
time.  Table 2 summarizes the average listing prices by property type and number of rooms, 
with the average prices at the of the bottom panel weighted by the number of listings 
underlying each observation.  A few patterns in the composition of the data are worth noting.  
First, about three quarters of the listings are apartments.  Second, for both apartments and 
houses, the price observations are fairly evenly distributed across properties with 1 through 4 
bedrooms, with roughly 10-20 percent of the observations fitting into each one of those 
categories.  Third, particularly in the weighted statistics, there are large differences in price 
levels across property types; house prices per square meter of R$2,846 are a full third lower 
than apartment prices. And fourth, the price per square meter tends to increase with the 
number of bedrooms for apartments and houses, notwithstanding a relatively high price level 
for 1-bedroom apartments in the sample. 

The richness of the dataset is further demonstrated by the large numbers of listings in most 
neighborhoods, with even the 100th largest bairro by number of listings containing over 1,000 
listings over the sample period.  There is also a fair amount of heterogeneity among wealthy 
and poorer neighborhoods, with the average property price in the most expensive 
neighborhood of almost 9,000 reais per square meter dwarfing the average price of 1,300 in 
the least expensive. 

Interestingly, looking at the raw price data already suggests some effect of the UPPs on 

property prices.  Figure 3 shows one such example for the average price of houses in the 
neighborhoods Leme and Copacabana.  The vertical lines show the announcement dates of 
two UPPs, the first directly adjacent to formal communities in Leme and the second abutting 
Copacabana and Ipanema.  Immediately following the announcement of Chapéu-Mangueira 
in Leme, house prices jumped by about one third in Leme and only edged upwards slightly in 
Copacabana.  Conversely, after the occupation of Pavão-Pavãozinho in Copacabana, house 

 

14 

prices jumped by over 25 percent in Copacabana and stayed roughly flat in Leme.  It is 
precisely price responses like these that our difference in differences estimator will attribute to 
the UPPs; in each case, the bairro containing the UPP (the treatment group) increased relative 
to the other (the control) after the occupation of the favela.  A more subtle, and more 
common, case is illustrated in Figure 4, showing the average apartment prices in four 
neighborhoods as well as vertical lines denoting the occupations of the aforementioned 
favelas.  One difference in Figure 4 is that the prices all have secular upward trends and so the 
difference in differences estimator will attribute to the UPPs increases in the slope of the 
treatment group price index relative to the control group indices after the installation of each 
UPP.  Another difference in Figure 4 is the inclusion of prices for Botafogo and Leblon, 
neighborhoods that share a border with Copacabana and Ipanema, respectively.  The inclusion 
of these neighborhoods in the treatment group (or not) will clearly have a bearing on the 
measured price effects of the UPPs in this example.  We will consider both cases below. 

 

b)  ISP crime data 

The crime data are compiled by the Institute of Public Safety of Rio de Janeiro (the 

Instituto de Segurança Pública do Rio de Janeiro, or ISP).  ISP is responsible for 
consolidating and publishing an array of official statistical data pertaining to public safety.  
The crime data that we use are drawn originally from incident reports written by the state civil 
police and then aggregated into groups of different types of crime;12 the assignment of 
incidents to categories of crime undergoes quality control checks by the civil police’s internal 
affairs department.  From these counts of different crime types in each month from January 
2007 to June 2011, we construct two aggregates: homicides and robberies.  Homicides is an 
aggregate of incident counts for three crime classifications related to violent acts with the  
intent to kill: murder, attempted murder and vehicular homicide.  Robberies is an aggregate of 
incident counts for the following crime classifications: robbery of a commercial 
establishment, robbery of a residency, robbery of a vehicle, robbery of a passer-by, robbery of 

                                                            
12 The categories of crime use are standardized groups defined by the National Secretary of Public Safety 
(SENASP). 

 

15 

a bank, robbery of an ATM, robbery where the victim is driven to a financial institution, 
extortion, kidnapping, extortion through kidnapping, and embezzlement. 

The geographic unit of measure for the crime statistics is the coverage area of specific 

police stations, called delegacias de polícia, or DP.  There are forty DPs in the metropolitan 
area of Rio, with most of them covering more than one neighborhood (the level of 
aggregation for the ZAP property prices), and a small number that only cover a portion of one 
neighborhood. Each DP, in turn, is classified within a broader geographic unit called an 
Integrated Area of Public Safety, or AISP.13  To compute crime rates, we divide the crime 
counts for each DP by the corresponding monthly AISP population data.14   

Figure 5 shows the relationship between our two measures of the crime rate and average 

sale prices for apartments.  Each point is the average crime rate and property price for a 
particular neighborhood, averaging across time periods.  As seen in the top panel, homicide 
rates range from 4 to 188 homicides per 100,000 people per year, while average robbery rates 
vary from 48 to 4,333 per 100,000 people per year. For both crimes, the distribution is 
positively skewed, with most neighborhoods having low rates and only a few having very 
high rates. Turning to the correlation between crime and apartment prices, the figures 
demonstrate that having a low crime rate is necessary though not sufficient for a 
neighborhood to have a high average property price; while there are no neighborhoods with a 
high crime rate and a high property price, there are several neighborhoods with low crime and 
low price.  One might surmise from this observation that crime is but one amenity affecting 
property prices, which only becomes a dominant price-determining factor at very high rates. 

The triangles in Figure 5 show the neighborhoods where one or more of the UPPs are 

located.  It is worth noting that the UPP stations are located in neighborhoods that vary along 

                                                            
13 The official concordance between neighborhoods, DP’s and AISP’s can be found at the following website: 
http://urutau.proderj.rj.gov.br/isp_imagens/Uploads/RelacaoAISP.pdf. 
14 We note that the computation of neighborhood-level crime statistics using DP- and AISP-level statistics 
introduces some imprecision into our measure of the incidence of crime.  Specifically, each neighborhood is 
assumed to have the crime data reported by its DP.  This biases the crime statistics upwards as each 
neighborhood within a DP is erroneously assigned some crimes from other neighborhoods that share their DP.  
On the other hand, the population data are only available at the AISP level, which typically consist of multiple 
DP’s. By assuming that each neighborhood has the population level of its entire AISP, the crime rate statistic is 
biased downward.  On balance, the average crime rates that we compile are somewhat below their more 
aggregate published counterparts, though only slightly.

both dimensions.  The stations have been built in low and high crime neighborhoods, as well 
as in neighborhoods with low and high average property prices.  The square in each panel 
shows the average price and crime rate for the entire municipality of Rio, weighting each 
neighborhood by its average AISP population over the course of the sample. The average 
price for an apartments is R$2,152 per square meter, lower than the weighted average price by 
listings computed in Table 2, while the average crime rates are 27 and 538 incidents per 
100,000 people per year for homicides and robberies, respectively. Despite the more 
aggregate data that we use to construct neighborhood crime rates, the average homicide rate 
falls within the range (albeit on the low end) of the 42 and 27 homicides per 100,000 rate 
reported by Waiselfisz (2011) for the city as a whole in 2007 and 2010, respectively.15 

 
IV.  Results 

Estimates of 

n,3  are shown in Table 3 for five different specifications of the property 
price regressions.  Each column contains 15 coefficients for the interaction term of the UPP 
time dummy and proximity measure, one for each UPP station with certain UPPs pooled as 
described above.  The baseline specification, (I), is an OLS regression of equation (1) where 
the proximity measure is the neighborhood(s) in which the favela receiving the UPP is 
located.  We find that 11 of 15 coefficients on the difference in differences term are positive 
and statistically significant compared to two coefficients which were negative and significant. 
An F-test of the hypothesis that the sum of 

n,3  is zero is strongly rejected and the sum of 
price effects divided by the 18 UPP stations is 5.8 percent.  In other words, conditional on 
being in the neighborhood of a UPP, property prices increased by 5.8 percent more than in the 
rest of the city after the UPP was announced.  There is also a fair amount of heterogeneity in 
the price responses across UPPs, from 6 percent following the Batam UPP to the 21 percent 
jump following the Chapéu-Mangueira UPP. 

The estimates of price effects and their distribution across UPPs in (I) are quite stable 

across estimation methodologies.  Column (II) shows estimates of equation (1) using 
                                                            
15 A closer analogue to public homicide statistics is the aggregate of DP’s (instead of neighborhoods) using a 
narrower definition of homicide (excluding attempted murder and vehicular manslaughter).  Doing so with the 
ISP data yields an estimate of 31 homicides per 100,000 per year over the sample period.

weighted least squares and the number of listings per observation as weights.  The intuition 
for this choice of weights is that observations with very few underlying listings may be more 
prone to measurement error than those where many properties are listed.  To further control 
for the fact that the number of listings per observation could be endogenous to the UPP 
policy, we use the total number of listings in 2008 (on the eve of the UPP policy) for each 
bairro-type-# rooms observation, holding this constant throughout.  The average effect of a 
UPP increases to almost 10 percent, with 12 positive and significant estimates and only 1 
negative and significant one.   

An even more careful treatment of possible selection effects into the ZAP listing sample 
models the probability of a given type of observation having non-zero listings, as in equation 
(2).  Column (III) shows the results of the two stage procedure using the Heckman correction 
factor.  In the first-stage selection regression, an F-test with null-hypothesis 

 is

rejected and

.  In other words, the types of properties with positive numbers of 

listings in the treatment group vary systematically with the aggregate ZAP listings in the 
dataset.  Moreover, the estimate of rho, which is the correlation between the errors of the 
selection and outcome (second-stage) equations is statistically greater than zero, which 
suggests that a sample selection model befits the price data.  Applying the correction factor, 
the resulting marginal effects of the UPP are shown in column (III), and are not substantially 
different from their OLS analogues in column (I). 

The estimates of price effects are also robust to alternative specifications of the treatment 

group, though these changes in specification have a bearing on the interpretation of the 
magnitudes of the resulting estimates.  Columns (IV) reports the UPP price effects for 
neighborhoods with a border within 2 kilometers of each UPP station, respectively, estimated 
using weighted least squares.16  Strikingly, the inclusion of many more neighborhoods in the 
treatment group (relative to (II)) yields estimates that, although lower than before, are still 
positive and very significant. In column (IV), 13 of 15 UPPs have a positive and significant 
coefficient.  Additionally, the variation in the size of price effects across UPPs has gone 

                                                            
16 In the cases of pooled UPPs, the treatment group includes all bairros with borders within 2km of any of the 
pooled stations.

down, with the majority of estimates in the range of 5 to 10 percent.  It is intuitive that the 
level of the effect would decrease when spread across a larger geographic area.  This 
phenomenon is illustrated rather dramatically by Chapéu-Mangueira; the border estimate, 
which includes Copacabana, Urca and Botafogo in the treatment group (in addition to Leme), 
is less than half the size of the bairro-based estimate.  On the other hand, precisely because the 
effect is applied to a much larger geographic base of listings, it may well have a larger overall 
influence on Rio house prices.  Our counterfactual price series below will be informative of 
which specification implies a larger effect on the overall price index.   

Finally, column (V) shows the results for bairros with a centroid within 2km of a UPP 
station.  While the average effect of 5.7 percent is in line with the other specifications, on a 
UPP-by-UPP basis results tended to vary without much discernable pattern.  In some 
instances, the effects were in between those of columns (II) and (IV) as one might expect 
from the addition of an intermediate number of bairros into the treatment group.  In others, the 
results were notably stronger or weaker.  In sum, while the average effect held fairly steady at 
upwards of 5 percent, the disparities across UPPs varied from specification to specification. 

To put the overall effect of the UPP policy into perspective, we translate the results of 
each specification into counterfactual measures of house price growth rates as described in 
equation (3), then aggregate across property types for the entire city of Rio as follows:

where the weight 

ibw2008  is the total number of listings for property type i in bairro b during the 
year 2008.  The average observed price level for house and apartment sales in the city of Rio 
is illustrated by the solid red line in Figure 6.  The price level rose approximately 100 percent 
between January 2008 and August 2011 and, notwithstanding methodological and data input 
differences, our computed index is in the ballpark (though below) published figures of a 130 
percent increase in sales price for the city of Rio over the same period.17  

                                                            
17 FIPEZAP, an organization that publishes aggregate price indexes based on the same underlying data that we 
use here (Rio is one of several regions for which FIPEZAP publishes an index), has a different way of 
aggregating across types of property and bairros.  While the index formula we use is the same (i.e., a weighted 
average of the levels of price observations) FIPEZAP uses household income data from the 2000 census to 
weight across geographic areas and number of rooms.  In the absence of those weights, we use the number of

We will focus on the change in overall average counterfactual prices (computed in the 

same manner) relative to the observed aggregate.  Each of the counterfactual series in Figure 
6 relates to a specification in Table 3.  What is striking about the counterfactuals is that, with 
the exception of the border measure of proximity, the series are quite close together.   This 
implies that the heterogeneity in: (i) econometric technique, (ii) observation weights, and (iii) 
the geographic scope of the centroid-based treatment group across specifications does not 
amount to much when applied to the population of prices.  The fact that the border-based 
counterfactual lies below the rest indicates that the estimated overall influence of the UPPs is 
indeed sensitive to geographic scope when applied as broadly as in that specification.  In other 
words, lower average price effects in the border specification are more than fully offset by the 
larger base of neighborhoods that they are being applied to.  All in all, the range of 
counterfactuals implies that without the UPP program the cumulative growth rate of property 
prices in Rio would have been between 12 and 22 percent lower.  Taking an average across 
specifications, the UPPs accounted for 15 percent of the growth in prices since January 2008. 

The analogous results for the effect of the UPPs on crime rates, estimated with equation 

(3), are shown in Table 4.  As mentioned above, since the crime data are inclusive of all 
bairros and dates, neither the selection model nor weighted least squares specifications are 
employed.  This leaves us with three specifications of the scope of the treatment group for 
both robberies and homicides.  The overall effects imply that the UPPs had large negative 
effects on the levels of each crime, on the order of 10-25 percent for homicides and 10-20 
percent for robberies, with the bairro-based estimates at the larger end of the range and the 
border-based estimates at the smaller end.  The effect of the UPPs on crime is very 
heterogeneous across UPPs.  In some instances the effects are very strong, on the order of 
sixty or even seventy percent declines in the homicide rate.  In other instances the effect is not 
distinguishable from zero.  Perhaps due to the lumpiness of the crime data over time, as 
homicides and robberies in each bairro and month bounce around near the zero level, it is 
difficult to obtain precise estimates for each UPP.  At the very least, there are no statistically 
significant estimates of crime rates going up due to a UPP.   
                                                                                                                                                                                          
listings within bairro/rooms combinations in 2008.  Further, FIPEZAP reduces the amount of noise in the data by 
only including observations with greater than 5 listings and then taking the median value of observations over 
the past 3 months, steps which we do not take here.  (For more information on construction of the FIPEZAP 
index, see Notas Metodologicas in “Fundacao Instituto de Pesquisas Economicas” (2011)).  

 

20 

The economic and social significance of these estimates are illustrated by the 

counterfactual crime rate estimates in Figure 7.  Crime counterfactuals are computed similarly 
to the price counterfactuals above, except that they are aggregated across neighborhoods using 
2008 bairro population measures as weights.  Since the estimates of the UPP elasticity are 
negative, the actual series (denoted by the red solid line) lies below the counterfactual series; 
the difference indicates the effect of the policy on the city-wide crime rate.  The top panel 
shows that the UPPs were not the dominant factor in determining the rate of homicides at the 
city level, as the counterfactuals track the actual series quite closely.  That said, by the end of 
the sample the various counterfactual simulations unanimously show a contribution by the 
UPPs of 14 percent of the decline in homicides since their peak in May 2009.  This translates 
into about 1 homicide per 100,000 people annually, or roughly 60 people in the municipality 
of Rio in 2011.  By any measure, this is a substantial number lives that potentially owe to 
improved security.  Similar observations can be made about the robbery rate in the bottom 
panel of Figure 7, in which about 20 percent of the fall in robberies since mid-2009 was 
attributable to the UPPs. 

Finally, we can use the property price effects and crime effects estimated separately in 

equations (1) and (3) to compute the crime elasticity of house prices.  A simple way to do so 
is to compare the estimates of 

n,3  from each equation to see whether large crime effects 
corresponded to large house price effects for a given UPP.  Loosely speaking, this is a two-
stage instrumental variable regression where the first stage regresses crime on the UPP policy 
variables.  Figure 8 illustrates the homicide elasticity of property prices, where each dot 
matches the coefficients from (1) and (3) in Tables 3 and 4, respectively.  Due to the 
imprecision of the some of the homicide estimates, only the matches where both policy 
coefficients are statistically significant at the 5 percent level are shown.  There is a clear 
negative relationship between crime and property prices, with a ten percent decline in the 
homicide rate corresponding to a 1.8 percent increase in nearby house prices.

V.  Crime and house price inequality 

Having established an empirical relationship between crime and residential property 

prices, we now derive formal expressions for the changes in the distribution of house prices 
due to a discrete change in the crime rate.  We then evaluate the predictions of the model by 
constructing measures of inequality within- and across-bairros in the ZAP data. 

a)  A model of house price dispersion 

The only source of variation in the model is a change in the probability of a crime 

 in a given bairro  b  conditional on the absence or presence of a UPP

 .  Assuming some disutility from crime, this will have a positive 

effect on the flow of consumption services embodied in the property, and hence on the net 
present value of the future stream of those services.  The objective of this exercise is to show 
that the prices of properties with either low initial prices or those in neighborhoods with 
higher initial crime rates react more strongly to a given change in the crime rate, compressing 
the distribution of property prices. 

First, we assume that the consumption value of housing, denoted  U , for a specific

enters negatively into the expression for consumption services as the value of the public ‘bad’ 
due to crime.  In that summation, we also make an important assumption about the dynamics 
of consumption services due to the probability of a crime; the contribution of lagged values of 
crime to consumption services decays geometrically over time, which introduces some non-
linearity in the response of utility and, as we will show below, in the response of house prices

discounted by a factor , which for a constant crime rate is:

 Proposition 1: Conditional on

Proposition 1 is a close analogue to equation (1) in the empirical exercise above, which 

relates house prices to the installation of a UPP conditional on the average price level in each  
bairro and the average growth rate of prices for properties in the control group. 

Now let us consider a change in the value of  UPP   from zero to one.  We can rewrite 

equation (7) in terms of both

Notice that the first two terms in this expression represent the consumption services of a 
property where the entire history of crime in its neighborhood at the level  
combined third and fourth terms are a function of the relative weight given to more recent 
history at the lower crime rate and more distant history at the higher crime rate.  The size of 
the contribution of this combined term to total consumption services depends crucially on the 
size of the difference between the old and new crime rate; when there is no difference

This particular specification of housing consumption services is a departure from related 
literature, such as Besley and Mueller (2011) in which house prices are a linear function of 
contemporaneous amenity value and the crime rate, but its treatment of dynamics is quite 
similar in spirit.  In our model, we have a much simpler treatment of agents' expectations (i.e., 
agents assume a constant crime rate going forward) but the transmission of a one-time change 
in the crime rate into prices depends similarly on the history of crime.  Specifically, 
immediately after the change (
way up to  

 , but rather asymptotically approaches that level as the history of 

), the value of consumption services does not move all the

fades.  Thus, current and future consumption flows depend on both the level and duration of 
crime rates in the past. 

 Proposition 2: Conditional on a property's amenity value ( 

ibh ), progressively larger 

decreases in crime lead to smaller marginal improvements in housing consumption services.  
In other words, there are diminishing marginal returns to crime reduction.  This follows 

directly from the concavity of consumption services in the crime rate:

We can illustrate this second proposition graphically using equation (8).  Figure 9(a) 

illustrates the crime-related portion of consumption services (i.e., the combined second, third 
and fourth terms) for a hypothetical reduction in  r  from an initial level of  
 . It is 
clear from the concavity of the curves for any  n  that larger decreases in crime lead to smaller 
increases in housing consumption services.  Further, the degree of curvature in the 
consumption services schedule increases with  n , the number of periods ago that the UPP was 
installed. This is an intuitive result.  The longer ago the UPP was installed (i.e., for larger  n ) 
agents care less about incremental units of the decrease in crime.   

)0( 

r

Diminishing returns to crime reduction could play a key role in the changing distribution 

of property prices after the establishment of the UPPs.  For example, two properties with 
identical amenity values in bairros with different crime rates could potentially have very 
different responses to the installation of a UPP and a common decrease in crime.  The 
property in the bairro with a high crime rate will both have lower initial prices and a larger 

 

24 

change in its consumption services, which will have the effect of compressing the distribution 
of property prices across bairros.  In principle, this same effect would apply for two properties 
within the same bairro were they to face either different initial levels of crime or different 
changes in their crime rate.  However, in light of the fact that we only observe bairro-level 
data, we have assumed in equations (7) and (8) that the crime rate affects the values of all 
properties within a bairro uniformly.   

This assumption need not imply that the distribution of house prices within bairros is 

unaffected by a uniform reduction in crime.  As the next proposition shows, variation in the 
amenity value of properties within a bairro is sufficient to create concavity in house prices 
relative to the crime rate.  This is because when amenity values are higher, the percent change 
in crime-related consumption services after a decrease in crime is applied to a higher (time-
invariant) base, implying a lower percent change in the sum of the amenity value and crime-
related consumption services.   

Proposition 3: Conditional on the initial level and change in the crime rate (i.e.,  

  and  
ibh , will have a higher percent change in price.

the amenity value of a property goes up, the percentage change goes down at a decreasing 
rate.  The lowest quality properties, those with the lowest amenity value, therefore stand to 
gain the most from decreases in crime. 

 

b)  Empirical results 

Propositions 2 and 3 suggest that properties of lower value (whether due to high crime 
rates or low amenity values), will appreciate disproportionately following a decrease in the 
crime rate.  This would manifest itself both as a decrease in dispersion of property prices city-
wide as well as the dispersion of prices within-neighborhoods.  To evaluate this claim, we 
begin by computing a measure of house price inequality across all of the neighborhoods in 
Rio.  We choose a common measure of wealth dispersion, the Gini coefficient, computed 
using a formula similar to the one in Deaton (1997):

tX is the price ranking of each neighborhood 

relative to all others in that period.  Prices for a property with a certain number of rooms are 
aggregated using the total number of listings of that property type and neighborhood in 2008 
ibw2008 ).  Then, to aggregate across neighborhoods, prices are weighted by their 2008 
(denoted 

population (denoted 

bw2008 ).19 Higher values indicate greater inequality of prices across 

neighborhoods. 

                                                            
19 Since the panel of price observations is highly unbalanced (i.e., there are many neighborhoods that were not 
initially in the sample but entered over the course of the past three years) N includes only those that appeared in 
the ZAP data in January 2008.  It is important to have a balanced panel to control for the changing composition 

 

26 

Figure 10 illustrates the Gini coefficient for actual and counterfactual city-wide property 

prices.  The solid red line shows that dispersion has fallen by about two and a half points since 
the beginning of 2008, from 0.29 to 0.265.  To put these numbers into context, recall that the 
national measure of income inequality in Brazil fell from about 0.60 in 2001 to 0.53 in 2010.  
The level of income inequality is higher since we only observe listings for formal property 
markets; were we to observe the lower average real estate prices in the favelas our measure 
would likely be much more skewed.  Instead, one should focus on the magnitude of the 
change in inequality over time.  Over the course of the 2000’s, which was a very prosperous 
decade for Brazil in which millions of people where lifted out of poverty, the Gini coefficient 
fell by only 5 points. We therefore might expect that even small changes in the Gini 
coefficient for wealth are economically meaningful. 

In terms of the contribution of the UPPs to falling inequality, each counterfactual Gini 
coefficient in Figure 10 lies above the actual Gini by the end of the sample.  This indicates 
that the UPPs accounted for some portion of the decreasing inequality.  That said, there is a 
lot of heterogeneity across counterfactual specifications; this is a function of the number of 
neighborhoods that the estimates are applied to, with the bairro-based estimates having the 
smallest geographic scope and the border-based estimates the largest.  For the bairro-based 
estimates the contribution equals about one quarter of the decline in inequality since 2008 and 
for the centroid-based estimates, the contribution is about 45 percent.  In the most extreme 
case, applying the UPP price effects to all neighborhoods with a border within 2km of a UPP 
implies that counterfactual inequality would be back at its initial level by the end of the 
sample period, a 100 percent contribution by the UPPs.20 

Proposition 3, which predicts changes in within-bairro dispersion arising from 

heterogeneous amenity values, is not straightforward to measure with bairro-level house 
prices data.  However, using the standard deviation of prices for each observation provided by 

                                                                                                                                                                                          
of listings on ZAP over time; for instance, the systematic entry of low-priced neighborhoods into the ZAP 
listings could increase measured inequality even if the underlying level of inequality among incumbent 
neighborhoods had not changed. 
20 A decrease in the house price Gini coefficient of half a point to 2.5 points due to the UPPs seems to compare 
favorably with other policies aimed at reducing inequality.  For example, Soares et al. (2006) decompose the 
national income Gini coefficient into components owing to the well-regarded Bolsa Família program of 
conditional cash transfers.  They find that Bolsa Família was responsible for a reduction of .571 Gini points, or 
21% of the total fall in the national Gini coefficient from 1995 to 2004. 

 

27 

ZAP combined with the estimates of the price effects of the UPPs in Table 3, one can infer 
whether low-priced properties responded disproportionately to the UPPs.  Replicating our 
analysis of the price effects on UPP levels, we estimate the following difference in differences

where the only distinction between equations (10) and (1) is that the dependent variable is the 
log of the bairro-level standard deviation of property prices as opposed to the log of the 
n,3 means that the standard deviation of prices 
average price.  A negative estimate of 

declined due to the UPP at the same time as the average price increased (Table 3).  These two 
observations together necessarily imply that the lower-priced properties grew faster than the 
higher-priced properties in neighborhoods with a UPP nearby. 

Table 5 shows the estimates of 

n,3  in equation (10).  For several UPPs the bairro-level 
estimates do suggest that prices condensed after the UPP.  For instance, after the first UPP in 
Santa Marta the standard deviation of prices declined by 2-4 percent in Botafogo and Humaita 
while average prices increased by 10 percent in those neighborhoods.  Though the same can 
be said for about 5 other UPPs, several bairros experienced increases in price dispersion and 
the border- and centroid-based estimates are even less supportive of declining price 
dispersion.  The weighted least squares specification, along with the border and centroid 
specifications have positive average effects across UPPs.  

In sum, while city-wide price inequality appears to have declined due to the UPPs, the 
sign of the effect on within-bairro price dispersion is ambiguous across specifications. One 
likely difficulty with testing Proposition 3 is that the initial crime rates and changes in crime 
are unlikely to be uniform within a neighborhood, much less for different distances from a 
UPP.  It is also possible that amenity values are correlated with UPP distance within a 
neighborhood in a way that makes the effect of crime on dispersion difficult to identify.  Both 
of these measurement issues suggest that inequality could be better identified using more 
disaggregate data on individual listings, which is a worthwhile approach for future work on 
this subject.

VI.  Concluding remarks 

The basis of the UPP program is reestablishing the rule of law where order was dictated 

by groups engaged in criminal activity.  Destabilizing such groups by removing their physical 
domain over the favelas was meant to: (i) reduce criminality and violence; (ii) ease 
availability and access to public services, including health, education, sanitation; (iii) create a 
better environment for business and commerce (not limited to popular “social” tourism); and 
(iv) generally improve quality of life.  The UPP policy has been widely regarded as being a 
successful strategy to achieve these goals, and we have demonstrated that the associated 
positive externalities manifested themselves in property prices.  Between 2008 and mid-2011, 
we estimate that the UPPs accounted for about 15 percent of price growth in Rio’s formal 
property markets, an observation which we link to the contribution of the UPPs to falling 
crime rates. 

We then describe and document the relationship between crime and property price 

inequality. A key theoretical insight is that incorporating historical crime rates into a 
property’s valuation causes the rate of price adjustment following a decrease in crime to 
depend on the property’s initial value.  Thus price inequality can potentially decrease as low-
priced properties react more to crime reductions.  Indeed, the UPPs account for a non-trivial 
portion of the trend decline in inequality across neighborhoods in Rio.  The mean of our 
various empirical specifications suggests that almost half of the decline in price inequality 
over the sample period is attributable to the UPPs. 

These findings illustrate a potentially significant new dimension of policies aimed at 

reducing either crime or inequality.  Existing attempts to ameliorate economic disparities tend 
to focus on transfers of income and policies capable of reshaping the wealth distribution in 
any meaningful way are uncommon.  The UPPs in Rio demonstrate that crime reduction can 
play a role in reducing economic inequity, operating through the distribution of wealth.  In 
principle, this should be an important consideration for crime- and conflict-laden regions 
elsewhere.
