Assignment 1 (Color segmentation - 10p)
Use the image ’gummy bears.jpg’ for this task.
(a) (5p) Implement k-means clustering for color image segmentation on the RGB image (yourself,
no built-ins). The function should evaluate the result for diﬀerent values of k. Also, handle
empty clusters by re-initializing the corresponding center vector. Stop the calculation when
the center vectors do not change more than a predeﬁned threshold.

(b) (1,5p) Modify the previous implementation to perform k-means clustering on the HSV image

instead of on the RGB image.

(c) (3,5p) Think of a way to improve the color segmentation with k-means clustering on the
HSV image and implement it (e.g. using only individual color channels). You’re free to try
any ideas, but the result should show an improvement as to the previous task.
