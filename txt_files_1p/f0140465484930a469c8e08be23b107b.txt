I Abstract This study examined
the discriminant validity of the
German version of CBCL in two
large samples of referred and non-
referred children and adolescents
which were matched for age, sex
and socio-economic status. The
combined sample that was used for
statistical analysis consists of 2,058
referred and 2,058 non-referred
boys and girls between 4 and 18
years of age (mean age: referred
boys=10.9 years, non-referred
boys=10.9 years, referred
girls=11.3 years, non-referred
girls=11.1 years). Referral status

was used as validity criterion. Sta-
tistical procedures included Odds
Ratios, Total Predictive Values,
ROC analyses and discriminant
analyses. Results indicated that the
discriminant validity of the Ger-
man version of CBCL is compara-
ble to the original English version.
With the use of CBCL Total Prob-
lem Score as predictor (cut-off T≥
60) 83.8 % of children and adoles-
cents could correctly be classified
(sensitivity 83.6 %, specificity
83.9 %). Symptoms of the “Atten-
tion Problems Scale” show the
highest discriminative power to
distinguish between disturbed and
undisturbed children and adoles-
cents.

To  assess  child  psychiatric  disorders  two  major  ap-
proaches  are  used: on  the  one  hand, categorical  diag-
noses that describe psychopathological states as distinct
syndromes; on the other hand, dimensional approaches
that view psychopathology as a deviance from normal
with no clear threshold between subjects with or with-
out a disorder.

The  Child  Behaviour  Checklist  (CBCL)  was  devel-
oped by T. Achenbach (1, 2) for the use of dimensional
assessment  of childhood  competencies  and  psy-

chopathological problems. In the last two decades this
checklist  approach  has  had  significant  influence  in
many  countries. CBCL  has  been  translated  into  more
than 60 languages and has been used in numerous stud-
ies. The cross-cultural generalisability of CBCL was con-
firmed  in  studies  that  compared  samples  of several
countries with different cultural backgrounds (6, 7, 27).
In Germany CBCL was first used in epidemiological
studies  by  Poustka  and  Schmeck  (21, 22)  and  Rem-
schmidt and Walter (23). In 1993 a German consensus
version (3, 9) was published that has been widely used in
German-speaking countries since then. Reliability and
factorial validity of this German version has been suc-
