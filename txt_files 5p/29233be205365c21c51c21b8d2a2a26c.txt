Abstract. Soﬁ F, Valecchi D, Bacci D, Abbate R, Gensini
GF, Casini A, Macchi C (Centro S. Maria agli Ulivi, On-
lus IRCCS; Thrombosis Centre, University of Flor-
ence; Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi,
Florence, Italy). Physical activity and risk of cognitive
decline: a meta-analysis of prospective studies.
J Intern Med 2011; 269: 107–117.

Objective. The relationship between physical activity
and cognitive function is intriguing but controversial.
We performed a systematic meta-analysis of all the
available prospective studies that investigated the
association between physical activity and risk of cog-
nitive decline in nondemented subjects.

Methods. We conducted an electronic literature search
through MedLine, Embase, Google Scholar, Web of
Science, The Cochrane Library and bibliographies of
retrieved articles up to January 2010. Studies were
included if they analysed prospectively the associa-
tion between physical activity and cognitive decline in
nondemented subjects.

Results. After the review process, 15 prospective stud-
ies (12 cohorts) were included in the ﬁnal analysis.

These studies included 33 816 nondemented sub-
jects followed for 1–12 years. A total of 3210 patients
showed cognitive decline during the follow-up. The
cumulative analysis for all the studies under a ran-
dom-effects model showed that subjects who per-
formed a high level of physical activity were signiﬁ-
cantly protected ()38%) against cognitive decline
during the follow-up (hazard ratio (HR) 0.62, 95%
conﬁdence interval
(CI) 0.54–0.70; P < 0.00001).
Furthermore, even analysis of low-to-moderate level
exercise also showed a signiﬁcant protection ()35%)
against cognitive impairment (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.57–
0.75; P < 0.00001).

Conclusion. This is the ﬁrst meta-analysis to evaluate
the role of physical activity on cognitive decline
amongst nondemented subjects. The present results
suggest a signiﬁcant and consistent protection for all
levels of physical activity against the occurrence of
cognitive decline.

Keywords: cognitive decline, dementia, exercise, physi-
cal activity.

Introduction

It is unquestionable that physical activity has positive
effects on health; indeed, over the last few decades, a
large body of evidence has shown that physical activ-
ity helps to reduce the risk of cardiovascular and
cerebrovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity, hyper-
tension and some cancers [1]. Moreover, it has been
demonstrated that an active lifestyle impacts on all
causes of mortality. With ageing, some cognitive
functions such as attention, memory and concentra-
tion decline, becoming slower and inefﬁcient, as for
some physical functions such as walking and bal-
ance. These manifestations are the result of neural

cell loss in the frontal, parietal and temporal lobes [2]
and strongly depend on an ipofunction of the mono-
aminergic and cholinergic pathways [3]. Many of
these cognitive changes are evident and can cause
mild disability, even if a state of dementia is not
reached.

Cognitve decline is heterogeneous, depending on var-
ious factors. Many studies have shown an inverse
relation between physical activity and the risk of
developing cognitive decline [4, 5], but the cause of
the association has not been clearly established. Indi-
viduals who remain active throughout life, especially
during middle age, generally have better cognitive

performance during later life, so preserving their cog-
nitive functions for longer. Recent evidence suggests
that in addition to reducing vascular risk factors,
physical activity may increase directly the production
of neurotrophic factors in the brain [6].

The results of a recent meta-analysis showed that
physical exercise is able to reduce the incidence of
neurodegenerative diseases; in particular, dementia
and Alzheimer’s disease [7]. By contrast, few and con-
ﬂicting data are available on the possible protective
role of physical activity on the occurrence of cognitive
decline, independent of the onset of neurodegenera-
tive disease [8–18].

Therefore, the aim of this study was to conduct a
meta-analysis of all the available prospective cohort
studies that investigated the association between
physical activity and cognitive decline in nondement-
ed subjects.

Methods

Selection of studies

Studies that investigated the possible association be-
tween physical activity and cognitive decline in non-
demented adults were identiﬁed through a computer-
ized search of all electronic databases: MedLine
(source: PubMed, 1966 to January 2010), Embase
(1980 to January 2010), Web of Science, The Cochra-
ne Library (source: The Cochrane Central Register of
Controlled Trials, 2009, issue 1), Clinicaltrials.org
and Google Scholar. Relevant keywords relating to
physical activity as Medical Subject Heading terms
and text words (‘physical activity’ or ‘physical exer-
cise’ or ‘exercise’, or ‘ﬁtness’ or ‘training’) were used in
combination with words relating to cognitive impair-
ment (‘cognitive decline’ or ‘cognitive function’, or ‘cog-
nitive impairment’ or ‘cognitive loss’, or ‘dementia’, or
‘cognition’ or ‘memory’). We limited the search strat-
egy to prospective cohort epidemiological studies,
with no language restrictions, supplemented by man-
ually reviewing the reference list of all retrieved arti-
cles.

Two investigators (FS, DV) assessed all potentially
relevant articles for eligibility. The decision to in-
clude or exclude studies was hierarchical and made
on the basis of the following: (i) the study title; (ii) the
study abstract; and (iii) the complete study manu-
script. In the event of conﬂicting opinions between
investigators, disagreement was resolved through
discussion.

Eligible studies were included if they met all of the fol-
lowing criteria: (i) a prospective cohort design; (ii) the
association between physical activity and cognitive
function as the primary or secondary outcome; (iii)
nondemented subjects evaluated at baseline; (iv)
clear deﬁnitions of methods used to assess cognitive
performance and cognitive decline; (v) reported data
on physical activity levels in relation to cognitive func-
tion; and (vi) reported estimates of association be-
tween physical activity and cognitive decline. Accord-
ingly, studies were excluded if: (i) the design was
cross-sectional, case control or interventional; (ii)
outcomes other than those of interest for the meta-
analysis were considered; (iii) patients with dementia
or cognitive decline at baseline were included in the
study; (iv) the association between physical activity
and cognitive decline was not reported; or (v) esti-
mates of the association between physical activity
and the decline in cognitive function were not
presented (Data S1).

The outcome of interest for the current meta-analysis
was cognitive decline or cognitive impairment, de-
ﬁned as decline in cognitive functioning tests at fol-
low-up examination (see Table 1 for further informa-
tion about tests used to measure cognitive function).

Data extraction

All data were reviewed and separately extracted by
two independent investigators (FS and DV) using a
standardized form. The following patient characteris-
tics were recorded: data and study cohort, country of
the study cohort, baseline year, number of subjects
at baseline, gender of the cohort, years of follow-up,
age of the study cohort at baseline, deﬁnition of out-
come of interest, methods used to assess cognitive
function and physical activity, hazard ratio (HR) and
conﬁdence interval (CI) values for risk of cognitive de-
cline, and adjustment for confounding factors in mul-
tivariate models.

Statistical analysis

We used Review Manager (RevMan; version 5.0.23 for
Macintosh; Copenhagen, Denmark) to pool results
from the individual studies.

Pooled results are reported as HR and are presented
with 95% CI with two-sided P values using a random-
effects model
(DerSimonian and Laird method).
P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically signiﬁ-
cant. When available, we used the results of the origi-
nal studies from multivariate models with the most

Physical activity and risk of cognitive decline

complete adjustment for potential confounders; the
confounding variables included in this analysis are
shown in Table 1.

The primary aim of the present meta-analysis was to
evaluate whether high levels of physical activity were
associated with signiﬁcant protection against cogni-
tive decline at follow-up. Thus, for studies reporting
low levels of physical activity, instead of high, in rela-
tion to cognitive decline, we recalculated the HR using
conventional procedures. Statistical heterogeneity
was evaluated using the I2 statistic, which assesses
the appropriateness of pooling the individual study
results. The I2 value provides an estimate of the
amount of variance across studies because of the het-
erogeneity rather than chance. Where I2 was greater
than 50%, heterogeneity was considered to be high.
Moreover, to further investigate the heterogeneity
across studies, we performed sensitivity analyses by
dividing studies into groups according to their main
characteristics. Subgroup analyses were then per-
formed according to gender, mean sample size of the
study populations (less than ⁄ at least 3500), mean
duration of follow-up (less than ⁄ at least 5 years) and
method used to evaluate cognitive function (mini-
mental state examination (MMSE) ⁄ other). Publica-
tion bias was appraised by visual inspection of the

funnel plot of effect size against standard error and,
analytically, by the Egger’s test.

Results

Study identiﬁcation and selection

Our search strategy yielded 58 articles (Fig. 1). Of
these, we ﬁrst excluded 17 articles because they had
a cross-sectional, case–control or interventional de-
sign. The selected articles were then carefully re-
viewed, and a further 14 articles were excluded be-
cause the reported outcome was incidence of
dementia or Alzheimer’s disease, i.e. not the outcome
of interest. Subsequently, 12 papers were excluded
because they did not report estimates of the associa-
tion between physical activity and decline in cognitive
function. The reasons for exclusion in all cases are re-
ported as supplementary information.

Thus, 15 prospective studies [5, 8–18] were included
in the analysis. Of these, three conducted analyses
separately for men and women and so were entered
into the ﬁnal analysis each as a single paper. The
number of participants included in the studies varied
from 27 to 10 308, with a follow-up time ranging from
1 to 12 years. A total of 33 816 nondemented sub-

jects were included in the analysis. During the follow-
up period, 3210 incident cases of cognitive decline
were reported.

Characteristics of the studies included in the meta-
analysis are summarized in Table 1. The included
studies were conducted all over the world, including
China, Singapore, USA, Canada and Europe. All of
the studies included only elderly subjects (>65 years)
with the exception of the study by Singh-Manoux
et al., [14] that investigated younger subjects too.
With regard to the methods used to assess cognitive
functioning at baseline, most of the studies used the
MMSE. In addition, the deﬁnition of cognitive decline
at follow-up varied substantially in terms of points of
decline for cognitive tests used to measure cognitive
function.

Meta-analysis

Meta-analytic pooling under a random-effects model
showed that subjects who performed physical activity
at baseline had a signiﬁcantly reduced risk of cogni-
tive decline during follow-up. Indeed, by grouping
studies according to the different levels of physical
activity, subjects who reported performing a high le-
vel of activity had a 38% reduced risk of cognitive de-
cline with respect to those who reported being seden-
tary (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.54–0.70; P < 0.00001)
(Fig. 2). We found no signiﬁcant heterogeneity
amongst the studies (I2 = 17%; P = 0.26).

Similarly, when low-to-moderate levels of physical
activity were taken into consideration, the signiﬁcant
protection against cognitive decline during follow-up
was still observed (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.57–0.75;
P < 0.00001), and with no signiﬁcant heterogeneity
amongst the studies (I2 = 33%; P = 0.10) (Fig. 3).

Sensitivity analyses

To investigate the possible differences across studies,
we performed sensitivity analyses by grouping stud-
ies according to various characteristics such as gen-
der of the study population, study size (mean size of
the study sample was 3500), length of follow-up
(mean duration was 5 years) and method used to
determine cognitive function (MMSE ⁄ other). Smaller
studies, including only women, and with a shorter
duration of follow-up, showed a tendency towards a
higher estimate of association in terms of signiﬁcant
reduced risk of cognitive decline, compared with lar-
ger studies, in men, and with a longer follow-up peri-
od (Table 2).

Publication bias

Funnel plots of effect size versus standard error to
investigate possible publication bias were broadly
symmetrical, suggesting the absence of publication
bias for both high and moderate levels of physical
activity (P > 0.05 for both levels, Egger’s test) (Figs 4
and 5).

Discussion

This is the ﬁrst meta-analysis that aimed to investi-
gate the association between physical activity and
cognitive decline in nondemented subjects. The over-
all analysis of 15 cohort prospective studies investi-
gating 30 331 nondemented subjects followed for a
period of 1–12 years and 3003 incident cases of cog-
nitive decline showed that physically active individu-
als at baseline have a signiﬁcantly reduced risk of
developing cognitive decline during follow-up. In-
deed, the cumulative analysis demonstrated a 38%
reduced risk of cognitive decline in subjects with high

levels of physical exercise, compared to sedentary
subjects. Moreover, low-to-moderate levels of physi-
cal activity similarly resulted in a signiﬁcantly re-
duced risk of deterioration of cognitive performance
()35%).

To date, few studies have investigated the relation-
ship between an active lifestyle and cognitive perfor-
mance in mentally healthy subjects, and results have
been conﬂicting [8–18]. Recent data, including some
from longitudinal studies and randomized trials, re-
ported a signiﬁcant association between physical
activity during leisure time and a reduced risk of cog-
nitive impairment at follow-up [4, 9], whereas other
studies reported no signiﬁcant beneﬁt of physical
activity on the decline in cognitive function [10, 19].
Recently, Hamer & Chida [7] conducted a meta-anal-
ysis to investigate the role of physical activity on the

occurrence of neurodegenerative diseases in nonde-
mented subjects. In the overall analysis, they found
that physical activity is able to decrease the risk of
neurodegenerative diseases such as clinical demen-
tia and Alzheimer’s disease, but they did not take into
account cognitive decline as a clinical outcome. By
contrast, the present meta-analysis is the ﬁrst, to the
best of our knowledge, that included only cognitive
decline as the clinical outcome. The choice to study
healthy subjects in relation to the decline in cognitive
functions was based on the hypothesis that physical
activity may help cognitive performance during age-
ing, by preventing disability rather than a speciﬁc dis-
ease. Cognitive decline can, in fact, occur as a part of
the ageing processes of the brain, without leading to
dementia but resulting in a poorer quality of life.
Nonetheless, the diagnosis of dementia is based on a
number of parameters other than the worsening of

exercise. This may stimulate the release of neuro-
trophins, increasing synapses and dendritic recep-
tors, and promoting neuronal growth and survival
[22]. Finally, it has been reported that an active life-
style is able to prevent stress by reducing cortisol
levels, which can positively inﬂuence cognitive func-
tion [23].

There are a few limitations in this meta-analysis.
First, the methods used to investigate cognitive de-
cline and levels of physical activity varied substan-
tially across the included studies. The MMSE test
was the most frequently used tool for the diagnosis of
cognitive decline, but other tests were used in some
studies. This might have resulted in a nonhomoge-
nous deﬁnition of cognitive decline amongst the stud-
ies. Indeed, the MMSE test with the classical cut-off
(>3-point decline at follow-up or a score lower than 24
points) seems to be very suitable for the diagnosis of
cognitive decline but is affected by learning bias and
is therefore less accurate compared to other neuro-
psychological tests. By contrast, however, sensitivity
analysis showed no signiﬁcant difference for esti-
mates of association in relation to the different meth-
ods used to determine cognitive function. Moreover,
with regard to physical activity, data were obtained
from questionnaires; thus, bias could be introduced
by misinterpretation of the questions and the per-
sonal perception of fatigue. In addition, studies differ
in the methods used to classify the level of activity,
ranging from studies with a simple differentiation of
active ⁄ not active to others with three or four levels of
intensity. Nevertheless, heterogeneity results as well
as subgroup analyses did not show any signiﬁcant
differences in risk reduction amongst physically ac-
tive subjects in terms of the intensity of activity. In-
deed, in the overall results, we did not observe a dose–
response effect; instead, we found similar estimates
of association for both high and low-to-moderate
intensity of exercise.

In conclusion, these results highlight the important
role of physical activity in the protection of mental
functions even in subjects without neurodegenera-
tive disease. These considerations could be impor-
tant especially because the population is ageing and
a good cognitive function is fundamental for individ-
ual autonomy and quality of life, even in nondement-
ed subjects. The effect of physical activity does not ap-
pear to be dose dependent, but may be stronger in
women than in men. However, further studies are
needed to determine the optimal type, frequency and
intensity of exercise to preserve the integrity of cogni-
tive function.

cognitive performance, and patients referred to as
‘nondemented’ could show signs of slight cognitive
decline as early clinical manifestations of neurode-
generative disease.

Several explanations for the protective effect of
physical activity on cognitive functions have been
suggested. First, physical exercise helps to main-
tain cerebrovascular integrity, by sustaining blood
ﬂow and the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the
brain [20]. Furthermore, physical activity positively
inﬂuences cardiovascular risk factors, such as dia-
betes, hypertension, obesity and dyslipidaemia,
and reduces the incidence of cardiovascular and
cerebrovascular events, with global haemodynamic
beneﬁts [21]. Secondly, another possible protective
mechanism is the neurotrophic effect of physical
