Distribution of trials in the experiment: 

We had a doubt about how the conflict vs. the non conflict trials should be distributed. 
There were two options: 

1.  The proportion of conflict vs. non-conflict trials should be equal to the conditions 

table i.e. 5:10 which would make 200 conflict trials and 400 non-conflict trials. This 
was the distribution in the Achtziger et al article. 

2.  Since non-conflict trials weren’t exactly interesting to us we wanted a 50:50 

proportion so 300 conflict and 300 non-conflict trials. 

Dr. Martens suggested that reducing non-conflict trials should ideally not affect the 
behavioural data. So we decided to go with option 2! More Artefacts! 

Distribution of neutral/non-conflict trials 

We have in total 15 conditions: 5 conflict and 10 non-conflict. Since we want 50:50 
proportions of trials, for total of 600 trials, we have 60 trials for each conflict condition and 
30 trials for each non-conflict condition. We again have 2 options: 

1.  Test all 10 non-conflict conditions with 30 trials each. 
2.  Take 5 of non conflict conditions that are most interesting and test with 60 trials 

each.  

Again, Dr. Martens said we only need the non-conflict trials for making the task easier and 
that Achtziger didn’t really care much for these conditions during analysis, we can choose 
our conditions on our own. So again option 2! 

Colour of the sides 

There’s an issue with colour blindness.  Blue and green are not really Dr. Marten’s 
favourites. But we will stick to these colours. 

Randomizing coloured sides on the sample  

Achtziger showed the sample as the balls were drawn and not sorted based on colour. We 
will do the same. So, for m=1 condition, we should have all possible placements of the blue 
side in the sample.
