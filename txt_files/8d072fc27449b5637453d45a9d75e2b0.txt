Super-diversity and its implications

Steven Vertovec

Abstract

Diversity in Britain is not what it used to be. Some thirty years of
government policies, social service practices and public perceptions have
been framed by a particular understanding of immigration and multi-
cultural diversity. That is, Britain’s immigrant and ethnic minority
population has conventionally been characterized by large, well-organized
African-Caribbean and South Asian communities of citizens originally
from Commonwealth countries or formerly colonial territories. Policy
frameworks and public understanding  and, indeed, many areas of social
science  have not caught up with recently emergent demographic and
social patterns. Britain can now be characterized by ‘super-diversity,’ a
notion intended to underline a level and kind of complexity surpassing
anything the country has previously experienced. Such a condition is
distinguished by a dynamic interplay of variables among an increased
number of new, small and scattered, multiple-origin, transnationally
connected, socio-economically differentiated and legally stratified immi-
grants who have arrived over the last decade. Outlined here, new patterns of
super-diversity pose significant challenges for both policy and research.

Keywords: Diversity; multiculturalism; immigration; United Kingdom; London.

At a Trafalgar Square vigil for the victims of the 7 July 2005 terrorist
attacks  in which victims included migrants from more than twenty
countries and alleged perpetrators from a further six  Mayor Ken
Livingstone stated that in London ‘you see the world gathered in one
city, living in harmony, as an example to all’ (in Freedland 2005). The
‘world in one city’ idea was also the title of a special section in the
Guardian newspaper celebrating ‘the most cosmopolitan place on
earth’ where ‘Never have so many different kinds of people tried living
together in the same place before’ (Benedictus and Godwin 2005, p. 2).
The ‘world in one city’ was the title of the Greater London Authority’s
analysis of the 2001 Census (GLA 2005a), too, which examined the
presence of people from 179 nations within the capital. The successful

London bid to host the 2012 Olympics also used the ‘world in one city’
slogan, suggesting that ‘In 2012, our multicultural diversity will mean
every competing nation in the Games will find local supporters as
enthusiastic as back home’ (www.london2012.org/en/city/onecity).

To be sure, the ethnic and country of origin diversity of London is
remarkable. Such diversity is manifesting in other parts of the country as
well. However, observing ethnicity or country of origin (the two often,
and confusingly, being used interchangeably) provides a misleading,
one-dimensional appreciation of contemporary diversity. Over the past
ten years, the nature of immigration to Britain has brought with it a
transformative ‘diversification of diversity’ (cf. Hollinger 1995, Marti-
niello 2004) not just in terms of bringing more ethnicities and countries
of origin, but also with respect to a multiplication of significant variables
that affect where, how and with whom people live.

In the last decade the proliferation and mutually conditioning
effects of additional variables shows that it is not enough to see
diversity only in terms of ethnicity, as is regularly the case both in
social science and the wider public sphere. Such additional variables
immigration statuses and their concomitant
include differential
entitlements and restrictions of rights, divergent
labour market
experiences, discrete gender and age profiles, patterns of spatial
distribution, and mixed local area responses by service providers and
residents. Rarely are these factors described side by side. The interplay
of these factors is what is meant here, in summary fashion, by the
notion of ‘super-diversity’.

By invoking ‘super-diversity’ I wish, firstly, to underscore the fact
that in addition to more people now migrating from more places,
significant new conjunctions and interactions of variables have arisen
through patterns of immigration to the UK over the past decade; their
outcomes surpass the ways  in public discourse, policy debates and
academic literature  that we usually understand diversity in Britain.
Secondly, then, the article serves as a call, or at least reminder, to social
scientists and policy-makers to take more sufficient account of the
conjunction of ethnicity with a range of other variables when
considering the nature of various ‘communities’, their composition,
trajectories, interactions and public service needs.

Much of the material and data in this article are certainly not new or
unknown to specialists in the field; what is hopefully of value, however,
is its assemblage and juxtaposition by way of re-assessing how
diversity is conventionally conceived. My view draws upon several
previous approaches to diversity, particularly concerning: multi-ethnic
arenas of interaction (importantly Lamphere 1992 and Sanjek 1998),
hypersegregation or the simultaneous impact of numerous dimensions
of ethnic residential concentration (Massey and Denton 1989),
minorities’ ‘multilayered experience’ within unequal power structures
