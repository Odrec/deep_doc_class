The ranges of many species have expanded at high latitudes
and  elevations  but  contracted  at  their  warm  margins  in
response  to  recent  climate  change  (Walther 
.  2002;
Thomas, Franco & Hill 2006). Changes to the distribution of
‘habitable  climate  space’  may  lead  to  extinctions  if  future
ranges are too small or isolated from current ranges, and con-
sequently the impact of climate change on biodiversity is of
increasing  concern  (Thomas 
.  2004).  The  mechanisms

that  determine  geographical  range  margins  remain  poorly
understood, limiting our ability to predict future species
distributions and to model the effects of climate change on
biodiversity (Pearson & Dawson 2003; Ibáñez 

. 2006).

et al

Climate  can  limit  distributions  directly  by  inﬂuencing  sur-
vival and fecundity, or indirectly through its effects on inter-
acting species, including food sources, natural enemies and
competitors (Gaston 2003). The prevailing view that climate
limits  distributions  directly  at  cool,  upper  latitude  range
margins is supported by considerable empirical evidence
(see  references  in Gaston 2003). An increasing number of
examples  show  how  climate  warming  has  allowed  range
expansions at high latitudes by reducing mortality (Crozier
2004; Walther, Berger & Sykes 2005) or increasing fecundity
(Davies 
. 2006). In contrast, there is little evidence for
direct climate limitation at warm margins, where biotic inter-
actions are believed to be more important (MacArthur 1972;
Brown,  Stevens  &  Kaufman  1996;  Parmesan 
.  2005).
Considering that the ﬁrst symptoms of biodiversity loss are
expected at lower elevational and latitudinal boundaries,
empirical evidence for the mechanisms that limit species
distributions in these areas is of particular importance for
modelling future species ranges and for adapting biodiversity
conservation to climate change (Hampe & Petit 2005).

et al

Phytophagous  insects  and  their  host  plants  are  useful
model systems for testing the effects of climate and  biotic
interactions on species distributions (Hodkinson 1999; Bale
. 2002), and have provided some of the ﬁrst evidence for
et al
the  climatic  mechanisms  behind  population  extinctions  at
warm  range  margins  (Parmesan  1996,  2005;  McLaughlin
.  2002).  The  progressive  restriction  of  phytophagous
et al
insects to warmer microhabitats is a well-documented explana-
tion for the locations of cool range boundaries (Thomas 1993;
. 1999), but evidence for the reverse pattern at
Thomas 
warm margins is lacking. In this study we determine the
relative roles of climate and larval host plants in determining
distribution  and  abundance  for  an  oligophagous  butterﬂy
across a naturally occurring thermal gradient incorporat-
ing both warm (low elevation) and cool (upper elevation)
range  limits.  We  ﬁrst  determine  changes  to  the  elevational
range  of  the  black-veined  white 
  L.  after
30 years of climate warming, and test for differences between
the current range of the species and its larval host plants. We
then investigate how climatic effects on the phenology, habitat
associations and survival of 
 could cause its eleva-
tional range to be narrower than that of  its host plant. In
contrast to prevailing explanations for range margins, we
ﬁnd  stronger  evidence  for  direct  climate  limitation  at  the
warm margin of the species distribution and for host plant
limitation at the cool margin.

From  May  to  August,  butterflies  were  counted  on  standardized
500 m long 
 5 m wide transects (Pollard & Yates 1993). The overall

2240 m in 2006.

where only one individual was recorded were excluded from ana
lyses,  because  sampled  butterflies  might  be  vagrants,  rather  than
representatives of a local breeding population.

To test the relation between the elevational range of 

A. crataegi
and its larval host species, the abundance of host plants was esti-
mated at each of the 43 transect sites in 2006. The route of the 500 m
transect was followed in August–September 2006 (before leaf fall)
and the number of plants of 
 spp.
that  occurred  in  the  5 m  wide  butterfly  transect  was  recorded,  to
give a density of each species per 0·25 ha (500 
 5 m). If any of the
plant  species  was  not  present  in  the  5 m  wide  transect,  then  the
transect was repeated with increasing widths of 10 m, 20 m, and up
to  a  maximum  of  50 m  width  (i.e.  25 m  on  either  side  of  the
recorder): host plant density per 0·25 ha was then estimated based
on the increased transect width. Host plant species are considered
present at a site if they were found in transects of 
 50 m wide. When

average elevation of 100 m grid squares intercepted by the transect

dataloggers were located at transect sites in 2006, and the temperature

loggers were placed in semishaded locations 1·5 m above the ground,
corresponding  to  typical 
  egg-laying  sites  on  shrubs.
Daytime temperature for the entire flight period was calculated as

all 
 observations in 2006). Daytime temperature during the

Host plants were searched for eggs and larval webs at sites across and
beyond the elevational range of 
. Twenty-three sites rang-
ing in elevation from 580 m to 1780 m (14 of which corresponded to
butterfly transect locations) were visited between 23 June and 12 July
2006. Repeated searching at elevations above 1800 m revealed no 
C.
 spp. at any
monogyna
sites. At each location the first 25 
 plants
encountered were searched for 
 egg batches and larval webs.
Where  fewer  than  25  plants  were  encountered,  all  available  host
plants were searched. The larval web is almost always on the same or
an adjacent leaf to the oviposition site, and so is an acceptable measure
of egg-site location. The height above the ground (
) and side of the
host plant (
) were recorded for each egg batch or larval web. In the
field 
 was recorded as the cardinal and ordinal points (i.e. north,
north-east, east, etc.); data were converted to degrees from north for
subsequent analyses (so that north = 0, both north-east and north-
west = 45,  both  east  and  west = 90,  etc.).  The  side  of  the  leaf  on
which eggs were located (upperside or underside) was recorded for
egg batches.

We hypothesized that at higher elevations eggs would be laid in
warmer  microhabitats:  on  the  south  side  of  plants,  closer  to  the
ground,  and  on  the  upper  surface  of  leaves.  Because  egg  batches
from the same site are not statistically independent, summary values
for each site were used in analyses. Dependent variables were mean
values of

batches laid on the leaf upperside (L) was tested using analysis of
deviance, including both elevation and elevation2 to test for a possible
curvilinear effect of elevation. Because the data were over-dispersed,
the model for L was tested using quasi-binomial error structure and
F-tests (Crawley 2002). To test whether the inclusion of sites with
summary values based on few data had a large effect, analyses were
repeated  excluding  sites  where  fewer  than  five  egg  batches/larval
webs were recorded.

Trends in egg and young larval survivorship were investigated by
transplanting egg batches onto host plants at different elevations.
Ten  female  A.  crataegi  were  caught  at  1450 m  and  maintained  in
captivity outside at 1300 m elevation, where they were provided
with semishaded C. monogyna plants for egg-laying. The number of

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eggs in each batch was recorded. Within 3 days of being laid, egg
batches  were  transplanted  to  nine  sites  at  approximately  100 m
intervals  between  900 m  and  1700 m,  corresponding  to  the  eleva-
tional range  of  A.  crataegi,  and  to  a  further  location  at 580 m,
below  the  current  low  elevation  limit.  Leaf fragments  with  egg
batches were attached using a drop of UHU® solvent-based glue
to  the  upper  surface  of  C.  monogyna  leaves,  with  two  batches  in
shaded microhabitats and two in unshaded microhabitats on each
tree. This was repeated for two trees at each site (resulting in eight
experimental batches at each elevation) except at 580 m, where only
one tree (four egg batches) was used because of a shortage of egg
batches. In total, 76 experimental egg batches were established
between 22 and 28 June 2006. The location of each egg batch was
marked so that it could be relocated and identified.

The  experimental  sites  were  visited  on  17  or  18 July  to  record
mortality of eggs and young larvae. The criterion for egg batch
survival was that living larvae were present. Sites with unhatched
egg batches were revisited on 27 July in case larvae had not had time
to emerge by the earlier visit. Egg batches were excluded from sub-
sequent analyses if the leaf onto which they had been transplanted
could not be recovered.

Survivorship of egg batches in shaded and unshaded treatments
was compared using a paired t-test. Generalized linear models with
binomial error structure were then used to test the effects of elevation
on survivorship. The proportion of surviving batches at each experi-
mental site was the dependent variable, with elevation as the predictor.
The analysis was repeated excluding data for the 580 m site, which
is outside the current elevational range of A. crataegi.

To determine whether Rosa spp. were potential hosts for A. crataegi
in the region, 10 egg batches were collected from C. monogyna in the
field on 5 July 2006. Half of these were transplanted onto the leaves
of Rosa spp. and the remaining control batches onto C. monogyna.
These egg batches were all placed within 100 m of each other with
the same elevation (c. 1350 m) and aspect (south). Egg batches were
attached to leaves on the south side of trees at approximately 1 m
above ground and were revisited on 17 July.

In 1967–73, A. crataegi was present at 17 sample locations
(based on observations of two or more adults) and absent from
19 locations. The lowest elevation population was at 640 m
(with a maximum count of 37 in one visit), and the highest at
1800 m  (with  a  maximum  of  6).  In  2006,  A.  crataegi  was
observed at 26 of 43 transect sites; of these, four were excluded
from analysis because only one individual was recorded. Sites
with  two  or  more  adults  ranged  in  elevation  from  930  to
1765 m.  The  elevational  range  appeared  to  have  shifted
uphill from 1967–73 to 2006, with the loss of populations
below 900 m (Fig. 2a).

The three potential host plants (C. monogyna, P. spinosa
and Rosa spp.) were present, respectively, at 25, 17 and 38 of
the  transect  sites.  The  distributions  of  the  two  main  host
plants extended to lower elevations than that of A. crataegi but
were absent from high elevations: transects with C. monogyna
ranged from 550 to 1535 m, and of P. spinosa from 840 to 1525 m
(Fig. 2b). Additional ﬁeld searches encountered C. monogyna up
to elevations of 1792 m, and P. spinosa as low down as 580 m.

occurrence in 2004 and 2005 also showed signiﬁcant positive
effects of elevation and negative effects of elevation2 (results
not shown). HOF models showed unimodal relationships of
probability of occurrence with elevation for A. crataegi, P.
spinosa and Rosa spp., but the best model for C. monogyna
was a plateau with a probability of occurrence of > 75% up to
1600 m, which rapidly declined at higher elevations (see Sup-
plementary material, Table S1).

Despite the differences between the distributions of A. cra-
taegi and its host plants, the best-ﬁtting logistic regression
model for A. crataegi occurrence in 2006 included a positive
signiﬁcant  effect  of  host  plant  count  (C.  monogyna + P.
spinosa). The coefﬁcient for host plant count was not signiﬁ-
cant (P = 0·27) but the removal of  the term produced a sig-
niﬁcant change in log likelihood (P = 0·006) (overall model:
logit probability of occurrence = –33·02 (± SE 12·68) + 50·12
elevation (km) (± 18·75) – 17·88 elevation2 (± 6·65) + 0·08 host
plant density (± 0·07); –2 log likelihood = 19·94, R2 = 0·77,
χ2 = 33·49, P < 0·001).

The mean annual count of A. crataegi at occupied transects
ranged from 14·8 to 16·1 in 2004–06, with maxima per site
ranging from 38 in 2004 to 72 in 2006. Linear regressions for
A. crataegi counts at occupied sites showed signiﬁcant effects
of  elevation  (positive)  and  elevation2  (negative)  (Table 2a;
Fig. 3a). Counts of host plants (C. monogyna + P. spinosa) in
sites where they occurred had a marginally non-signiﬁcant uni-
modal relationship with elevation (Table 2a, Fig. 3b). Rosa spp.
abundance also increased from low to mid-elevations, before
decreasing at high elevations (see Supplementary material, Fig.
S1). The density of A. crataegi per host plant increased sig-
niﬁcantly with elevation in 2004 and 2006 (Fig. 3c), but the
relationship  was  marginally  non-signiﬁcant 
in  2005
(Table 2b).

Rosa spp. occurred at both higher and lower elevations than
A. crataegi (elevational range 590–2040 m; see Supplemen-
tary material, Fig. S1).

The probability of occurrence of A. crataegi was not sig-
niﬁcantly related to elevation in 1967–73. In 2006, probability
of occurrence of A. crataegi and of the three plant species
peaked at mid-elevations, with signiﬁcant positive effects of
elevation (km) and negative effects of elevation2 in logistic
regressions  (Table 1).  Logistic  regressions  for  A.  crataegi

In 2006, the ﬂight period of A. crataegi was later at higher
locations (Fig. 4), whether analysed using mean ﬂight or ﬁrst
appearance date. Data from the smaller sample of transects in
2004–05 conﬁrmed this elevational delay, although mean ﬂight
date  was  not  signiﬁcantly  related  to  elevation  in  2005
(Table 3).  Flight  was  approximately  30–40 days  later  per
1 km increase in elevation in 2006, whereas in 2004–05 the
delay was 10–30 days per 1 km.

transects  in  2006  is  plotted  against  elevation  (km)  (regression
equation shown in Table 3).

Using data from 17 temperature data-loggers at transect
sites  where  A.  crataegi  and  its  host  plants  were  recorded,
mean daytime temperature (from 07.00 to 18.00 GMT) over
the  2 months  of  the  entire  regional  ﬂight  period  in  2006
decreased  by  8·9 °C  per  1 km  increase  in  elevation  (mean
temperature = 33·1 °C (± SE 2·7)–8·9 × elevation (km) (± SE
2·1); R2 = 0·54; F1,15 = 17·4, P = 0·001). Mean daytime tem-
perature for the month of peak ﬂight at each site had a less
pronounced  decline  of  6·2 °C  per  1 km  increase  in  elevation
(mean = 28·8 °C  (± SE  2·4)–6·2 × elevation  (km)  (± SE  1·9);
R2 = 0·41; F1,15 = 10·3, P = 0·006), because of the phenolo-
gical  delay  with  increasing  elevation.  Data  from  a  smaller
number  of  dataloggers  in  2004–05  also  showed  steeper
declines  in  temperature  with  elevation  for  the  2 months
encompassing the entire ﬂight period than for the local month
of peak ﬂight (results not shown).

In total, 351 host plants were searched, and data were recorded
for 236 egg batches and 63 larval webs. Egg batches were not
located randomly among host plants: the distribution of egg
batches/larval webs among trees differed signiﬁcantly from
that expected under a Poisson distribution (χ2-test: obser-
vations grouped ≥ 4 egg batches/larval webs per host plant;
χ2 = 237·98, d.f. = 3, P < 0·0001), indicating a clumped dis-
tribution of egg batches on relatively few host plants. No egg
batches or larval webs were found below 900 m.

For sites with at least ﬁve egg batches, the side of the tree on
which eggs were laid (degrees difference from north) was pos-
itively related to elevation (S° = 104·9 (± SE 18·1) × elevation
(km) – 30·6 (± SE 23·9); R2 = 0·72, F1,13 = 33·66, P < 0·001),
indicating that eggs were located on the north side of plants
at lower elevations, and on the south side of plants at higher
elevations (Fig. 5a). Height above ground of egg-sites was not
related to elevation. The proportion of eggs laid on the upper
surface of leaves (L) showed evidence of a curvilinear relation-
ship with elevation, peaking at middle elevations (Fig. 5b).
However, the relationship was not signiﬁcant in the analysis
of sites with ﬁve egg batches or more, where only one site
below 1100 m was included (because most eggs had already
hatched into larvae by the time of egg searches at low elevations).

E G G  A N D  L A R V A L  S U R V I V O R S H I P

There was no signiﬁcant difference in the proportion of egg
batches surviving to form larval webs in shaded and unshaded
environments  (paired  t-test,  t = 0·20,  d.f. = 8,  P = 0·847).
Data  for  shaded  and  unshaded  locations  were  therefore
pooled for subsequent analyses. Elevation was a highly sig-
niﬁcant predictor of the proportion of egg batches surviving
to form larval webs at experimental sites (generalized linear
model with  quasi-binomial  error  structure  to  correct  for
overdispersion: F1,8 = 11·61, P = 0·009; Fig. 6), and also after
excluding data from the 580 m site (F1,7 = 8·91, P = 0·020).
The parameter estimates for elevation were positive, showing
that mortality decreases with elevation.

Discussion

We present evidence for a shift in the elevational range of
the butterﬂy A. crataegi in central Spain between 1967–73
and 2006. The butterﬂy has apparently disappeared from
low elevations where its larval host plants remain, while its
ability to expand its distribution above its upper elevation
limit has been constrained by the absence of host plants at
higher elevations. We propose increasing temperatures as
a causal factor for the retraction of  A. crataegi from low
elevations,  based  on  evidence  that  larval  survivorship
increases with elevation. Information on population den-
sity, phenology and habitat use support the importance of
temperature in inﬂuencing the population dynamics and
elevational range of A. crataegi.

E L E V A T I O N A L  R A N G E  O F  A.  C R A T A E G I

The elevational range of A. crataegi retracted uphill between
1967–73 and 2006, with the species disappearing from ele-
vations below 900 m. In 1967–73 the butterﬂy’s range coin-
cided closely with that of its host plants (assuming that host
plant distribution did not change markedly between 1967–73
and 2006), with large populations recorded as low down as
640 m and up to 1800 m. By 2006, A. crataegi was absent from
sites below 900 m, in spite of the presence of host plants.
The loss of A. crataegi from 600 to 900 m elevations almost
certainly results from local population extinctions rather than
adult dispersal, as the nearest known extant populations of
the  species  are  25 km  or  further  from  the  lowest  elevation
locations where it was recorded in 1967–73. In contrast, the

upper elevation limit has not increased, and seems to be deter-
mined by the distribution of C. monogyna and P. spinosa. The
main host plants are rare above 1500 m and were not found
above 1792 m despite extensive searching. The few transect
locations without host plants where A. crataegi was observed
(all of them at 1400 m elevation or above) were within 2·5 km
of  the  nearest  known  C.  monogyna  plant,  and  had  annual
counts of four or fewer A. crataegi.

At occupied sites, the population density of  A. crataegi
increased from low to mid-elevations before declining above
1500 m (Fig. 3). The decline in population density at high
elevations appears to be related to a concurrent decline in
host plant density. There was an indication that the density
of A. crataegi relative to that of its host plants increased lin-
early with elevation (Fig. 3c). One possible explanation for
such a pattern is that the proportion of host plants that was
suitable (e.g. for egg-laying or larval survival) increased with
elevation.

E G G  A N D  L A R V A L  S U R V I V O R S H I P

Field transplant experiments across and below A. crataegi’s
current range revealed a signiﬁcant effect of elevation on the
survivorship of egg batches and young larvae. Direct temper-
ature effects seem to be the most likely explanation for the
trends in A. crataegi survival (for effects of high temperatures
on egg and larval survival in other Lepidoptera see Bryant,
Thomas & Bale 1997; Alonso 1999). Differences in rates of
leaf maturation or senescence at different elevations (e.g. Weiss
et al. 1988; Bale et al. 2002) are unlikely to explain differences
in mortality of young A. crataegi larvae, as leaves are fully mature
at all elevations at dates of egg hatch (June–July). In addition,
mortality often occurred before the emergence of larvae, with
no evidence of larval webs for nine of the 14 experimental egg
batches that did not survive at sites below 1200 m.

Insects may escape their natural enemies at higher elevations
or latitudes by entering predator-free space (Randall 1982;
Hodkinson 1999), representing another possible explanation
for elevational trends in A. crataegi survivorship. We observed
no evidence that parasitoids or predators were responsible for
the pattern observed, and in most cases the unhatched eggs
remained intact on the leaves. Nevertheless, it would be nec-
essary to extend the experimental manipulation (e.g. Crozier
2004; Hill & Hodkinson 1995) to determine the contribu-
tions to A. crataegi mortality of direct climatic effects, and of
effects  mediated  by  other  trophic  levels,  that  potentially
reﬂect the indirect effects of climate. Whichever mechanism
is responsible, the effects of the elevational gradient on egg
batch and young larval survivorship will have a negative effect
on the viability of A. crataegi populations at low elevations,
with the potential to limit the distribution of this species.

Elevation was a signiﬁcant predictor of both mean and ﬁrst

emergence  dates  for  insects  at  higher  elevations  (Fielding
et al. 1999; Crozier 2004; Hodkinson 2005). Elevation affects
mean  temperature,  potentially  inﬂuencing  the  date  of  dia-
pause cessation and rates of larval and pupal development
after hibernation. The differences in phenology in 2006 were
pronounced, with butterﬂies ﬂying 30–40 days later per 1 km
increase in elevation (Fig. 4).

Climate-driven changes to species phenology could affect
survival or fecundity, by shifting key stages of life cycles to
cooler or warmer times of the year (Wilson, Davies & Thomas
2007)  or  by  disrupting  biotic  interactions  (Ibáñez  et al.
2006). Because A. crataegi butterﬂies ﬂy later at higher ele-
vations,  the  temperatures  experienced  by  adults  do  not
decrease with altitude as sharply as might be predicted, all
else being equal. However, results from temperature data-
loggers at transect sites show that mean daytime tempera-
ture during the local peak month of A. crataegi ﬂight (i.e. the
temperatures experienced by egg-laying females, eggs and
young larvae) still decreased by 6·2 °C per 1 km increase in
elevation.

E G G- S I T E  L O C A T I O N

At high elevations eggs were laid on the south side of host
plants, corresponding to hotter microclimates, whereas at
low  elevations  they  were  found  on  the  north  side  of  plants
(Fig. 5a),  suggesting  that  egg-laying  site  may  depend  on
ambient  temperature  (Davies  et al.  2006).  Based  on  our
results  for  survivorship,  the  pattern  could  result  from
selection  on  female  oviposition  behaviour  for  sites  whose
microclimate  favours  the  development  and  survival  of
larvae  (Gilbert  &  Singer  1977).  Further  experiments  are
needed to conﬁrm whether egg-site location in A. crataegi is
directly  related  to  temperature  during  oviposition,  or
whether  egg-site  choice  and  larval  survival  differ  among
populations from different elevations, representing possible
local adaptation.

Further work is also required to determine whether additional
climatic variables inﬂuence egg-site selection. For example,
exposure to ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B) can increase by
c. 20% per 1 km elevation (Blumthaler, Ambach & Ellinger
1997).  UV-B  can  cause  tissue  damage  in  insect  larvae
(Caldwell et al. 1998), and high levels of UV-B are avoided by
some insects (Mazza et al. 2002). In A. crataegi, there was an
indication that the proportion of egg batches laid on the
leaf  upperside peaked at middle elevations (Fig. 5b), a pat-
tern that could result if  host plant leaves protect eggs from
UV-B. At low elevations, exposure both to UV-B and high
ambient temperatures might be reduced for eggs on the leaf
underside.  Reduced  ambient  temperatures  at  increasing
elevations  could  then  favour  the  upperside,  but  at  the
highest elevations UV-B exposure may be so high that the
leaf  underside  is  again  favoured.  Research  is  needed  to
determine whether the effects of UV-B radiation on insect
development  and  survival  could  limit  species’  ability  to
track  climate  change,  by  preventing  range  shifts  towards
higher elevations.

Increasing temperatures are likely to drive the warm range
margin of A. crataegi away from low elevations, and the future
distribution of the species in the region will depend on its
ability to colonize high elevation sites. However, suitable host
plants might be unlikely to shift their distributions as quickly
in response to climate change. Recent research shows that a
broadening of host plant use by butterﬂies can increase rates
of range expansion at a landscape scale (Thomas et al. 2001).
The  ability  to  exploit  alternative  host  plants  such  as  Rosa
spp., which have a much wider elevational range (see Supple-
mentary material, Fig. S1), could greatly increase A. crataegi’s
ability  to  colonize  high  elevations. However, A. crataegi has
rarely been observed laying eggs on Rosa spp. in the region,
and our experimental transplants showed no evidence that
larvae are able to develop on these plants. Unless A. crataegi
can broaden its host plant use at higher elevations, it seems
inevitable  that  the  species  will  experience  an  increasingly
restricted elevational range as the climate warms.

Bioclimate  envelope  models  have  been  used  to  predict
future species distributions, based either on the geographical
range of suitable climate space or its overlap with currently
suitable conditions (e.g. Pearson & Dawson 2003; Thomas
et al. 2004). Our research emphasizes how, for specialist spe-
cies such as many phytophagous insects, observed retractions
in  potential  or  realized  distributions  are  likely  to  be  much
greater than previously estimated, because of reduced overlap
between  host  species  and  suitable  climate  (see  Andrew  &
Hughes  2004,  2005).  Realistic  models  of  future  species
ranges should include the effects both of species’ physiol-
ogical requirements and climatic associations, as well as those
of their key interacting species (Hodkinson 1999; Araújo &
Guisan 2006) or habitats (Franco et al. 2006).

Our work suggests that temperature is the most likely factor
determining the low elevation limit to A. crataegi’s distribu-
tion, whereas interacting species are responsible for its upper
elevation margin. This result contrasts with the prevailing
theory  that  species  interactions  determine  warm  limits  to
species distributions, while direct climatic limitation imposes
the cool boundaries to species ranges (MacArthur 1972; Brown
et al. 1996; Parmesan et al. 2005). The clearest change to the
distribution of A. crataegi was the loss of populations from
elevations of 600–900 m, despite the continuing presence of
larval  host  plants.  This  distribution  change  is  unlikely  to
reﬂect the effects of adult resources, since during A. crataegi’s
June ﬂight period the density of ﬂowers does not increase with
elevation, and many nectar sources are available in the habi-
tats  sampled  below  900 m  (S.  B.  Díez,  unpublished  data).
Instead, we show that egg and young larval survival increases
with elevation, with > 75% estimated mortality below the current
lower elevation margin. Increased mortality at low elevations
because of  increased temperatures in the region since 1967–
73 could represent a mechanism behind the range contraction
of A. crataegi, but further experimental work is needed to rule out
other competing explanations. For example, egg transplant

experiments that exclude predators or parasitoids could be
particularly informative (e.g. Crozier 2004), as well as trans-
location  experiments  using  the  progeny  of  females  from
lower  elevation populations, to test for a potential role of
adaptation across the elevational range.

Predictions indicate further warming of up to 4 °C by
2100 (IPCC 2007), corresponding to a c. 650 m shift in the
elevational distribution of isotherms. Considering that A.
crataegi is currently restricted to a 900 m band in the Sierra de
Guadarrama and may have little capacity to move to higher
elevations,  a  considerable  contraction  of  its  current  range
seems inevitable. If the distribution patterns revealed by this
study also apply to other areas in southern Europe and North
Africa where the species is restricted to mountains (García
Barros et al. 2004; J. Tennent, personal communication), then
the future of A. crataegi, and indeed other plant and animal
species  with  ranges  limited  in  similar  ways,  may  not  be  as
secure as its current widespread status implies.
