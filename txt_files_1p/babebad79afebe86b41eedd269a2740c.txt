expenditure in the enlarged Europe

Summary  This article demonstrates the potential of the disaggregated expenditure approach in com-
parative welfare state analysis by applying it for comparing patterns of welfare spending across 28 
European countries. An initial factor analysis shows that welfare states differ primarily along their 
emphasis  either  on  cash  transfers  for  the  elderly  or  on  social  services  and  cash  transfers  for  the 
working-age population. European welfare states cluster along these two spending dimensions in a 
way that to a great extent coincides with the well-known delineation of welfare regimes based on 
institutional characteristics. Furthermore, the results attest to the emergence of a variety of welfare 
arrangements in the post-communist region, yet with a general orientation toward a Bismarckian or 
conservative model. The results of this analysis demonstrate that disaggregated welfare expenditure 
measures retain considerable importance in elucidating the realities of contemporary welfare policy.

Comparing national patterns of welfare policies and 
classifying divergent types of welfare states consti-
tutes  an  important  field  of  comparative  welfare 
state  research  (for  an  overview,  see,  for  example, 
Abrahamson,  2000;  Arts  and  Gelissen,  2002; 
Bambra, 2007; for the genesis of the regime analy-
sis,  see  Castles  and  Obinger,  2008).  Typology-
building is thereby not just an intellectual endeavour 
or  an  end  in  itself,  but  an  important  analytical 
means to an end. Typologies serve as a tool for cog-
nitive  simplification.  In  Richard  Titmuss’  words: 
‘The purpose of model-building is not to admire the 
architecture of the building, but to help us see some 
order  in  all  the  disorder  and  confusion  of  facts, 
systems and choices’ (Titmuss, 1974: 30). Welfare 
state classifications and typologies offer a meaningful 
point of origin for theory-building and causal analysis, 
when  not  only  single  programmes  or  institutions, 

but also the entirety of welfare state arrangements is 
the focus of the research interest. This is often the 
case in macro-quantitative comparisons. 

Classification systems have long been dominated 
by  indicators  of  welfare  institutions  and  social 
rights.  In  contrast  to  simple  measures  of  social 
expenditure,  the  superiority  of  institution  and 
rights-based typologies has been repeatedly stressed 
in the past. Yet the lack of comparable and concep-
tually substantiated time series data on welfare pol-
icies  and  institutions  is  still  an  Achilles’  heel  in 
comparative analysis (Clasen and Siegel, 2007).1 As 
a consequence, cross-country comparisons of welfare 
policy  patterns  and  their  causes  and  effects  have 
either  been  limited  to  countries  for  which  more 
sophisticated  data  like  welfare  state  generosity  is 
available,  (that  is,  the  Organisation  of  Economic 
Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries)
