Is our culture left biased?

Much of our culture is dominated by properties ascribed to the left hemisphere. 
When we check the list of properties are those on the left considered positive, 
those on the right are looked down upon. Is this the “right” thing to do?

„Here are some language learning 
tips for left-brain learners: Take 
advantage of a formal language 
school program if possible. Your 
left-brain skills will help you do well 
and enjoy it ... „

... tips for right-brain learners: Take advantage of study 
programs organized around communicative techniques. 
You may be frustrated by traditional language programs ... 
Look for help if you have to design and manage a 
personal language learning program because many of the 
skills required are left-brain.

What it comes down to is that modern society  
discriminates against the right hemisphere. Roger Sperry, 1973

Switching

„Most  activities  require  both  modes, 
each contributing its special functions, 
but a few activities require mainly one 
mode, without interference from the 
other.  Drawing  is  one  of  these 
activities.	

!
Learning to draw, then, turns out not 
to be "learning to draw." Paradoxically, 
"learning  to  draw"  means  learning  to 
make a mental shift from L-mode to 
R-mode.  That  is  what  a  person 
trained  in  drawing  does,  and  that  is 
what you can learn.“

This is also characteristic of autism.

Understanding others: 
  

Hypothesis & concepts & promises

• Visual hypothesis / Theory theory - Action understanding is based 

on visual analysis of the different elements that form the action.	


• Direct matching hypothesis / simulation theory (“mirror system“) 
- While understanding an action the visual input is directly mapped 
on the motor system that would be responsible to do the task by 
oneself.	


• Here comes some evidence to the “direct matching hypothesis“.	

• “Starting from a neurobiological standpoint, I will propose that our 
capacity to understand others as intentional agents, far from being 
exclusively dependent upon mentalistic/linguistic abilities, be deeply 
grounded in the relational nature of our interactions with the 
world.”

Area F5

• Area F5 occupies the most rostral part of inferior area 6, extending 
rostrally within the posterior bank of the inferior limb of the arcuate 
sulcus. 	


• Area F5 is reciprocally connected with the hand ﬁeld of the primary 

motor cortex and has direct, although limited, projections to the upper 
cervical segments of the spinal cord. 	


• Microstimulation in F5 evokes hand and mouth movements at 

thresholds generally higher than in the primary motor cortex.	


• The activity of F5 neurons is correlated with speciﬁc hand and mouth 

motor acts and not with the execution of individual movements like 
contractions of individual muscle groups.   	


• What makes a movement into a motor act is the presence of a goal ...

Mirror neurons in monkeys:  
 

Mirroring communication

• Many (1/3) mouth motor neurons also discharge when the monkey 
observes another individual performing mouth actions. Most of these 
‘mouth mirror neurons’ become active during the execution and 
observation of mouth actions related to ingestive functions. 	


• Another population of mouth mirror neurons is most effectively 
activated by communicative mouth gestures (e.g. lip smacking). 	


• Some also ﬁre when the monkey makes communicative gestures. These 
ﬁndings extend the notion of mirror system from hand to mouth action. 
Of course this triggers wild speculations on the relation of F5 and broca’s area  
and the role of mirror neurons in the origin of language.

These results suggest

other individuals may

different mechanisms. 
Actions belonging to 
the motor repertoire 
of the observer (e.g., 
biting and speech 
reading) are mapped 
on the observer’s

that do not belong to 
this repertoire (e.g., 
barking) are essentially 
recognized based on 
their visual properties.  

These results are compatible with the direct matching hypothesis.

Somatotopic Representation of Action Words

Hauk et al. (2004)	

Neuron

Event-related fMRI is used 
to show that action words 
referring to face, arm, or leg 
actions (e.g., to lick, pick, or 
kick), when presented in a 
passive reading task, 
differentially activated areas 
along the motor strip that 
either were directly 
adjacent to or overlapped 
with areas activated by 
actual movement of the 
tongue, ﬁngers, or feet.

These results demonstrate that the referential meaning of action words has a correlate in 
the somatotopic activation of motor and premotor cortex.

In another voxel (right) neurons unselective with

Summary

– Mirror neurons are a particular class of visuomotor neurons.	

– They were recently discovered in F5. This is ventral premotor cortex or PMv	

– They can be speciﬁc to certain actions. 	

– They don‘t respond to fake actions or actions using tools.	

– There is evidence for the role of the “mirror system“ in action understanding and action 

imitation.	


– The might form a basis for the acquisition of language.	

!
The “visual hypothesis“:	


• Pro	


– The visual properties of some STS neurons	


• Contra	


– Not clear how validation of the meaning of the observed object is achieved	

– Not obvious how the complex properties could emerge	


The “direct matching hypothesis“	


• Pro	


– Existence of mirror neurons	

– Emerge of cells with complex properties with motor system as teacher	

– Not just visual stimuli are involved for action understanding 	


• Contra	


– Activation in motor areas might be due to motor preparation for imitation.	

– No explanation or demonstration that a certain type of representation is used 

in speciﬁc attributions.

A word of caution

Saxe (2009) Philos Studs

Simulation theory accounts of mind-reading propose that the observer 
generates a mental state that matches the state of the target and then 
uses this state as the basis for an attribution of a similar state to the 
target. The key proposal is thus that mechanisms that are primarily used 
online, when a person experiences a kind of mental state, are then co-
opted to run simulations of similar states in another person. 	

Here I consider the neuroscientiﬁc evidence for this view. I argue that 
there is substantial evidence for co-opted mechanisms, leading from one 
individual’s mental state to a matching state in an observer, but there is 
no evidence that the output of these co-opted mechanisms serve as the 
basis for mental state attributions. There is also substantial evidence for 
attribution mechanisms that serve as the basis for mental state 
attributions, but there is no evidence that these mechanisms receive 
their input from co-opted mechanisms.
