PHRASING A THESIS

• The thesis must be properly worded; it should be both interesting and 

contestable.

• Neither a vague and confusing, nor an obvious and boring thesis will yield an 

interesting argument.

• Similarly, neither an overly generalized nor a minutely speciﬁc thesis will result 

in a productive discussion.

• Properly worded, the thesis should…
be clear, comprehensible, and direct
be able to indicate the major parts of the paper
commit the author to an unmistakable point of view and/or course of 
argument

• It is often useful to use words emphasizing a certain development, viz. conﬂict/

contrast, representation/depiction, development, negotiation.
