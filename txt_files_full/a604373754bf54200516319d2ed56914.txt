(A) make and keep books, records, and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly 
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the issuer; and 

(B) devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable 
assurances that-- 

(i) transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or specific authorization; 

(ii) transactions are recorded as necessary (I) to permit preparation of financial statements in 
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles or any other criteria applicable to such

liability under paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be imposed upon any person acting in 
cooperation with the head of any Federal department or agency responsible for such 
matters if such act in cooperation with such head of a department or agency was done upon 
the specific, written directive of the head of such department or agency pursuant to 
Presidential authority to issue such directives. Each directive issued under this paragraph 
shall set forth the specific facts and circumstances with respect to which the provisions of 
this paragraph are to be invoked. Each such directive shall, unless renewed in writing, 
expire one year after the date of issuance. 
(B) Each head of a Federal department or agency of the United States who issues such a

require only that the issuer proceed in good faith to use its influence, to the extent reasonable under 
the issuer's circumstances, to cause such domestic or foreign firm to devise and maintain a system of 
internal accounting controls consistent with paragraph (2). Such circumstances include the relative 
degree of the issuer's ownership of the domestic or foreign firm and the laws and practices governing 
the business operations of the country in which such firm is located. An issuer which demonstrates 
good faith efforts to use such influence shall be conclusively presumed to have complied with the 
requirements of paragraph (2). 

(7) For the purpose of paragraph (2) of this subsection, the terms "reasonable assurances" and 
"reasonable detail" mean such level of detail and degree of assurance as would satisfy prudent officials 
in the conduct of their own affairs.

through public notice and comment procedures, shall determine to what extent compliance with this

the preceding provisions of this section and may, based on such determination and to the extent 
necessary and appropriate, issue-- 

(1) guidelines describing specific types of conduct, associated with common types of export sales 
arrangements and business contracts, which for purposes of the Department of Justice’s present 
enforcement policy, the Attorney General determines would be in conformance with the preceding 
provisions of this section; and 

(2) general precautionary procedures which issuers may use on a voluntary basis to conform their

request before receiving a response. 

(3) Any issuer who has made a request to the Attorney General under paragraph (1) may withdraw 
such request prior to the time the Attorney General issues an opinion in response to such request. Any 
request so withdrawn shall have no force or effect.

concerning the Department of Justice’s present enforcement policy with respect to the preceding 
provisions of this section to potential exporters and small businesses that are unable to obtain 
specialized counsel on issues pertaining to such provisions. Such guidance shall be limited to 
responses to requests under paragraph (1) concerning conformity of specified prospective conduct 
with the Department of Justice’s present enforcement policy regarding the preceding provisions of this
