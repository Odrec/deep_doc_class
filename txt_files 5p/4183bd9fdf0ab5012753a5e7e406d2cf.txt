Abstract

This paper describes key urban development strategies pursued during the last seven years by the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro,
the second largest city in Brazil. It discloses internal processes, organisational restructuring of the municipality and institutional
changes geared to increase eective urban management and resource mobilisation required to implement multiple sector pro-
grammes and key projects in several locations in the city like Favela Bairro and Rio Cidade Programmes, The Rio Strategic Plan,
etc. It is argued that the formation of interdepartmental working groups for better horizontal articulation of policy making and
implementation, the creation of the ®nancial and accounting unit, the decentralisation of authority towards sub-municipality levels,
and capacity strengthening of its personnel ± among other things ± have made a positive impact on the performance of local
government. The paper further highlights a signi®cant change towards policies of urban consolidation and revitalisation of declined
areas of the city supported by heavy public investments and the eort towards broader civil society involvement in municipal
projects. Municipal autonomy, problem-solving and result-oriented type of planning and management and organisational change
are some of the lessons pinpointed by the paper for a city of that size and complexity. Ó 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

1. Introduction

This paper describes key urban development strate-
gies pursued by the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro over
the last seven years during which the local government
undertook innovative actions that resulted in noticeable
improvements in urban management. One of the ob-
jectives is to disclose some of the internal processes and
measures taken by the local government in order to
generate resources and forge eective management
needed to put into motion multiple sector programmes
and projects in several locations in the city. The indirect
involvement of the author with the Rio Cidade and
Favela Bairro programmes via a long-term capacity
building programme allowed for participant observation
and on-the-job assessment with those municipal sta
who are in charge of dierent projects. Without any
ambition to formulate a theory on urban management
the author explicitly intends to present to a wider au-
dience the peculiarities and speci®c characteristics of the

programmes and to show how some of them were
managed and the results accomplished. It is an intention
to recover lessons learned and an institutional memory
that otherwise would be circumscribed to the munici-
pality and to those directly involved in the programme.
The paper suggests that there have been fundamental
changes in policies towards the city. It argues that these
changes could not be brought about without supportive
measures, capacity building and organisational restruc-
turing and institutional changes needed to support new
approaches to urban problems. It is argued that or-
ganisational restructuring, the formation of interde-
partmental working groups for better articulation of
policy making and implementation, the decentralisation
of authority towards
sub-municipality levels, and
capacity building of its personnel ± among other things ±
have resulted in noticeable improvements in local gov-
ernment performance. The analysis of this experience is
particularly important given the fact that the population
has expressed widespread approval of current urban
development policies. This resulted in a remarkable
outcome of the 1996 election that guaranteed the con-
tinuation of a governing political party for the ®rst time

510

in the history of the city. The paper argues that this
provided for continuity in stang, policies and organi-
sational culture which in practice sets the basis for
successful urban revitalisation processes and long-term
development planning.

substantial

changes

that

The most

these pro-
grammes present in relation to previous policies relate
to the involvement of civil society organisations in the
project preparation and implementation phases and
regarding the promotion of
`urban consolidation'
principles. Though the level of participation cannot be
compared to what is found in more politically pro-
gressive Brazilian local governments like for example
Porto Alegre where an institutionalised participatory
budgeting practice actually empowers public partici-
pation in public policy de®nition via prioritisation of
municipal investments in the city. In Rio de Janeiro,
neighbourhood associations were given a more limited
space to participate in project preparation allowing at
times for rejection of proposals formulated by the
municipality. But this represents a step forward in
municipal policies in the city. There is another re-
markable change in attitude towards the favelas ± in-
formal settlements. For the ®rst
time, a city-wide
favela upgrading ± with heavy public investments and
private sector participation in project planning and
implementation ± recognised the social and physical
exclusion and the opportunities for consolidation and
integration of these settlements into the city. Through
the programme called `Favela Bairro' the municipality
abandoned the ideas of resettlement, eviction and
`blind tolerance' that characterised municipal policies
until the beginning of the 1990's.

The paper describes some organisational and man-
agement settings established to make the municipal
government more ®nancially ecient. It also presents an
analysis of dierent programmes and strategic inter-
ventions such as the Strategic Plan of the City, the
Favela Bairro ± Informal Settlement Upgrading Pro-
gramme ± and the Rio Cidade ± Urban Revitalisation
Programme. These are city-wide interventions that
brought signi®cant changes in the urban fabric with
noticeable improvements in the functioning of the city.
The articulation between these programmes, the actors
involved and the co-ordination mechanisms as well as
civil society participation are further described. The
successes as well as the shortcomings are assessed in the
light of possible future directions and issues are identi-
®ed that still need to be addressed for the development
of the city.

2. The urban, social and political context

Rio de Janeiro is Brazil's second largest and one of its
two most important cities with S~ao Paulo. The city is

known by its peculiar beauty and natural environment ±
between sea and mountain ± having its geographic set-
ting as its most important asset and an image that at-
tract tourists from all over the world. It is also the seat
of many important knowledge-based institutions and a
signi®cant industrial park especially in the petrochemi-
cal and naval sectors. It is also an important commercial
and ®nancial centre with a well established service sector
especially in the ®nancial and technological domains,
oering a wide range of services in culture, leisure and
tourism that gives the city an international pro®le. In
1960 Rio lost to Brasilia its status as capital of Brazil
and seat of the national government but still retains the
headquarters of many central government agencies.
Without a doubt Rio is the most important cultural and
tourist centre of Brazil.

In economic terms the GNP of the municipality of
Rio de Janeiro is nearly US$50 billion for a population
of 6 million inhabitants. Rio's metropolitan region has
11 million inhabitants distributed among 13 municipal-
ities within a total area of 7.4 thousand km2 (Munici-
pality of Rio de Janeiro included) and with a GNP of
nearly US$80 billion (IPEA, 1998). Altogether, the
municipalities of Rio de Janeiro and S~ao Paulo ac-
commodate nearly 20% of the total Brazilian population
of 160 million inhabitants and their economy are re-
sponsible for more than 20% of the total GNP of the
country. The Rio±S~ao Paulo axis of 429 km is in fact the
heartland of Brazil's industrialisation and the engine of
Brazil's development.

Despite its economic potentials the metropolitan re-
gion of Rio de Janeiro is marked by sharp inequalities.
The disparities between the metropolitan core and its
periphery exacerbate social exclusion and poverty. It is
in the peripheral municipalities where a signi®cant pro-
portion of low income families and an unskilled labour
force ®nd housing accommodation and have access to
cheap land. This phenomenon further materialises a
severe social spatial strati®cation at the metropolitan
level. The concentration of wealth, employment, services
and entertainment in the core municipality result in a
sizeable and continuous commuting from the periphery
to Rio de Janeiro.

In the beginning of the 1990's Rio de Janeiro was
confronted with an increasing social tensions and direct
social impacts from the serious recession faced by the
country as whole. Low-income settlements and more
speci®cally the favelas had become the focal point of
violence and insecurity with the `narcotrac' practically
establishing a parallel power and local control to the
detriment of municipal norms and the rule of law. The
squatter residents' associations that were so active dur-
ing the 1980's were under continuous strain and the
local residents were subject to intimidation, fear and
were often caught in the middle of gun ®re from gangs
and police forces.

The city was facing social and spatial disintegration
when a new municipal government took oce in 1993
with the determination to re-establish urban governance
and to tackle at its roots what it called the `urban dis-
order and social exclusion'. The decision was to act
®rmly and to take advantage of spontaneous popular
mobilisation and demonstrations against all sorts of
urban problems, the violence and insecurity in the city.
The informal sector had taken over the streets with
street vendors mushrooming throughout the city putting
the public realm at stake. Public spaces and pedestrian
areas, even in such world-famous neighbourhoods as
Copacabana and Ipanema, had been taken over by
street vendors, cars and illegal extensions of shops and
businesses leaving no space for pedestrians to walk.
Municipal ®nance was not well organised and lacked
eciency due to the fact that the city cadastre had be-
come obsolete after years of neglect and lack of updat-
ing. Revenue collection had declined and the local
government structure showed signs of stagnation, failing
to respond to the challenges faced by the second largest
city in Brazil. The population had no con®dence in the
local government and the morale of the personnel was
low, with salaries not matching the responsibilities
(Acioly and Andreatta, 1998).

There was a plea to bring safety, harmony and live-
liness to public spaces. Civil society organisations were
united to recapture the image of the city and to ®ght for
social order. There were a series of public manifestations
that created opportunities for the population and its
organisations to get involved in the development of a
vision of the city and its future development. There was
also a change in the external economic and political
contexts caused by the National Economic Recovery
Plan ± Plano Real ± which managed to control in¯ation
and to bring stability to prices and monetary policy ±
something the Brazilians had been awaiting for an entire
decade. The municipal government took advantage of
these externalities to play a pro- active role against what
it called urban disorder.

Municipal action was also facilitated by the sub-
stantial degree of political, administrative and ®nancial
autonomy that a Brazilian municipality enjoys in com-
parison to many other developing and even developed
nations. As noted by Davey, Brazilian municipalities
have such powers that make them potentially among the
most comprehensive and independent
in the world
(Davey, 1996). Municipalities in Brazil have a consti-
tutionally protected autonomy and the power among
other things to determine their own organisation and
functions, have mayors and vice-mayors directly elected,
have the power to determine their own municipal con-
stitution (Lei Org^anica) and laws and have the auton-
omy to exploit their revenues. A city like Rio de Janeiro
has a tremendous potential to generate its own resources
and revenues if proper management and sound policies

are put into place. Paradoxically, municipal autonomy
represents a bottleneck within a context of conurbation
and a metropolitan region like Rio de Janeiro because it
makes it very dicult to achieve the required close co-
operation and co- ordination between independent local
governments in sectors such as urban environmental
management, public transport, infrastructure provision
and economic development planning.

3. Measures to accomplish institutional performance and
improved public sector management

The municipality restructured itself internally and a
new matrix management structure was established to
facilitate and increase cross-sector and horizontal co-
ordination. First-ranked municipal ocials and head of
municipal departments met regularly with the mayor to
accomplish a cohesive policy formulation and imple-
mentation. This group was called `G54' and the second-
ranked municipal ocial's group was named `G260'.
These numbers indicate the number of ocials involved
in each working group. The setting up of these groups
and their operation thereafter proved to be an important
management and communication tool for the mayor
within the municipal government. The role of each
group was clearly de®ned. G54 was geared to policy and
had a strong political character while G260 was execu-
tive in character and was geared to operational issues.
Nevertheless it helped to build ownership and high
commitment of the sta to the municipal policy goals
and strategies designed.

Five macro-function groups were formed according
to key development areas: social development, economic
development, urban development, city management and
®nance. Each group had one municipal secretariat as a
leadership to conduct governmental policies and to
achieve an articulated municipal strategy and was
therefore accountable to the mayor for its organisation
and implementation. The urban development group was
lead by the Secretariat of Urbanism under the leadership
of a distinguished architect, Luis Paulo Conde, who was
later elected and is currently the mayor of the city run-
ning for re-election in October 2000.

The emphasis was given to urban policies geared to
the rehabilitation of public spaces and the integration of
informal settlements into the urban fabric. Municipal
action should be equally divided among all territory
meaning that municipal budget expenditure should be
spread spatially abandoning previous practices of se-
lective and populist types of interventions. The principle
was to tackle the discrepancies found between neigh-
bourhoods in terms of public investments, infrastruc-
ture, and the quality of space and quality of life and to
reverse the processes of decline via public investment.

512

C. Acioly Jr. / Geoforum 32 (2001) 509±520

This approach was articulated with the actions and
programme initiatives undertaken within the scope of
the social and economic development macro-function
groups.

Horizontal

linkages and co-ordination were ar-
ranged, geared to eciency in resource use, decision-
making and setting of common goals. Top municipal
management meetings occurred regularly (at least once a
month) and were organised around themes. In these
meetings, the subjects were discussed and public policies
de®ned, establishing the roles of each secretariat and
municipal agency, streamlining co-ordination and re-
source allocation. The mayor and the top ocial head-
ing the municipal secretariats engaged in strategic
discussions and developed common visions at the G54
meetings that were further worked out in operational
and administrative terms at the lower level of the mu-
nicipal administration. All this was linked with creating
strict ®nancial management and ecient revenue col-
lection and a good city information system, aiming to
provide the mayor with the necessary and up- to-date
information for decision-making.

One of the most innovative measures was the estab-
lishment of the `Controladoria Geral do Municipio ±
CGM' or `®nancial control unit' that was legalised in
December 1993 nearly one year after the new adminis-
tration took oce (Law 2.068/1993). This was inspired
by the General Accounting Oce of the American
Government an autonomous entity that takes care ex-
clusively of the public accounting. The CGM in Rio de
Janeiro was an important tool created by the mayor ±
who was a professor of economics ± to control municipal
expenditures,
incomes and provide timely ®nancial
statements to allow proper municipal investment plan-
ning. Every programme, action or initiative that required
municipal resource allocation were properly checked and
immediately integrated into the budget control and ®-
nancial projections. This initiative brought transparency
to the municipal government, vis-a-vis the other political
powers like the Elected Municipal Council (Municipal
Chamber), the Tribunal of Accountant and the popula-
tion in general. This was an instrument used by the
mayor to prevent corruption and minimise fraud within
his administration. Rio was in fact the ®rst municipality
in Brazil to have such an entity exclusively in charge of
internal control of municipal ®nances. The main role of
the CGM is to exercise accounting, budgetary, opera-
tional and patrimonial control of the entire municipal
administration safeguarding the eciency in the man-
agement and use of public revenues. It also supports the
tribunal of accounting that is the place where municipal
®nance receives the ®nal auditing. The mission of CGM
is to make the municipal administration transparent
while helping to reduce public expenditure and promote
eciency and ecacy in the activities of the municipality.
This paid o as the municipality managed to generate a

sizeable surplus that allowed it to self-®nance several
urban interventions.

One of the most important systems of the CGM is the
Management Information System (SIG-Sistema de In-
formacß~oes Gerenciais). The SIG can provide within a
matter of few seconds strategic information for decision
making. For example, the total value of revenues col-
lected via each one of the main taxes (municipal, state
and federal), the total revenue and expenditures of each
month indicating whether there is de®cit or surplus, the
expenditures incurred by dierent municipal organisa-
tions and functions of the government, etc. Even the
degree of liability of the municipality on a daily basis as
well as of the 10 major projects under implementation
by the municipality can be provided through SIG.

Although some of the re-organisational measures
were never formalised in terms of municipal decree ap-
proved by the Elected Municipal Council, their actual
implementation gained a de facto character. This was
the case with the founding of sub-municipalities de®ned
as decentralised territorial branches of the municipal
government. Each sub-municipality was assigned to one
or more administrative region. It became an important
level of interface between local demand, local political
processes and the municipal government. The `sub-
mayor' was appointed by the mayor ± as a position of
con®dence ± and was assigned the task to articulate the
actions of dierent municipal agencies within its terri-
tory, work out municipal response to local demand and
channel them into the municipal apparatus. A critical
bottleneck in this decentralised form of urban manage-
ment was the lack a decentralised municipal budget and
the lack of authority of sub-mayors to actually decide on
resource allocation.

The changes in policies and ®nancial management
practices were meant to make the municipality more
responsive to externalities and facilitate quick decisions
regarding policy, investments, programmes, public se-
curity and the modernisation of the municipal appara-
tus. Besides the co-ordination within the macro-function
groups and the active management of municipal ®nance,
the municipality launched a strategic planning process
through which civil society organisations took part and
new ideas and new approaches to improve living con-
ditions in the city were designed. The strategic plan of
the city involved civil society organisations, neighbour-
hood associations, squatter residents' associations, pri-
vate
sector agencies,
universities, churches representatives, professional un-
ions, etc. The strategic plan's permanent assembly
gathered more than 1500 representatives in continuous
discussions that lead to solutions of many of Rio's ur-
gent problems (Strategic Plan for the City of Rio de
Janeiro, 1996). This was the ®rst strategic plan formu-
lated in Latin America to present a pragmatic view of
the opportunities and threats faced by Rio. Several

sector organisations, public

C. Acioly Jr. / Geoforum 32 (2001) 509±520

513

other programmes were designed and immediately put
in the pipeline. One achievement is the construction of
the strategic urban highway `Yellow Line', linking the
western and northern areas of the city, an investment of
US$250 million managed by a public±private partner-
ship (PPP) arrangement.

4. A municipal agency with a private sector performance:
IPP (former IPLANRIO)

In order to enhance performance of its apparatus a
municipal government must have to hand institutional
mechanisms and organisations capable of ¯exible and
timely responses to urban problems. This is exactly the
case of IPLANRIO, the Municipal Planning and In-
formation Agency. It is a municipal institution subor-
dinated directly to the mayor's oce and responsible for
the development and management of urban indicators
and for the formulation and implementation of urban
revitalisation projects, information dissemination, and
for the maintenance and updating of the ®scal and
physical cadastre of the city. In 1997, IPLANRIO was
restructured and split into two agencies. One strictly
concerned with the informatics, ®scal cadastre and ®-
nancial accounting and the other called IPP ± Municipal
Urban Institute Pereira Passos concerned with urban
planning, urban indicators, strategic projects, and urban
sector studies and programme management. The city's
digital cadastre and the management of the social and
economic indicators as well as the monitoring of the
favelas (informal settlements) are part of the myriad of
tasks performed by IPP. IPP works in close liaison with
private sector organisations and community-based or-
ganisations in the implementation of several urban re-
vitalisation projects like the Rio Cidade and the Favela
Bairro programmes.

The role of IPLANRIO and now IPP has been in-
strumental and strategic in modernising information
management within the municipality and in creating a
decision-support system for the municipality. With di-
rect access to the mayor's oce and with a ¯exibility and
mobility similar to private sector organisations IPP
manages to attract quali®ed professionals and to main-
tain a position of leadership within the municipal ap-
paratus. It elaborates urban projects, contracts out
project formulation and implementation, and supports
the implementation of these projects working together
with other municipal departments like the municipal
secretariats of Public Works, Housing, Urban Aairs
and also the Trac Authority and Municipal Light
Company. IPP is an active member of Macro Functions
Interdepartmental Working Groups like the one for
urban development. IPP is currently responsible for the
`informatisation' of the city's land register, the database
organisation, the computerised property-tax register and

service-tax register, and the collection and distribution
of key economic, physical and social data.

IPP has been also instrumental in the development
and updating of the city land register and a geographi-
cally referenced database linked to the property-tax
basis. Today, this represents a signi®cant source of
municipal revenue, which amounts to nearly US$1 bil-
lion. The Municipality of Rio hardly depends on
transfers from the Federal and State Governments,
which today represent only 32% of the municipal bud-
get. Local revenue collection had increased to a level
that allowed the municipality to build a reserve of US$1
billion for investments by the end of 1995 that were used
to launch the Favela Bairro and the Rio Cidade pro-
grammes. The city also issued municipal bonds and sold
them in the international market, generating a small
surplus of US$125 million. These revenues were funda-
mental
launching municipal development pro-
grammes as well as to ®nance its investment plans. The
income derived from applications of the reserves in the
®nancial market increased from US$26 million in 1993
to US$323 million in 1995. In 1998, municipal revenues
accounted R$3.6 billion Reais or US$2.1 billion.

for

Two key programmes gained popular support, so
much so as to in¯uence signi®cantly the results of the
municipal election of 1996 when a governing party was re-
elected for the ®rst time in the history of Rio de Janeiro
providing for continuity in policies, politics and in sta-
ing. The `Favela Bairro Programme' focused on the up-
grading of the favelas (informal settlements) and its
social, juridical and physical integration in the city via
public investment in infrastructure, community facilities,
public space management, participation and legalisation
of land tenure. The `Rio Cidade Programme' aimed at the
revitalisation of key corridors and focal points of con-
solidated neighbourhoods of the city by means of public
investment geared to modernisation of infrastructure and
recovery of their image and urban character. New designs
were implemented in public lighting, urban furniture, vi-
sual signalling of streets and public spaces, trac man-
agement, pavement, pedestrian routes, bicycle paths, etc.
Both programmes featured new forms of urban and
architectural design in the reshaping of the built-up
environment, as well as stimulating private- sector in-
volvement in the conception of projects and in the im-
plementation
the
municipality had to strengthen the capacity of its tech-
nical sta to properly guide and oversee programme and
project implementation, which involve a multitude of
public, private and community actors. A programme-
and project-management structure were setup to moni-
tor the entire project cycle, from its conception and
development to implementation and ®nal delivery to the
population. The bulk of these programmes were ®-
nanced directly from the municipal budget. The Favela
Bairro programme received counterpart (40%) ®nance

thereafter. This means

that

from the Inter American Development Bank (nearly
US$180 million).

5. Rio Strategic Plan:
implementation

innovating plan making and

The Strategic Plan of Rio was based on the same
approaches and planning methodologies used in the
formulation and implementation of Barcelona's Strate-
gic Plan. In fact, several consultants from Barcelona
worked in the elaboration of the plan of Rio. A vital
part of the process was the direct involvement of civil
society organisations during the entire process and the
mobilisation of ®nancial resources from the private
sector in order to ®nance the entire strategic planning
process. Several working groups were established and
had among its member's representatives from universi-
ties, churches, residents' associations, private sector in-
dustrial and commercial associations, professional
organisations, etc. The working groups prioritised is-
sues, clari®ed a new vision to the city and actually set up
the mechanisms for action.

The plan reports the direct involvement of 305 people
on the City Board and Board of Directors of the plan
representing renowned public, private, academic and
community organisations. One-hundred and nine per-
sons actively participated in the preparation of the di-
agnosis of the city while 323 got involved in the analysis
of the proposals for the city. Twenty-®ve dierent spe-
cialists were hired to prepare sector studies (Strategic
Plan for the City of Rio de Janeiro, 1996).

The plan mobilised agencies from the state and fed-
eral governments and increasingly involved private sec-
tor actors not only in the ®nancing of the plan but also
in the implementation of several strategies and projects.
An active working group that assembled various econ-
omists formed the basis for the creation of a new `Mu-
nicipal Secretariat'
strictly concerned with labour
questions. The new secretariat
focused on capacity
building of workers and labour markets that resulted in
Rio having one of the highest rates of employment
among the major cities in Brazil. The unemployment
rate in the city is 5.8% against the national rate of 7.7%
(O Globo, 2000).

6. Urban revitalisation: recapturing public spaces via the
Rio Cidade programme

The main objective of this programme was the urban
restructuring and revitalisation of vital commercial
streets situated in consolidated neighbourhoods of the
city and which are signi®cant for local image making
and that of the city of Rio de Janeiro. Previous studies
conducted by IPP revealed that physical deterioration

and economic decline in these areas were going hand in
hand. Poor quality of the urban environment and de®-
ciencies in street lighting, urban furniture,
landscape
planning, and inadequate provision of infrastructure
and public spaces for pedestrians and vehicles demanded
urgent public intervention. The programme was partic-
ularly addressing the inadequacy and obstructive char-
acter of public spaces and amenities that make the
circulation of pedestrians an unpleasant and at times a
dangerous endeavour.

The municipality decided to open the process of
planning and the design of alternatives to private sector
organisations providing a unique chance to consultants,
engineering and planning ®rms to participate in the re-
shaping of the city's public spaces. Together with the
IAB ± Institute of Architects of Brazil ± the municipality
organised via the IPP a public competition to develop
methodological suggestions, ideas and urban revitalisa-
tion strategies. The response was overwhelming.

In the ®rst phase of Rio Cidade Programme there
were 15 planning and architectural oces that were se-
lected and hired afterwards to further develop their
ideas and transform them into actual projects.
IPLANRIO (now IPP) co-ordinated the process on be-
half of the municipality and articulated concerted ac-
tions with other municipal agencies. IPP played a vital
role in cross-sector co-ordination between municipal
public utility agencies as well as other public, private
and community stakeholders required to manage and
implement a programme of this magnitude. For each
project, a project manager was assigned to manage the
entire project cycle until the ®nal delivery of its output
to the city. Rio Cidade's project managers were re-
sponsible for the entire process of project formulation
and implementation playing a pivotal role in the artic-
ulation between the various private, public, community
and political actors. This was an innovative step that
helped to make the programme ecient in problem
resolution, time management and resource use when
compared to other experiences of the municipality.

Dierent from other revitalisation projects previously
implemented in the city the Rio Cidade Programme
stimulated the involvement of the neighbourhood asso-
ciations who actively participated throughout the entire
project cycle, from project conception till ®nal imple-
mentation. This was an important new aspect of the
programme. It was a rather new step in getting more
transparency in plan making and implementation via a
consultative process. Several suggestions and objections
from residents and shopkeepers and business associa-
tions were incorporated into the ®nal projects. At times,
projects were totally rejected and forced to reformula-
tion. This provided a new dynamics to civil society
participation and strengthened public ownership of the
programme. This channel of communication allowed
the IPP to monitor more closely how local residents and

C. Acioly Jr. / Geoforum 32 (2001) 509±520

515

small businessmen were developing more interest in
municipal works at their residential areas and presenting
a more articulated demand in public space management.
The increasing interest and desire to voice opinions
during public meetings and consultations can be re-
garded as a sign of increase in self-esteem among the
population directly aected by the projects. On top of
that, IPP keeps a continuous channel of communication
with residents of project areas (and outside as well)
through which letters, telephone calls and conversations
are recorded, ®led, channelled through the municipality
± if it involves other departments ± and ®nally re-
sponded back to the citizen involved.

The principal points of the policy were to promote
urban consolidation in key areas of the city and to
abdicate from the `comprehensive city urbanism' and
urban redevelopment approaches that characterised
previous municipal
interventions. The programme
sponsored a series of simultaneous strategic revitalisa-
tion projects but took into account the linkage between
them and the neighbourhood where they were situated.
The Rio Cidade Programme relies on indigenous cre-
ativity and local resources directly drawn from the ci-
ty's budget. The entire city was subject
to urban
revitalisation actions and the idea was to irradiate ur-
banity surrounding the focal points of interventions of
the programme. The local business community in-
creasingly got involved in the revitalisation process and
responded positively with a signi®cant amount of pri-
vate investments in building improvement, renewal of
facades, face lift of shopping streets, business appeal
and public space management. All 15 projects of the
®rst phase were implemented resulting in complete re-
newal of infrastructure networks, public space planning
and management, redesign of urban furniture and cir-
culation with high degree of popular approval. 150
squares and public parks were rehabilitated within the
process.

A new competition was organised and 20 other ar-
eas are now subject to urban revitalisation initiatives
with a solid public investment programme behind it.
Actually, the municipality via the IPP has a data bank
of urban projects sucient to keep the city in contin-
uous process of urban renewal for the coming 10 years.
Financial resources have been allocated to ®nance the
second phase of Rio Cidade Programme which is equal
to the ®rst phase ± costing the equivalent of US$150
million ± drawn directly from the municipal budget.
Evolving from the experience and lessons learned with
this programme the municipality launched the RIO-
MAR (literally, Rio-Sea) waterfront management pro-
gramme geared to rehabilitate
spaces
situated in the waterfront of the city. The upgrading of
the world famous Parque do Flamengo ± designed by
Architect Burle Marx and known as one of the largest
urban parks in the world ± is now undergoing a pro-

the public

its plant

cess of conservation and restoration. This implies the
recovery of
stock and public amenities,
the refurbishment of the Museum of Modern Art, the
upgrading of public sports facilities and improvements
in public safety.

7. Integration of informal settlements: recapturing citi-
zenship rights

In 1994, the municipal government created a Mu-
nicipal Housing Secretariat (SMH) whose goal was to
formulate and implement a municipal housing policy
that could provide sustainable solutions to the various
facets of the housing problems unearthed in the city.
Dierent programmes were designed to address prob-
lems of low income families residing in irregular settle-
ments or illegal
land subdivisions; management and
maintenance problems found in existing public housing
estates implemented within the framework of the na-
tional housing ®nance system (1964±85). Also the
problems of the families living in settlements situated in
high risks areas and the homeless people living under
viaducts were also addressed by the new housing policy.
A speci®c programme was designed to address the
problems of the informal settlements ± favelas ± called
the Favela Bairro Programme (SMH, 1995). The pro-
gramme was launched and ®nanced by the municipal
budget but at a later stage the municipality managed to
increase its budget to more than US$300 million thanks
to a loan given by the IADB ± Inter American Devel-
opment Bank provided that the investments would not
exceed US$2500.00 per family (®rst phase of the pro-
gramme).

The programme did not start from scratch since the
knowledge about the problems of the favelas was well
internalised in the municipal apparatus. The 1991 census
survey had already disclosed the existence of 412 favelas.
Two years later an IPLANRIO's survey unveiled 570
settlements lodging an estimated population of 1.3 mil-
lion low income inhabitants or 21.6% of Rio's popula-
tion. It revealed poor infrastructure provision and
public services and in cases there was a total absence of
any kind of municipal services. Most of the favelas were
densely occupied with poor accessibility and with an
irregular urban con®guration that lacked open public
space. Land tenure was not regularised. The surveys
disclosed a noticeable change in the type of materials
utilised for the construction of the dwellings. A decrease
in wood and recyclable materials and increase of ce-
ramic bricks and concrete structures were evidence of a
consolidation process tolerated by previous municipal
governments. The favelas have increased in density and
have expanded onto steep hills and higher areas causing
deforestation, environmental degradation and increased

516

risks of landslides. The 1995 heavy rains showed the
vulnerability of many favelas causing substantial mate-
rial damage and loss of life.

The selection of the settlements for improvements
followed a clear set of criteria that took into consider-
ation (1) the size of the favela, (2) the degree of diculty
for physical upgrading, (3) the level of infrastructure in
place, and the (4) needs of the inhabitants. This would
have a direct eect on (5) the overall cost of upgrading.
Urbanisation indicators were developed and in the end
more than 100 favelas were excluded and 85 favelas were
prioritised for immediate action.

The main objective of the Favela Bairro programme
is to integrate informal settlements into the formal city
via settlement upgrading initiatives. This is meant to
transform favelas into liveable neighbourhoods where
one would ®nd roads and accesses, land titling, com-
munity and public services and amenities as in any other
place of the city. The municipality tackled social exclu-
sion with a solid public investment package that in-
volved the local population, various municipal agencies,
non-governmental organisations and professional asso-
ciations and private consulting ®rms. Similarly to the
Rio Cidade Programme, the municipality also innovated
in a number of aspects. In 1994, a public competition of
ideas and methodologies for favela upgrading was or-
ganised in partnership with the Brazilian Institute of
Architects ± IAB, based on which the SMH drew the
®rst 15 best proposals submitted by local planning and
architecture oces. These were awarded a contract to
develop upgrading plans in pre-selected settlements with
a clear instruction to work closely with the communities
in the design of plans and for delineating action plans
(see Fig. 1).

The programme stimulated physical integration as a
®rst step of the upgrading process meaning that there
was an emphasis on accessibility, opening and paving of
roads and the de®nition of public spaces. The pro-
gramme focused on public space management leaving
the household/private domain out of its priority pack-
ages. A settlement layout plan was a must and clearly
de®ned the public and private realms as an essential step
for the formalisation of land tenure and the citizenship
rights of the inhabitants. Real estate assets of favelas'
residents accordingly become part of the real estate
property cadaster and subject to the city's taxation but
at the same time their rights to demand access to and the
provision of infrastructure and public services are con-
sequently enhanced. The principle of the programme is
based on the axiom: citizenship implies rights and obli-
gations for both the citizen and the state (Acioly, 1997).
In order to implement the programme the SMH
created a programme management structure and estab-
lished cross-sector and inter-agency co-ordination
mechanisms to oversee the entire planning process from
plan formulation to ®nal implementation and comple-
tion of the works in each of the selected favelas. Like the
Rio Cidade Programme, project managers are assigned
important roles to guarantee that the development of
the projects and their implementation are carried out
according to the established principles and norms for
public tendering in Brazil. As showed in Fig. 1, the
project managers are the pivots of the management
system, linking dierent types of activities and the actors
responsible for their execution e.g. planning teams
(elaboration of projects and intervention plans), the
building contractors (construction activities) and the
community associations (®nal users and bene®ciaries).

The implementation process is also subject to public
tendering with the contractors selected in conformity
with their experience, capability statement, prices and
management capacity to execute public works of this
nature.

Until this date more than 450,000 residents have
bene®ted from the programme. In total, the Favela
Bairro Programme, together with the Bairrinho Pro-
gramme and the Improvement Programmes carried
out in the four Largest Favelas like Rocinha for ex-
ample, bene®ted 115 settlements at a total cost of
US$450 million. US$180 million was mobilised
through a loan from the Inter American Development
Bank, US$28 million from the National Savings Bank
± CEF and the European Union (allocated to Bairr-
inho) and US$80 million ®nanced by the CEF for the
improvement of the large favelas. The remainder is
drawn directly from the municipal budget. The second
phase of the Favela Bairro Programme prioritised 70
favelas while the Bairrinho 30 favelas nearly reaching
a total of 120 settlements. The estimated cost
is
US$320 million for a total population of 400,000
people.

The Favela Bairro Programme achieved a high degree
of satisfaction of the direct bene®ciaries and also public
approval by the city's population. Follow-up supervi-
sion shows that municipal investments are generating
individual private investments in housing improvement
and in building renewal. The residents are also getting
involved in management and maintenance of the bene-
®ts provided by the programme. In some settlements,
local community leaders and municipal sta report that
the narcotrac is relocating to other sites as opening of
roads and better accessibility corroborate to total
physical integration of the favelas to the surrounding
neighbourhoods. In the Boreu and Chacara do Ceu fa-
vela complex it is obvious that greater spatial trans-
parency and easy access of the police and public security
forces to higher and previously inaccessible parts of the
settlements have resulted in less violence and drug
tracking. ``An underlying, but not often explicitly ar-
ticulated, objective of the Favela Bairro Programme has
been to neutralise the in¯uence of organised crime in the
favelas of Rio and to bring back the presence of the
State to these areas, reinstate governance and restore
municipal authority, along with its laws, norms and
values after decades of neglect'' (Acioly et al., 1999). The
Municipality of Rio de Janeiro seems to have been
successful in doing this.

8. Attempts to become a global city in the 21st century

Needless to say that

the experience gained with
planning and managing complex urban projects, envi-
ronmental programmes and large-scale infrastructure

Information System. All

projects during the last eight years strengthened the lo-
cal government capacity not only to steer the future
development of the city but also to co-ordinate the
participation of various actors and stakeholders. Besides
that the institutional framework has been signi®cantly
improved as a result of a noticeable eort to establish a
professional management structure within the munici-
pality. Municipal ®nance has been well organised as well
placing the municipality in a comfortable position when
compared to other Brazilian cities. This has increased
the credibility of the local government in relation to
International funding agencies such as the Inter Amer-
ican Development Bank and the European Union, fa-
cilitating access to loans (and ®nancial resources) of
certain magnitude and allowing the continuation of
important municipal programmes. Rio de Janeiro's tax
base has improved and is reasonably accurate with a
direct linkage between the physical and the ®scal ca-
dastre and the city information system. An on-going
digital mapping programme under the responsibility of
IPP is creating an accurate cadastral basis and should
provide
local government's decision making with
immediate feedback and scenario's based on a GIS ±
Geographical
these man-
agement and administrative
initiatives depict an
outstanding eort of the municipality to mark the po-
sition of Rio de Janeiro in the global network of cities.
The Elected Municipal Council (Municipal Chamber)
has endorsed and approved the local government ini-
tiatives to expand private sector participation in the
management of particular municipal services. Public
concessions up to 10 and 30, and in some cases 50 years
have been approved for construction and management
of underground parking facilities, the sewerage network
at Barra da Tijuca, Yellow Line Urban Highway (with
®rst urban toll system in Brazil), the optic ®bre network,
etc. Public±private partnership ± PPP has been also
applied in the transfer of development rights helping to
promote redevelopment and preservation projects in
several locations of the city. The city strategic plan is
another tool focusing on mobilisation of private sector
resources ± nationally and internationally ± in order to
allow the city to continue investing in the research and
knowledge sectors, infrastructure as well as in its tour-
ism and natural environmental assets. The local gov-
ernment wants to consolidate an image of a well-
functioning city that is concerned with the quality of life
of its inhabitants, a fact that explains the special atten-
tion given by municipal interventions to the quantity,
quality and image of its public space. Like Rotterdam
and Berlin and other major European cities, Rio de
Janeiro is launching selective design competitions to
attract well-known foreign architects to help the local
government to design ¯agship projects for the inner-city
revitalisation programme which includes the realisation
of teleport projects, revival of housing in downtown

518

areas and the waterfront redevelopment. The legislation
has been adjusted paving the way for densi®cation and
revitalisation and the return of housing to downtown
areas. The municipality is particularly attentive to de-
velopments in the Mercosur, the common market of the
South Cone of Latin America, and intends to use its
image to attract the establishment of branches and
headquarters of important trans-national corporations.
On top of
the city administration is always
prepared to host big events like the Olympic Games (lost
to Sydney), the recent Simeira of Chief of States, the
world congress of IULA ± International Union of Local
Authorities and other types of sport events that provide
additional fuel in city marketing.

that,

While one must give credit to the current city ad-
ministration for the apparent success in urban renewal
and physical revitalisation that have a direct eect on
the economic positioning of the city, there is still a lot
to be done to resolve social exclusion and urban
poverty. Despite the fact that Rio de Janeiro has the
lowest unemployment rate of the major urban ag-
glomerations in Brazil
it is still far from resolving
critical inequalities within its urban fabric particularly
when its metropolitan region is taken into account.
There is hope for changes when one considers the
establishment of the Municipal Secretariat for Em-
ployment and the various capacity building initiatives
geared to increase the quality of the labour force in
the city. Another challenge for the local government
remains the public safety and the problems of crimi-
nality and violence that still co-exist with all these
success stories that lead Rio de Janeiro to the 21st
century.

9. Conclusions and lessons learned

On the political side, the continuity in policies, sta-
ing, organisational culture and team work within the
municipality can be regarded as one of the keys to the
success of the urban revitalisation process in Rio de
Janeiro. Opinion polls carried out within the recent
political campaigns underscored a signi®cant public
approval for the positive changes introduced in the city
by the current administration. According to research
undertaken by JB-DataUFF-America Online, the cur-
rent mayor has a remarkable level of approval by 68.6%
of the population who considers his administration good
or excellent (JB, 2000). This trend may result in his re-
election in the upcoming municipal election (2000) and
would provide an unprecedented continuity of the gov-
erning party for three terms of four years or a total of 12
years since 1993. Few cities in Brazil have enjoyed this
situation. Curitiba is the most well known case with
mayor Jaime Lerner occupying the mayor's seat for
three dierent terms of four years since 1971 while

managing to name his successor on most occasions
guaranteeing a unique continuity in policies and mu-
nicipal administration. The success stories of Curitiba
and its urban and environmental management are a
function of this continuity. Porto Alegre is another city
that has been governed for three consecutive terms of
four years by the same political party ± PT (Labour
Party) allowing the city administration to enjoy conti-
nuity and substantial popular support. The population
of both cities reports high levels of satisfaction with the
municipal administration that is validated in the local
elections and that has paved the way to institutionali-
sation and long-term planning at the local government
level.

funding agencies were

On the management side, the restructuring of mu-
nicipal ®nance and the tight control on municipal rev-
enues and expenditures that were established in the
beginning of the ®rst administration (1993) in Rio
provided the municipality with the fundamental
in-
house resources to launch city-wide revitalisation pro-
grammes. Additional funding from national and inter-
national
tapped into the
programmes. In fact, the availability of resources com-
bined with an action-orientated type of planning sup-
ported by a truly autonomous municipality and political
will propelled the changes experienced by Rio de Ja-
neiro. These elements should be considered as a sine-
qua-non condition for successful urban interventions in
a city of the magnitude and complexity of Rio de Ja-
neiro. Innovations at the programme and project man-
agement levels as described for Rio Cidade and Favela
Bairro Programmes should also be regarded as an in-
tegral eort to establish an eective and result-oriented
public sector management at the municipal level. This
papers pinpoints the linkage between management
change and public sector eciency but there is a need to
further investigate these linkages and unearth concrete
evidences and empirical data that may help local gov-
ernments to improve their response to its external en-
vironment.

On the planning side, the experience of Rio de Janeiro
gives further evidence that to cope with a fast growing
and dynamic metropolis of this size, a local government
must move away from the traditional city-wide pre-
scriptive master planning. It must abandon the para-
digms of modernism that advocates among other things
strict zoning regulations, demolition and resettlement of
informal settlements. A ¯exible type of planning that
recaptures the principles of action plans and large inte-
grated projects focused on strategic sites of the city seem
to provide better instruments to urban restructuring and
citizen involvement. However, one must bare in mind
that the municipal apparatus with its traditions and
more than 500 laws and norms in use represented a
paramount bottleneck to overcome. The case of Rio
shows that organisational restructuring, cross-cutting

C. Acioly Jr. / Geoforum 32 (2001) 509±520

519

co-ordination, strong leadership and training of mu-
nicipal personnel are the keys to surpass the barriers of
tradition and institutional stagnation. Furthermore, the
strategic plan of the city encouraged the deregulation
and `¯exibilisation' of planning and managed to estab-
lish an important link between economic thinking and
private and public investments to urban planning in-
tervention.

When it comes to tackling social exclusion and urban
poverty via the upgrading and integration of favelas into
the formal city then some limitations of the approach
start to become evident. The recognition of the potential
of informal settlements and the design and implemen-
tation of a city-wide informal settlement upgrading and
regularisation programme is indeed a breakthrough in
the management of the city especially when one con-
siders that this is only one of the various programmes
that form the municipal housing policy. The mobilisa-
tion of additional funding from the Inter American
Development Bank and the European Union to imple-
ment the Favela Bairro and Bairrinho programmes is a
guarantee for the continuation of a large scale and
multi-settlement project. However, it proved that the
Secretariat of Housing was not prepared to take this
paramount responsibility and had to contract out pro-
gramme management to a private management consul-
tant (gerenciadora). This is a risk for capacity building
of indigenous resources and institution building and
may aect the `internalisation' of management processes
and procedures. The approach used by IPP to undertake
the Rio Cidade programme provides better indications
that the public sector is perfectly capable of managing
the entire project cycle in a multi-project urban revi-
talisation program, including neighbourhood consulta-
tions.

The Favela Bairro projects still focus on physical
improvements and heavy infrastructure investments
limiting the participation of the residents to the project
preparation phase although the orthodoxy of public
investments generating private investments holds in the
cases of both Favela Bairro and Rio Cidade projects. It
is worth noting that the second phase of the programme
emphasises social economic development and addresses
employment generation and supports the establishment
of micro-enterprises in a well-structured manner. An-
other shortcoming of the programme is that the ®nal
`regularisation' and juridical integration has not been
realised despite the fact that nearly 22,000 families have
received their land title in dierent informal settlements.
Complex and time consuming land regularisation pro-
cedures are impeding the total integration of the favelas
into the formal city thus impeding the Favela Bairro
programme achieving one of its most fundamental ob-
jectives.

It is noticeable that a signi®cant amount of the
municipal budget has been allocated to areas and

neighbourhoods that were never recipients of heavy
public investment. Nevertheless the disparity still re-
mains between the southern and northern zones of the
city. And despite the apparent success of several mu-
nicipal programmes like the Favela Bairro Programme
and the packages of heavy public investments in poorer
areas of Rio de Janeiro the municipal government is far
from resolving the critical levels of social, physical and
economic exclusion in the city. Furthermore, the di-
chotomy between Rio de Janeiro and its metropolitan
region has further stretched and may drive urban vio-
lence to levels that severely aect public safety in the
city.

The economy of Rio de Janeiro has partially recov-
ered and the relatively low level of unemployment gives
optimism to its population that is responding positively
to the urban revitalisation programmes. Violence has
decreased in the informal settlements where municipal
intervention took place has not ceased in the city as a
whole. The question remains whether a single local
government has the means and instruments to resolve a
problem that is structural of the Brazilian society and
that goes beyond the jurisdiction of its territory. Several
other problems that cannot be resolved alone by Rio's
local government such as environmental problems,
trac congestion, public transport, sewerage systems
remain unresolved because they require working in close
liaison with municipalities of the metropolitan region.
The solution to industrial pollution, water source con-
tamination, the sedimentation of the Guanabara bay
and the air quality depend on co-ordination of the city
government with other levels of government and also
with its neighbouring municipalities of the metropolitan
region. Despite the successes of municipal programmes,
attempting to solve its major problems alone will not
provide Rio with a sustainable solution to many of its
problems and will put at stake its position as a global
city in the 21st century.
