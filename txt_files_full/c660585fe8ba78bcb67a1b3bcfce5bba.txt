Discovery of the reverse 

transcriptase 

Historical facts 

1944 – Oswald Avery – provides first evidence that Griffith‘s transforming agent is 
DNA 

1952 – Alfred Hershey & Martha Chase – „Waring blender“ experiment with 
bacteriophages shows DNA is the carrier of genetic information 

1953 – James Watson & Francis Crick – publish „double helix“ model of DNA, using 
Röntgen diffraction data of Rosalin Franklin 

1953 – Fred Sanger – develops method to determine amino acid sequence of 
proteines 

1958 – Francis Crick  - Central Dogma 

1966 – Marshall Nirenberg , Robert Holley & Har Khorana – crack the genetic code 
and discover how DNA is translated in protein 

 

 

The Central Dogma of molecular 

biology 

●

●

'Paradigm' published by Francis Crick 1958 

„DNA makes RNA and RNA makes Protein“  → 'One way street'

Temin vs. Baltimore 

●

In the `70s, both were working on the Rous sarcoma 
virus (RSV) 

● RSV is named after Peyton Rous 

– Found that this virus causes tumors in chickens 

 Statement: Since anything larger than a virus was 
filtered out, the implications were that viruses caused 
tumors 

 

            Howard Temin 

 

● Developed a heretical notion that RSV 

 

 

●

 

must be carried in an integrated 

DNA-form in infected cells (late 1950's) 

Temin was looking for a stable 

host-virus-relationship 

Fig. 2 Howard Temin 

● Key argument: RSV that gave mutated morphologies to cells did this very 

stable 

● Question: How could RSV-RNA integrate into cellular DNA? 

 

 

 

● Solution: If RNA were copied into DNA, it can be integrated 

like a lysogenic phage DNA (Prophage) and it could be 
transcripted back into RNA 

● Experimental proof with Actinomycin D which binds only 

DNA, not RNA 

→ Actinomycin inhibited RSV what was a strong argument for an 
DNA intermediate in RSV 

● BUT uncertainties about specificity and secondary effects 

invalidated Temin's proof!!! 

 

Key-question: 

● How does RSV might use its RNA as a template to 

make DNA? 

→ The experiment that finally convinced the world came 
to mind of two scientists about  the same time 

●

They needed to show that the RNA-dependent DNA 
polymerase might be packaged in the virions 

David Baltimore 

Baltimore stripped the 
virus of its outer coat and 
used the inner core in a 
cell-free system 

Added all the nucleotides 
(thymine was the 
radioactive tracer) 

The viral components in 
this cell-free system 
produced radioactive 
product

Fig. 3: Experiment to proof if it‘s DNA or RNA 

David Baltimore 

 

 

First statement: The radioactive product is DNA 
because it was not effected by RNase but it was 
destroyed by the enzyme DNase; The template 
is the RNA oft the virus 

David Baltimore 

● He incubated the viral 

cores with trypsin  

● Then he added 

nucleotides to the trypsin-
degested viral cores 

 He did not get any DNA 
product 

Fig. 4: Experiment to show that 
there is a special enzyme for the way 
from RNA to DNA  

David Baltimore 

● He added RNase at the 

beginning of the 
reaction 

● Added nucleotides 

 There also was no DNA 
product! 

Fig. 5: Experiment to show that 
there is a special enzyme for the way 
from RNA to DNA  

David Baltimore 

 

Second statement: He included that RSV has a 
special enzyme that uses RNA as a template to 
make DNA and named this enzyme „RNA-
dependent DNA polymerase“

● Density-Gradient 

Centrifugation  of a virus 
suspension in a sucrose 
gradient 

●

Suspension was incubated with 
radiolabeled 
deoxyribonucleotides 

● Test for the activity of RNA-

dependent DNA polymerase 

Fraction 10 : The virions are 
located and the highest activity 
was detected

polymerase

Third statement: The enzyme („RNA-dependent 
DNA Polymerase“) is located in the virons  

Crashing the central dogma 

● Crick‘s central dogma does not apply to viruses like 

RSV 

● A reverse flow of information from RNA to DNA 

happens first 

These viruses thus became known as retroviruses 

The discovery of reverse transcriptase helped to 
clarify the life cycle of RSV and other retroviruses
