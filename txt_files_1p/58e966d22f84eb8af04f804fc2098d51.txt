Toward a Dynamic Theory of Global
Production Networks

and

through

t Global production networks (GPN) are organiza-
c
tional platforms through which actors in different
a
regional and national economies compete and coop-
r
erate for a greater share of value creation, transfor-
t
mation,
geographically
s
b
dispersed economic activity. Existing conceptual
a
frameworks on global value chains (GVC) and what
we term GPN 1.0 tend to under-theorize the origins
and dynamics of these organizational platforms and
to overemphasize their governance typologies (e.g.,
modular, relational, and captive modes in GVC
theory) or analytical categories (e.g., power and
embeddedness in GPN 1.0). Building on this expand-
ing literature, our article aims to contribute toward
the reframing of existing GPN-GVC debates and the
development of a more dynamic theory of global
production networks that can better explain the emer-
gence of different ﬁrm-speciﬁc activities, strategic
network effects, and territorial outcomes in the
global economy. It is part of a wider initiative—GPN
2.0 in short—that seeks to offer novel theoretical
insights into why and how the organization and coor-
dination of global production networks varies sig-
niﬁcantly within and across different
industries,
sectors, and economies. Taking an actor-centered
focus toward theory development, we tackle a sig-
niﬁcant gap in existing work by systematically con-
ceptualizing the causal drivers of global production
networks in terms of their competitive dynamics
(optimizing cost-capability ratios, market impera-
tives, and ﬁnancial discipline) and risk environments.
These capitalist dynamics are theorized as critical
independent variables that shape the four main strat-
egies adopted by economic actors in (re)conﬁguring
their global production networks and, ultimately, the
developmental outcomes in different
industries,
regions, and countries.
