Abstract

Background: Alu elements are major contributors to lineage-specific new exons in primate and human genomes.
Recent studies indicate that some Alu exons have high transcript inclusion levels or tissue-specific splicing profiles,
and may play important regulatory roles in modulating mRNA degradation or translational efficiency. However, the
contribution of Alu exons to the human proteome remains unclear and controversial. The prevailing view is that
exons derived from young repetitive elements, such as Alu elements, are restricted to regulatory functions and have
not had adequate evolutionary time to be incorporated into stable, functional proteins.
Results: We adopt a proteotranscriptomics approach to systematically assess the contribution of Alu exons to the
human proteome. Using RNA sequencing, ribosome profiling, and proteomics data from human tissues and cell
lines, we provide evidence for the translational activities of Alu exons and the presence of Alu exon derived
peptides in human proteins. These Alu exon peptides represent species-specific protein differences between
primates and other mammals, and in certain instances between humans and closely related primates. In the case of
the RNA editing enzyme ADARB1, which contains an Alu exon peptide in its catalytic domain, RNA sequencing
analyses of A-to-I editing demonstrate that both the Alu exon skipping and inclusion isoforms encode active
enzymes. The Alu exon derived peptide may fine tune the overall editing activity and, in limited cases, the site
selectivity of ADARB1 protein products.
Conclusions: Our data indicate that Alu elements have contributed to the acquisition of novel protein sequences
during primate and human evolution.

Background
Transposable elements have played important roles in
the evolution of gene regulation and function [1]. The
primate-specific Alu retrotransposon is
the most
abundant class of transposable elements in the human
genome, with over 1 million copies occupying over 10 %
of the human genomic DNA [2]. Although Alu elements
were historically considered as ‘junk DNA’, extensive re-
search in the past two decades has revealed significant
contributions of Alu to the evolution of the human
genome and gene regulatory networks [1–3].

Alu is a major contributor to de novo origination of
lineage-specific exons in primates [4]. Because the Alu
element contains multiple sites
resemble the
consensus donor and acceptor splice site signals, the in-
sertion of Alu elements into intronic regions of existing
genes produces preferable substrates for subsequent mu-
tations that create and establish new exons [4, 5]. The
exonization of Alu elements is frequent during primate
and human evolution – thousands of human genes con-
tain Alu-derived exon segments in their mRNA tran-
scripts [6, 7]. Although the majority of Alu exons have low
splicing activities and probably represent non-functional
evolutionary intermediates, a subset of Alu exons have
acquired ubiquitously strong or tissue-specific splicing ac-
tivities in human tissues, as demonstrated by recent tran-
scriptome studies using splicing-sensitive exon microarray

and deep RNA sequencing [8, 9]. These ‘established’
Alu exons are preferentially located in the mRNA 5’
untranslated regions (5’-UTR) and may play a role in
regulating mRNA translational efficiency [6, 8, 9]. Alu
exons inserted into coding regions of protein-coding
genes frequently contain premature termination codons
(PTCs) and may provide a mechanism for fine-tuning
steady-state mRNA levels by inducing mRNA nonsense-
mediated decay (NMD) [10]. Together, these data have
established the regulatory roles of Alu exons in multiple
aspects of RNA metabolism including translation and
degradation.

Despite the prevalence of Alu exons in the human
transcriptome, the contribution of Alu exons to the
human proteome remains unclear and controversial
[11–15]. In the 1990s and early 2000s, Makałowski and
others carried out large-scale discoveries of Alu exons in
human genes using cDNA sequences and expressed
sequence tags (ESTs) [11, 12, 16]. They identified nu-
merous instances of ‘in-frame’ Alu exons in the coding
region of human mRNAs that are predicted to add Alu-
derived peptides to the protein products. However, the
presence of an in-frame Alu exon in the mRNA coding
sequence does not guarantee its translation and incorp-
oration into stable protein products. Additionally, since
most Alu exons have low splicing activities [6, 16], even
a ‘translatable’ coding-region Alu exon may only be in-
corporated into a small fraction of the gene’s transcript
products and consequently become largely undetectable
and negligible on the protein level. In fact, in these stud-
ies there was little experimental evidence to support the
existence of Alu-derived peptides in vitro or in vivo. In
2006, Makalowski and colleagues revisited this question
by searching for transposable elements derived peptides in
non-redundant protein entries in the Protein Databank
(PDB) [13]. Since all proteins in PDB have solved 3D
structures, Makalowski and colleagues reasoned that PDB
provides a high-confidence collection of stable, functional
proteins. They did not identify any Alu derived pep-
tides in PDB protein entries. On the basis of this re-
sult, Makalowski and colleagues concluded that exons
derived from Alu or other young repetitive elements
do not have adequate evolutionary time to be incor-
porated into stable protein products, and the role of
Alu exons should be almost entirely regulatory [13].
Since then, this has become the prevailing view on
the contribution of Alu exons to the human proteome
[3, 14, 15, 17]. However, this PDB-based study also
has major drawbacks. Most importantly, PDB has very
limited coverage of alternatively spliced protein isoforms,
and less than 10 protein isoforms had structures deposited
in PDB by the time of this study [18]. When structural bi-
ologists select proteins for structural characterization,
there is an inherent bias towards selecting evolutionarily

conserved protein isoforms and against protein isoforms
with non-conserved (lineage-specific) exon segments such
as Alu exons. Therefore,
the presence of Alu exon
peptides in the human proteome may be significantly
underestimated in the PDB-based analysis. Indeed,
in
gene-specific studies, researchers have found evidence for
the expression of Alu exon peptides in vitro or in vivo –
two examples being the Alu exons in genes encoding the
RNA editing enzyme ADARB1 [19] and DNA methyl-
transferase DNMT1 [20]. Neither case was recapitulated
in the PDB study [13]. In summary, despite substantial
interest in this topic, the real contribution of Alu exons to
the human proteome remains unclear, and past studies
may have reached dramatically different conclusions due
to inherent limitations of their data sources.

In this work, we adopted a proteotranscriptomics ap-
proach to systematically assess the contribution of Alu
exons to the human proteome. Using RNA sequencing
(RNA-seq), ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq), and mass
spectrometry data of diverse human tissues and cell lines,
we evaluated the evidence for the translational activities of
Alu exons and the presence of Alu exon derived peptides
in human proteins.

Results
RNA-seq discovery of putative coding Alu exons with
high splicing activities
RNA-seq has become a powerful approach for quantita-
tive analyses of exon splicing [21]. We previously used an
RNA-seq dataset of human cerebellum to characterize the
splicing profiles of Alu exons [9]. Among Alu exons with
high splicing levels (>50 % exon inclusion) in the cerebel-
lum according to this RNA-seq analysis, the vast majority
(over 80 %) were located in the mRNA 5’-UTR, and only a
handful were located within the protein-coding region [9].
In the present work, to comprehensively identify putative
coding Alu exons and characterize their splicing activities,
we used a much larger RNA-seq dataset with approxi-
mately 1.8 billion RNA-seq reads covering 19 human tis-
sues, including 16 tissues from the Illumina Human Body
Map 2.0 dataset and three tissues from different anatom-
ical compartments of the human placenta (see Materials
and Methods).

We implemented a computational pipeline to identify
putative coding Alu exons with high splicing activities
(Fig. 1a and Materials and Methods). Briefly,

included into the transcripts. Specifically, PTCs were de-
fined as stop codons located more than 50 bp upstream of
the last exon-exon junction of the mRNA [22]. These 262
non-PTC exons were considered as candidate protein-
coding Alu exons that had the potential to add Alu-de-
rived peptides to the protein products. Of note, 69 %
(182/262) of these candidate protein-coding Alu exons
were divisible by 3 in exon length while only 24 %
(159/649) of the putative NMD-inducing Alu exons
were divisible by 3 (Fisher’s exact
test P = 2e-36).
Next, we performed detailed RNA-seq analyses on
these exons to identify those with moderate-to-high
levels of
splicing activities
among human tissues. For each exon, we calculated
its
(denoted as percent-
spliced-in, or Ψ [23]) in a given tissue using RNA-seq
reads uniquely mapped to the upstream, downstream,
and exon-skipping splice junctions (see Materials and
Methods). To ensure accurate estimation of the transcript
inclusion level, we required that at least one splice junc-
tion (upstream, downstream, or exon-skipping) had at
least 10 reads. We identified 48 Alu exons with transcript
inclusion levels of at least 33 % in one of the human tis-
sues, indicating moderate-to-high levels of exon splicing.
In parallel, we performed pairwise tissue comparisons
using the MATS algorithm for differential splicing analysis
[24] and identified 27 Alu exons with at least 10 % change
in transcript inclusion levels (that is, |ΔΨ| ≥10 %) be-
tween at least one pair of tissues (false discovery rate

(FDR) <10 %),
indicating differential splicing among
human tissues. The vast majority of these differen-
tially spliced Alu exons (23/27) were also among the
48 exons with at least 33 % transcript inclusion levels
in at least one of the human tissues. In total, we ob-
tained 52 Alu exons by combining these two exon
lists (Fig. 1b and Additional file 1: Table S1). These
results indicate that although Alu exons with high
splicing levels are preferentially located within the 5’-
UTR [6, 8, 9], there is a reasonably large number of
putative protein-coding Alu exons with high splicing
activities in human tissues.

Translational and proteomic evidence for protein-coding
Alu exons
To systematically assess the proteomic evidence for Alu
exon derived peptides in human proteins, we queried
the 262 putative coding Alu exons in Ensembl tran-
scripts (Fig. 1a) against the PRoteomics IDEntifications
Database (PRIDE) [25]. PRIDE is a comprehensive re-
pository for proteomics data, containing protein and
peptide sequences as well as their supporting spectral
evidence from mass
spectrometry experiments. We
searched PRIDE peptide sequences against the putative
open reading frames (ORFs) of Alu exon inclusion
transcripts as well as the ORFs of all other human
transcripts. We excluded peptide sequences mapped to
multiple locations in human ORFs. Then we defined a
putative protein-coding Alu exon as having a peptide

match in PRIDE if
there was a peptide sequence
uniquely mapped to the translated peptide sequence
from the exon body or the splice junctions spanning the
Alu exon and its upstream or downstream flanking exon.
Of the 262 putative coding Alu exons, 85 had peptide
evidence in the PRIDE database (Fig. 1a and Additional
file 2: Table S2). Of note, 69 of these 85 (81 %) Alu
exons had peptide sequences crossing the upstream or
downstream splice junctions (Additional
file 2: Table
S2). Because the flanking exons of most Alu exons are
not derived from repetitive elements, these splice junction
spanning peptide sequences provide stronger evidence
that these putative coding Alu exons are translated into
protein sequences. Among the 52 putative protein-coding
Alu exons with RNA-seq evidence for high splicing activ-
ities in human tissues, 18 had peptide matches in PRIDE
(Fig. 1b and Table 1). A few examples are shown in Fig. 1c.
In NEK4 (ENSG00000114904) we found six peptide
sequences in PRIDE that mapped to the upstream or
downstream splice junction of the Alu exon. In ALG8
(ENSG00000159063), the Alu exon was predicted to
encode a different C-terminal peptide of the protein –
this Alu exon peptide was supported by a peptide
sequence in PRIDE. Another example was MCM3
(ENSG00000112118). In this gene, Alu exon inclusion
caused a frameshift in the downstream 3’ terminal
exon, which resulted in a distinct C-terminal peptide
by using a different reading frame within the same ter-
minal exon. We found peptide sequences in PRIDE that
mapped to either the Alu exon or the downstream
splice junction. In addition to the PRIDE analysis, we
also manually searched the 52 putative protein-coding
Alu exons with high splicing activities against a second
mass spectrometry database PeptideAtlas [26]. Differ-
ent from PRIDE, PeptideAtlas reprocessed the original
protein mass spectrometry data using stringent FDR
criteria [26]. Therefore, PeptideAtlas has a very low
false positive rate at the expense of a higher false nega-
tive rate. Our manual search against PeptideAtlas iden-
tified the peptide evidence for Alu exons in SUGT1
(ENSG00000165416) and DNMT1 (ENSG00000130816),
both were also supported by PRIDE (Table 1). Overall,
among the 52 putative coding Alu exons with high spli-
cing activities, 18 (35 %) had peptide evidence in either
PRIDE alone or both PRIDE and PeptideAtlas. It should
be noted that this percentage is expected to be an
underestimate, since peptide identification from prote-
omics experiments is biased towards highly expressed
proteins [27].

To obtain an independent line of evidence for the
translation of these putative coding Alu exons into pro-
tein products, we analyzed the footprint of ribosomes on
Alu exons using ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) data.
Ribo-seq has recently been developed as a powerful

approach for high-throughput analyses of protein trans-
lation [28]. Here we jointly analyzed the Ribo-seq and
RNA-seq data of HeLa cells
[29]. Specifically, we
mapped the Ribo-seq and RNA-seq reads to the up-
stream, downstream, and exon-skipping splice junctions
of Alu exons, and computed each Alu exon’s transcript
inclusion levels in the Ribo-seq and RNA-seq data, re-
spectively (Materials and Methods). To ensure reliable
estimation of transcript inclusion levels, we restricted
this analysis to Alu exons with at least 10 reads mapped
to one of three splice junctions in both Ribo-seq and
RNA-seq data. As shown in Fig. 2a, among the 76
putative coding Alu exons that met this criterion, 38
exons had non-zero transcript inclusion levels in the
Ribo-seq data, indicating ribosome footprints translat-
ing through the Alu exons. Seventeen exons had tran-
script inclusion levels of at least 15 % in the Ribo-seq
data. Of note, 15 Alu exons had higher transcript in-
clusion levels in the Ribo-seq data than in the RNA-
seq data (Fig. 2a and Additional file 3: Table S3), sug-
gesting that the Alu exon inclusion mRNA isoform
was translated at a comparable or even higher rate as
compared to the ancestral mRNA isoform lacking the
Alu exon. The Ribo-seq and RNA-seq signals of four Alu
exons were shown in Fig. 2b-e. These include Alu
exons with PRIDE or PeptideAtlas evidence (DNMT1
(ENSG00000130816), BIRC5 (ENSG00000089685)), as
well as
(SRP9 (ENSG00000143742),
METTL10 (ENSG00000203791)). Of note, in both SRP9
and METTL10, the Alu exon was the penultimate exon,
and the stop codon of the Alu exon inclusion mRNA iso-
form was located either within the Alu exon (SRP9) or in
the immediate downstream terminal exon (METTL10). In
both cases the Ribo-seq signal diminished beyond the
stop codon (Fig. 2d, e). We note that nine Alu exons
with PRIDE peptide sequences had no Ribo-seq reads
mapped to the exon inclusion splice junctions, includ-
ing three exons with RNA-seq transcript
inclusion
levels of over 50 % (Additional file 3: Table S3). This
may be attributed to cell-type-specific differences in
protein translation between the HeLa cells and other
tissues and cell types.

We found that putative protein-coding Alu exons had
a lower percentage of exons derived from the AluY sub-
family, which was the youngest subfamily of Alu elements
in the human genome [30]. In total, 4.2 % (11/262) puta-
tive protein-coding Alu exons were AluY derived, com-
pared to 7.0 % (121/1734) for other Alu exons. Moreover,
protein-coding Alu exons with PRIDE evidence had the
lowest percentage of AluY (2.4 %, 2/85). These differences
were not statistically significant (Fisher’s exact test, P = ap-
proximately 0.1), which may be attributed to small sample
size. However, the trend was interesting and consistent
with the notion that it required time for Alu exons to

Assessment of transcriptomic and proteomic evidence for
protein-coding Alu exons
We performed a series of analyses to further assess the
transcriptomic and proteomic evidence for protein-
coding Alu exons. First, to validate the splicing of these
exons, we randomly selected 20 protein-coding Alu
exons, and used fluorescently labeled RT-PCR to verify
their exon inclusion patterns and quantify their splicing
levels in a diverse panel of 21 human tissues (Additional
file 4: Table S4). Nineteen out of the 20 exons were
validated to be spliced into the human transcriptome
(Additional file 5: Figure S1). This high validation rate
(19 out of 20) was consistent with our previous RT-
PCR and sequencing confirmation of UTR Alu exons
identified by RNA-seq [9], confirming that our RNA-
seq identification of Alu exon splicing had a very high
accuracy. Second, we further assessed the Ribo-seq
signal of protein-coding Alu exons in HeLa cells,
using putative NMD-inducing Alu exons in protein-
coding genes as the control. Seventeen out of 76
protein-coding Alu exons with sufficient Ribo-seq
coverage had transcript
least
15 % in the Ribo-seq data, as compared to 24 out of
180 for putative NMD-inducing Alu exons. We ob-
served an increase in Ribo-seq signals of protein-
coding Alu exons (22 % vs. 13 %), although the statis-
tical significance was marginal
(P = 0.056, one-sided
Fisher’s exact test), probably due to the small sample
size and possibly the effect of the pioneering round
of
translation in NMD transcripts [31]. These data
suggest that Ribo-seq provides a discriminative feature
of protein-coding Alu exons but cannot be used alone
as their sole evidence.

inclusion levels of at

As the most central and direct evidence for protein-
coding Alu exons in this work came from the analysis of
PRIDE peptide data, we used multiple negative controls to
assess the reliability of our PRIDE search. First, we used
mouse peptides as a negative control and searched mouse
peptides in PRIDE and in our own COPaKB database of
cardiac proteins [32] against human Alu exons. We did not
find any mouse peptide hit of longer than four amino acids
in either database, which was below the length cutoff we
required for human PRIDE peptide hits (≥6 amino acids).
Second, we used putative NMD-inducing Alu exons in
protein-coding genes as another negative control to assess
the FDR of our PRIDE analysis using human peptide data.
Specifically, we performed PRIDE search on all NMD-
inducing Alu exons and identified PRIDE hits for 47 out of
649 exons (7.2 %). This percentage is significantly lower
than that of the putative protein-coding Alu exons (32.4 %,
85 out of 262; P = 1.8e-20, Fisher’s exact test). Even if we
take a very conservative estimate that all of these 649
NMD-inducing exons represent true negatives and none of
them can be protein-coding via mRNA isoforms with alter-
native reading frames or A-to-I editing of the STOP codon
(a possible scenario supported by the literature; see [33]),
we would estimate that 19 of the 262 putative protein-
coding Alu exons would generate false positive PRIDE hits
(that is, 262 × 7.2 %), yielding a low upper-bound estimate
of FDR of 22 % (that is, 19 out of 85). In summary, using
putative NMD-inducing Alu exons as our negative control,
we demonstrate that the FDR of our PRIDE search is low,
and that the vast majority of the 85 PRIDE hits reflect bona
fide proteomic evidence for protein-coding Alu exons.

Human-specific increase in the splicing activity of a
protein-coding Alu exon in SUGT1
We studied an Alu exon derived peptide in SUGT1,
which was supported by multiple lines of evidence from

proteomics (PRIDE and PeptideAtlas) and Ribo-seq data
(Fig. 3a-c). SUGT1 is an assembly factor for the kineto-
chore and is required for the G1/S and G2/M transitions
[34]. The Alu exon encodes a peptide of 33 amino acids
inserted at the end of the third tetratricopeptide repeat
(TPR) in the SUGT1 protein product. We identified five
peptide sequences in PRIDE that matched to the up-
stream or downstream splice junction of this Alu exon,
and additional peptide evidence was found in the highly
stringent PeptideAtlas (Fig. 3a). This exon had a sig-
nificant splicing activity in HeLa cells with a tran-
script inclusion level of 49 % according to RNA-seq
data, while its transcript inclusion level
in the Ribo-
seq data was even higher (66 %; see Figs. 2a and 3c),
suggesting active translation of the Alu exon inclusion
mRNA isoform. Given the strong evidence for this
Alu exon derived peptide, we next asked whether the
expression of this Alu exon inclusion protein isoform
has been detected in previous studies. A literature
search showed that the SUGT1 protein isoform con-
taining the 33 amino acids encoded by exon 6 (that

exon 6 was derived from a primate specific Alu retro-
transposon [34–36].

The recent origin of Alu elements suggests that the
Alu exon derived peptide in SUGT1 could contribute to
the evolutionary divergence of the human and non-
human primate protein products. To investigate the evo-
lution of this Alu exon further, we designed RT-PCR
primers for its flanking constitutive exons in human,
chimpanzee, and rhesus macaque genomes and quanti-
fied the exon splicing levels in four tissues (brain, kid-
ney, liver, and muscle) (Fig. 3d; also see Additional file 5:
Figure S2 for the fluorescently labeled RT-PCR gel im-
ages). Our RT-PCR analyses showed this exon had the
highest levels of splicing (12–35 %) in human tissues. By
contrast, the orthologous exon region was completely
absent from the rhesus macaque transcripts. Chimpan-
zee transcripts showed intermediate transcript inclusion
levels (0–24 %).

Next we aligned the human, chimpanzee, and rhesus
genomic sequences with the consensus sequence of the
corresponding Alu subfamily (AluSx) (Additional file 5:
Figure S3). The resulting alignment suggested that this
Alu exonization event occurred prior to the most recent
common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees. Specific-
ally, a C to T substitution created the 5’ splice site GT
dinucleotide, which, when combined with the pre-
existing 3’ splice site AG dinucleotide in AluSx, led to
Alu exonization. Additionally, a G to A substitution at
the +3 intronic position of the 5’ splice site strengthened
the splice site score from 5.29 to 9.46 as calculated by
MAXENT [37], representing an over 16-fold increase in
the likelihood of matching to the consensus MAXENT

5’ splice site model. The rhesus sequence lacked the es-
sential GT dinucleotide at the 5’ splice site, consistent
with the observation that
the exon was completely
skipped in rhesus transcripts. We did not observe any
nucleotide difference between the human and chimpan-
zee sequences within the exon or the 5’ and 3’ splice site
regions (Additional file 5: Figure S3). However, beyond
the splice sites there were a number of nucleotide differ-
ences in the upstream and the downstream intronic re-
gions, which may be responsible for the difference in
splicing levels between the human and chimpanzee
exons.

We carried out a comprehensive investigation of
the genomic sequence changes that strengthened the
SUGT1 Alu exon in the human lineage (Fig. 4). There
was no obvious candidate for causal cis sequence
change(s) based on sequence analysis of splicing regula-
tory elements. Between human and chimpanzee, no se-
quence divergence was found within the Alu exon or in
the 9 bp 5’ splice site and 23 bp 3’ splice site regions.

differences between human and chimpanzee are indicated by

for fluorescently labeled RT-PCR analyses in Hela cells using the
SUGT1 Alu exon wild-type and mutant minigene constructs

Therefore, the causal cis sequence change(s) must reside
in the upstream or downstream intronic region further
away from the splice sites. These intronic regions con-
tained a fairly large number of sequence changes between
human and chimpanzee. We cloned a large genomic frag-
ment surrounding the SUGT1 Alu exon into a minigene
splicing reporter (see Materials and Methods) and gener-
ated three splicing reporter constructs corresponding to
the wild-type human, chimpanzee, and rhesus genomic se-
quence (Hs-WT, Pt-WT, and Rm-WT; see Fig. 4a). When
expressed in Hela cells, the chimpanzee minigene con-
struct had an exon inclusion level of 50 ± 7 %, while the
human minigene construct had a higher exon inclusion
level of 70 ± 3 %, and no exon inclusion was observed for
the rhesus minigene construct. The splicing difference be-
tween the human and chimpanzee wild-type minigene
constructs was consistent with the difference of en-
dogenous splicing levels in human and chimpanzee tis-
sues (12–35 % vs. 0–24 %). The overall higher baseline
exon inclusion levels in the minigene constructs may indi-
cate deeper intronic splicing silencers that were not
cloned into the minigene reporter, but this should not
affect our human vs chimpanzee comparative analysis.
Then we used a sequence swapping strategy [38] to make
six additional splicing reporter constructs in which gen-
omic segments from different species were swapped in
order to narrow down the genomic region responsible for
the human-specific splicing pattern (Fig. 4a). The analysis
of these minigene splicing reporters indicates that a prox-
imal 430 bp upstream intronic region is responsible for
the human-specific increase in splicing compared to
chimpanzee. All minigene constructs containing the chim-
panzee version of this 430 bp intronic region showed ap-
proximately 50 % exon inclusion, while all minigene
constructs containing the human version of this region
showed close to 70 % exon inclusion, despite being placed
within different surrounding sequence context (Fig. 4a, b).
We obtained similar results when transfecting these re-
porters to a chimpanzee fibroblast cell
line (data not
shown), further supporting our hypothesis that the spli-
cing divergence of this SUGT1 Alu exon was driven by cis
sequence changes. Within this 430 bp upstream intronic
region, there were six individual nucleotide substitutions
between human and chimpanzee. We were unable to suc-
cessfully perform further point mutation analyses of this
region, due to the sequence homology between this region
(which was AluSx derived) with an adjacent upstream
AluJb element (see Fig. 4a). Nonetheless, our minigene
splicing reporter data have established the role of specific
cis genomic sequences in shaping the evolution of this Alu
exon in the human lineage.

Collectively, our data indicate a gradually strengthened
splicing activity of the SUGT1 Alu exon during recent
primate and human evolution. It is possible that the

acquisition and increased expression of this Alu-derived
peptide in human tissues have certain adaptive benefits
and are driven by positive selection.

The Alu exon inclusion isoform of ADARB1 encodes an
active RNA editing enzyme with an altered editing activity
To investigate whether Alu-derived peptides can be
part of functional proteins, we selected a protein cod-
ing Alu exon in the RNA editing enzyme ADARB1
(ENSG00000197381, also known as ADAR2) for de-
tailed studies. The crystal structure of the catalytic
domain of human ADARB1 has been solved [39]. The
Alu exon encodes a 40 amino acid peptide inserted
into the catalytic deaminase domain, which is sup-
ported by two peptide sequences in PRIDE (Fig. 5a).
This exon displayed moderate to high levels of spli-
cing (25–100 %) across human tissues according to
the RNA-seq data,
including eight out of 19 tissues
with over 75 % exon inclusion levels. Our RT-PCR
analyses of human, chimpanzee, and rhesus tissues
showed that
the Alu exon was consistently spliced
into transcripts with comparable splicing levels in all
three species, while there was variation in its splicing

levels across different tissues and individuals (Additional
file 5: Figure S4). In previous in vitro studies where puri-
fied recombinant ADARB1 protein isoforms were incu-
bated with an artificial dsRNA substrate, the Alu exon
inclusion protein isoform showed a lower catalytic activity
than the Alu exon skipping isoform [19, 40]. However, the
functional activity of the Alu exon inclusion ADARB1
protein isoform on endogenous mRNA transcripts has
not been examined on a genome-scale in a live cell
setting.

To test the effect of the ADARB1 protein isoforms on
RNA editing, we selected the HEK293 cell line which
had a low endogenous ADARB1 level, and ectopically
expressed either the Alu exon inclusion or skipping
ADARB1 protein isoform. Real-time qRT-PCR and west-
ern blot analyses indicated that both isoforms were
expressed at similar levels (Additional file 5: Figure S5).
To characterize the transcriptome-wide effect on RNA
editing, we then performed strand-specific RNA-seq of
cells transfected with one of the two ADARB1 protein
isoforms or an empty vector control
(Materials and
Methods). We collected annotated A-to-I editing sites in
human genes from the RADAR database of RNA editing

sites [41], and restricted our analysis to a set of 7,618
sites with sufficient sequencing coverage in our data set
(Materials and Methods). We then compared the overall
RNA editing levels in the cells across different experi-
mental conditions. Both the Alu exon inclusion and
skipping protein isoforms significantly enhanced the
overall editing levels in the HEK293 cells as compared
to the empty vector control (Wilcoxon test, Short vs.
EV: P = 6.5e-68, Long vs. EV: P = 2.1e-50; Fig. 5b), indi-
cating the Alu exon inclusion protein isoform is an ac-
tive RNA editing enzyme with a global impact on RNA
editing. We also noted that the overall RNA editing level
was lower in cells expressing the Alu exon inclusion iso-
form as compared to cells expressing the Alu exon
skipping isoform (Wilcoxon test, P = 4.7e-10; Fig. 5b),
consistent with the in vitro assay results on the synthetic
RNA editing substrate [19, 40].

To investigate potential differences in the site selectiv-
ity of these two ADARB1 isoforms, we sought to identify
differentially edited sites upon ectopic expression of the
Alu exon inclusion (long) or skipping (short) isoform.
Specifically, for each annotated RNA editing site in the
RADAR database [41], we counted and compared their
edited and unedited RNA-seq reads with those of the
empty vector (EV) transfected cells. For each individual
replicate, we used Fisher’s exact test to calculate the P
value, then combined the P values of three replicates
using Fisher’s method to generate a combined P value
for differential editing, followed by correction of multiple
testing to generate FDR. The editing sites with FDR ≤ 10 %
were called differential RNA editing sites. We then com-
pared the identified differential RNA editing sites for the
Alu exon inclusion (long) or skipping (short) ADARB1
isoform to identify common and isoform-specific differen-
tial RNA editing sites. To guard against potential spurious
calls of isoform-specific differential editing sites due to
RNA-seq noise and statistical fluctuation, we also gener-
ated a high-confidence list of isoform-specific differential
RNA editing sites, defined as those with FDR ≤ 10 % for
one isoform and FDR ≥ 90 % for the other isoform. We
identified a total of 360 differential RNA editing sites in
the RNA-seq data after ectopic expression of one of the
two isoforms (Fig. 5c). As seen in Fig. 5c, most of them
were either common to the two isoforms, or were clas-
sified as isoform-specific but the difference between the
two isoforms was minor and could be attributed to ran-
dom RNA-seq noise and statistical fluctuation (that is,
those classified as ‘low-confidence’
isoform specific
sites). We did identify six high-confidence long isoform
specific and 14 high-confidence short isoform specific
differential RNA editing sites, but they represented a
fairly small percentage of all identified differential RNA
editing sites (Fig. 5c). It is interesting to note that in
general, we identified almost
twice as many short

isoform specific sites than long isoform specific sites, at
various confidence level cutoffs (Fig. 5c). Collectively,
these data suggest that regulated alternative splicing of
this Alu exon may fine tune the editing activities and in
limited cases the target site selectivity of the ADARB1
protein products.

Discussion
The creation and establishment of new exons provide an
important evolutionary strategy for generating genetic
novelties in existing genes [42, 43]. A large body of work
has investigated the exonization of Alu elements as a
major source for new exons during primate and human
evolution [5, 7–9, 44–47]. Recent studies have shown
that a subset of Alu exons in human genes have acquired
strong splicing activities [8, 9], and that they play a var-
iety of regulatory roles at the RNA level such as the con-
trol of mRNA degradation and translation [8–10]. On
the other hand, the contribution of Alu exonization to
the human proteome has been considered to be minimal
[13]. In 2006, a survey of protein sequence entries in the
PDB did not identify any peptide segment derived from
Alu or other young transposable elements (TEs), leading
the authors to conclude that ‘functional proteins are
unlikely to contain TE cassettes derived from young
TEs, the role of which is probably limited to regulatory
functions’ [13].

In this work, we revisited the role of Alu exonization
in human proteome evolution and adopted a proteotran-
scriptomics approach [48] to systematically evaluate the
evidence for Alu exon derived peptides in human pro-
teins. We identified 262 putative coding Alu exons in
Ensembl human transcripts, among which 85 exons had
proteomic evidence in the PRIDE peptide database.
Using multiple negative controls, we demonstrated that
our proteomic identification of protein-coding Alu exons
based on the PRIDE search had a low FDR. We also
performed detailed analyses of RNA-seq and Ribo-seq
data of human tissues and cell lines to provide more
fine-grained information on the splicing and transla-
tional profiles of
these protein-coding Alu exons.
Using RNA-seq data of 19 human tissues, we identi-
fied 52 protein-coding Alu exons with high transcript
inclusion levels and/or tissue-specific splicing profiles,
significantly expanding the catalog of coding-region
Alu exons with strong splicing activities in normal
human tissues, which were considered rare in previ-
ous work [8, 9]. Collectively, our data challenge the
conventional view on the proteomic impact of Alu
exonization and suggest that an appreciable number
of coding-region Alu exons are translated into stable
protein products. Therefore, the contribution of Alu
exons to the human proteome is significantly higher
than previously suggested [13].

We studied a protein coding Alu exon in SUGT1, a
gene encoding a cell cycle regulator [34]. The translation
of this SUGT1 Alu exon is supported by multiple lines
of evidence (Ribo-seq, PRIDE, PeptideAtlas) as well as
previous literature [34–36]. Although the specific func-
tion of this SUGT1 Alu exon inclusion isoform remains
to be elucidated, existing data suggest that the splicing
of this Alu exon is under dynamic regulation in human
cells. SUGT1 is reported to be a member of the pro-
inflammatory complex ‘inflammasome’ and its protein
level, especially the level of the Alu exon inclusion iso-
form (known as ‘SUGT1B’ in the literature), increases
after heat shock [49]. SUGT1B also appears to be prefer-
entially translocated to and accumulate in the nucleus
under heat shock [50]. Additionally, there is anecdotal
evidence showing SUGT1B is expressed at a much
higher level than SUGT1A (that is, the Alu exon skip-
ping isoform) in a human malignant glioblastoma cell
line U-251 MG [51], as compared to the near or lower
than 1:1 ratio in liver and tonsil tissues tested in the
same experiment as well as various tissues and cell lines
analyzed in other reports [34–36, 49]. Interestingly, our
RT-PCR analyses indicate a significant gradient in the
splicing levels of this SUGT1 Alu exon between human,
chimpanzee, and rhesus macaque tissues, with the exon
spliced at the highest levels in human tissues and com-
pletely skipped in rhesus macaque tissues (Fig. 3d).
Therefore, this Alu exonization event has contributed to
the acquisition and increased expression of a novel pep-
tide segment during very recent human evolution. Of
note, using a moderate-coverage six-tissue RNA-seq
dataset of human, chimpanzee, and rhesus macaque
[52], we identified two additional protein-coding Alu
exons in SRP9 and ZNF468 (see Additional file 1: Table
S1 for their annotations) with more than 15 % increase
in splicing levels in at least one human tissue compared
to the corresponding chimpanzee and rhesus tissue.
Given the limited RNA-seq depth of this dataset, this list
is expected to be quite incomplete.

Conclusions
Our study has revealed a large list of Alu exons that
may be translated and incorporated into primate-
specific or even human-specific protein isoforms.
These Alu exons are created in genes involved in a
wide range of biological functions and molecular pro-
cesses (Table 1). We selected an Alu exon in a tran-
scriptome regulator ADARB1 and performed RNA-seq
experiments to read out the activity of the Alu exon
inclusion protein isoform on transcriptome-wide con-
trol of A-to-I RNA editing. For other protein-coding
Alu exons identified in this work, future experiments
tailored towards their genes’ specific cellular functions
are needed to elucidate the evolutionary significance

the novel protein isoforms

of
exonization.

Materials and methods
RNA-seq analysis of putative coding Alu exons
The locations of Alu elements in the human genome
(hg19) were downloaded from the UCSC Genome
Browser database [53]. The locations of internal cassette
or constitutive exons were taken from Ensembl gene
annotations (release 57) [54]. We defined an exon as
Alu-derived if the Alu element covered at least 25 bp of
the exon and more than 50 % of the total exon length.

We downloaded the Human Body Map 2.0 (HBM2.0)
paired-end RNA-seq data from Gene Expression Omnibus
(GEO) (accession number GSE30611). HBM2.0 RNA-seq
data have a read length of 50 bp. They cover 16 tissues:
adipose, adrenal, brain, breast, colon, heart, kidney, liver,
lung, lymph node, ovary, prostate, skeletal muscle, testes,
thyroid, and white blood cells. We also used paired-end
RNA-seq data of three anatomical compartments of the
human placenta (amnion, chorion, and decidua) generated
in our previous work [55]. We used only 50 bp of each
end for mapping and analysis based on the sequencing
error profile. We used the same RNA-seq mapping
method as previously described [55] to obtain the splice
junction read counts and calculate each exon’s tran-
script inclusion level. We used MATS to identify dif-
ferential alternative splicing events in pairwise tissue
comparisons [24].

Search of the PRIDE database
We searched the PRIDE (PRoteomics IDEntifications)
database [25] for peptide evidence for putative coding
Alu exons. We downloaded the peptide sequences in
June 2014 with more than 1.5 million unique peptide
sequences in PRIDE. Of these 1.5 million peptide se-
quences, approximately 900,000 were uniquely mappable
to the coding regions of the human Ensembl transcripts
(release 57). With these uniquely mappable peptide se-
quences, we examined the ORFs (open reading frames)
containing putative coding Alu exons and identified 85
Alu exons with PRIDE peptide evidence.

Ribo-seq analysis of putative coding Alu exons
Ribo-seq data and corresponding RNA-seq data of HeLa
cells were downloaded from [29]. The sequencing reads
are 36 bp in length. We used the first 30 bp of each read
for mapping and analysis. Reads were mapped to all
splice junctions in human genes (Ensembl genes, release
57). Each splice junction is 54 bp in length, containing
the last 27 bp of the upstream exon and the first 27 bp
of the downstream exon. We used Bowtie [56] to map
reads, allowing up to two mismatches and also required
that each read should be uniquely mapped. Exons’

Construction of ADARB1 isoform expression vectors
The ORF for
isoform
(without the Alu exon) in the pCMV6-AC vector was
purchased from OriGene, Inc. (catalog no. SC321955;
reference transcript NM_001112). Mutageneses using
the QuikChange method (Stratagene) were carried out to
convert the ORF to encode the ADARB1 reference protein
sequence NP_001103. Six nucleotides in pCMV6-AC en-
coding two additional amino acids at the C-terminus were
removed. A minor allele SNP (rs199697177) ‘C’ (allele
frequency <1 %) was mutated back to the major allele
‘T’
in the ADARB1 ORF. Then the Alu exon was
inserted using the same mutagenesis method. Final
pCMV6-ADARB1-short
the Alu exon) and
pCMV6-ADARB1-long (with the Alu exon) constructs
were confirmed by sequencing.

Ectopic expression of ADARB1 isoforms in HEK293 cells
HEK293 cell line was grown in DMEM with 10 % FBS.
Cells were transiently transfected with Lipofectamine
2000 reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were collected
for RNA extraction using TRIzol reagent (Life Tech-
nologies) and protein lysates with RIPA buffer. Trans-
fection experiments were replicated in three different
cell passages.

Total RNA samples were treated with DNaseI
(Fermentas) and reverse transcribed using the High-
Capacity cDNA RT kit (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative
real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using Fast SYBR
green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Total gene ex-
pression level and isoform-specific expression level of
ADARB1 were measured using GAPDH as the reference
gene. Relative expression level was measured by the com-
parative Ct (2-ΔΔCt) method [57]. Primers used are:

GAPDH_F:

5′-TGGTATCGTGGAAGGACTCA-3′,
GAPDH_R: 5′-ACAGTCTTCTGGGTGGCAGT-3′, AD
ARB1_Gene_F:

ADARB1_Gene_R: 5′-GTTGTCCAGATTGCGGTTTT-3′,

ADARB1_short_R: 5′-TGTCTATCTGCTGGTTCTTC-3′,
ADARB1_long_F: 5′-CTCAACCTTCCAAGGAGCTG-3′,
ADARB1_long_R: 5′-GTCCGTAGCTGTCCTCTTGC-3′.
Total protein extract in RIPA buffer was used to
assay for protein level. ADARB1 (sc-10012, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) and ACTB (A5441, Sigma) anti-
bodies were used for western blot following standard
protocol. Signals were detected by ChemiDoc™ MP
imaging system (Bio-Rad). RNA-seq libraries were
prepared using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample
Prep Kit
(Illumina) and sequenced on an Illumina

HiSeq 2000 (100 cycles, paired-end). RNA-seq data
were deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus
database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) under the
accession number GSE65999.

RNA-seq analysis of A-to-I editing
Strand-specific paired-end RNA-seq reads were first
mapped to Ensembl transcripts and the unmapped reads
were then mapped to the human genome (hg19) using
Tophat (version 1.4.1) [58]. We used REDItools [59] to
calculate the edited and unedited read counts on the
corresponding strand of each known RNA editing site
collected in the RADAR database [41]. We removed the
editing sites that had less than five edited counts in all
the nine RNA-seq libraries to avoid using unreliable
editing sites or sites not edited in the samples of interest.
The sites that had no read coverage (edited counts and
unedited counts) for all three replicates of either empty
vector (EV), ADARB1 long form, or ADARB1 short
form transfected cells were also removed from further
analyses because they were uninformative for compari-
sons. In the end, 7,618 known editing sites were used in
the analyses.

To compare the global editing levels between the three
sample groups, we merged the RNA-seq reads of three
replicates in each group, and the editing levels of each
editing site were calculated as the fraction of edited
counts over the total counts in the merged data. To
avoid using sites with unreliable editing levels due to
low read coverage, we used only the editing sites that
had total read coverage ≥50. Then we calculated the sig-
nificance for the editing level differences between two
groups using two-tailed Wilcoxon test.

Total RNA preparation
Postmortem tissue samples of three adult chimpanzees
and three adult rhesus macaques were generously pro-
vided by the Southwest National Primate Research Center
(San Antonio, TX, USA). Total RNAs were extracted
using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNAs from vari-
ous human tissues were purchased from Clontech (Moun-
tain View, CA, USA), BioChain (Newark, CA, USA), and
Ambion (now part of Thermo Fisher, Grand Island, NY,
USA), or prepared as previously described [55].

Fluorescently labeled RT-PCR analysis of exon splicing
Single-pass cDNA was synthesized using the High-
Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit
(Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) according to
manufacturer's instructions. Two micrograms of total
RNA were used for each 20 μL cDNA synthesis re-
action. Fluorescently labeled RT-PCR was carried out
as described previously [60]. PCR primer sequences

are listed in Additional file 4: Table S4. Each gel picture
shown was a representation of at least three replicates.

Minigene analysis of SUGT1 protein-coding Alu exon splicing
Alu exon (Exon 6) of SUGT1 and its adjacent flanking
intronic regions were amplified from the human, chim-
panzee and rhesus genomic DNAs using KAPA HiFi
HotStart ReadyMix PCR Kit
(Kapa Biosystems, Inc.,
Wilmington, MA, USA). PCR products were subcloned
into the NotI site of the pI-11-H3 minigene vector [61]
(kindly provided by Dr. Russ P. Carstens, University of
Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA) using the In-Fusion
Advantage PCR Cloning Kit (Clontech, Mountain View,
CA, USA). Sequence swapping mutagenesis [38] was done
using KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix PCR Kit. All se-
quences and mutations were verified by DNA sequencing.

In vitro minigene splicing reporter assay
HeLa cells and chimpanzee fibroblast cells (S008861,
Coriell
Institute, Camden, NJ, USA) were grown in
DMEM (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher, Grand Island, NY,
USA) with 10 % FBS (Invitrogen). Cells were plated in
12-well plates and transfected using Lipofectamine LTX
and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), respectively, ac-
cording to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA was puri-
fied 16 h after transfection and reverse-transcribed into
single-pass cDNA. Fluorescently labeled RT–PCR was
performed as described above. The pI-11-H3 minigene-
