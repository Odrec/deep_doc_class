L’Oréal Garnier China 

Andrew Hill On management FT 14.01.2014 

When L’Oréal said last week it would stop selling Garnier products in China, many outsiders 

assumed the French cosmetics group was joining a wholesale retreat by big western brands, 

led by Revlon of the US, which last month closed all its operations in mainland China, 

eliminating 1,100 jobs, including those of 940 beauty advisers. It all looked pretty ugly.  

But the Garnier story has as many wrinkles as a Middle Kingdom matron before using its 

“skin brightener” PS Cream 5s. Beneath the make-up lies a more complex picture of how (and 

how not) to sell big consumer brands into rapidly evolving markets.  

Lesson one: choose your category carefully. China’s demanding consumers redraw the lines 

between luxury, premium, affordable and mass market products virtually weekly. As Gucci 

and Louis Vuitton know to their cost, it is hard to balance expansion and exclusivity.  

Beauty products ought to be different. Once the foundation is on, or the shampoo applied, 

who, other than the user, knows which pot it came from?  

Not so fast. As Tarek Farahat, Procter & Gamble’s president for Latin America, told a recent 

conference, consumers in the growing emerging market middle class are “not going to buy a 

Porsche or a Ferrari”, but they still want “a visible and tangible upgrade in their daily life”, 

which cosmetics and haircare products can provide.  

These consumers are also acutely aware of the balance between price and value. Since 

launching Garnier in China in 2006, L’Oréal has offered its branded creams and hair 

colourings through supermarkets, while distributing the higher-end L’Oréal Paris range, first 

introduced there in 1997, through department stores. But Garnier still fell between categories. 

Snubbed by Chinese consumers looking for a premium product, its skincare and hair 

colouring products proved too expensive for those seeking a cheaper alternative.
