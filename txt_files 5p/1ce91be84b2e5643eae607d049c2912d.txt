Strategies for Syntactic Proofs

When constructing an optimal DNF/CNF, there are a lot of
possible approaches:

substitution

the truth table method and distribution

Karnaugh maps

Choose the one that seems appropriate in the situation/that you
are most comfortable with.

Sometimes checking for tautologies (1.2), contradictions (2.3),
already optimal formulas (1.3) or formulas you already know
(2.1) may also be very helpful.

3.3

The set {¬,∧,→} is a complete system.

True. {¬,∧} is a complete system, and adding another connective
to the set cannot make it less expressive. Therefore, {¬,∧,→} is
still a complete system.

There are two types of assumptions:

1 assumptions from your set of premises
2 other, auxiliary assumptions, marked with an * in the set of

assumptions

Auxiliary assumptions must be discharged in your conclusion,
otherwise you did not prove anything. You can do this with the
help of ( ∨E ,) →I and RAA.

already have a disjunction. The following rules can be used to

eliminate auxiliary assumptions in any situation.

Φ Theorems

Strategies for Syntactic Proofs

A theorem in GLCS is a Lprop sentence Φ
that can be derived from the empty set:

(cid:96)GLCS Φ

When deriving a theorem:

1 start by making one or multiple auxiliary assumptions

2 your overall goal is to get rid of these assumptions with

→I or RAA

3 rule of thumb: if the conclusion's main operator is a

conditional, use →I , else use RAA

1 start by assuming all of premises

2 construct derivations from back to front: identify the main

connective, and focus on rules for constructing sentences with
that kind of connective

3 identify the premises that contain the sentence to be derived,

and focus on rules for extracting this sentence
