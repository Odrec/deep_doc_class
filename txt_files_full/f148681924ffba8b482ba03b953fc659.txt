Revenge is the infliction of harm in return for perceived wrong. It is 
frequently  cited as  a motivating  factor in  human  aggression.  Vengeful 
aggression has been implicated in a wide variety of illegal and antisocial 
acts  including  arson  (0' Sullivan  &  Kelleher,  1987),  rape  (ScuUy  & 
Marolla,  1985),  assault  (Ney,  1987),  vandalism  (WiesenthaI,  1990), 
homicide (porporino, Doherty & Sawatsky, 1987), shoplifting (Turner & 
Cashdon, 1988), and employee theft{Terris & Jones, 1982). Despite this, 
there is little psychological research on vengeance per se. Moreover, there 
presently  is  no  se ale  in  the  literature  to  measure  attitudes .toward  the

appropriateness of taking  vengeful  action.  Tbe  purpose of the  present 
research was to develop such a scale. 

Tbe perspective on revenge in the psychologicalliterature centers on 
revenge as a motivating factor in human aggressions rather than on the 
concept of revenge itself. Tbe terms revenge and vengeance are not even 
designated as keywords in the American Psychological Abstracts, but are 
subsumed under the classification of reciprocity. Responses to harmful 
acts are typically considered in the context of tit for tat reciprocity or as 
retaliation (Axe~ 1984). However, revenge differs conceptually from 
both reciprocity and retaliation  in  several key respects.  lbe following 
examination of the concept of vengeance seeks to provide the defming 
characteristics of revenge and to indicate the ditlerences between revenge, 
retaliation, hostility, reciprocity, and retribution. 

Tbe vengeful act is essentially personal (Bar-Elli & Heyd, 1986) and 
is usually committed after a period of reflecting on harm done to oneself. 
Buss (1961) indicates that revenge is typica1ly an intense form of aggres(cid:173)
sion  that  results  when  the  avenger  has  bad  a  chance  to  "mull  over 
rejections, attacks and disappointments" (p.1S). In contrast, "retaliation" 
can  be  seen  as  having  the  primary  pwpose of deterrence.  It does not 
necessarily involve affect and it is basically rational in its intent. It is often 
immediate (the quickness of response being useful to convey the contin(cid:173)
gency to the original harmdoer). "Revenge," on the other band, has the 
essential purpose of giving the avenger relief from a feeling of discomfort 
(often anger). It is not necessarily rational. Although it may incidentally 
deter future aggression, often this is not the case since the avenger may act 
anonymously, or the vengeful act itself may provoke further aggressive 
reaction. 

Acts  of retribution düfer from  acts of vengeance  in that they  are 
sanctioned by the state (Oldenquist, 1988), and in that they are limited in 
theirintensity (Henberg, 1990). In general, vengefulresponses are typically 
of greaterintensity than their provocation (Marongiu & Newman, 1987). 
Tbere are also clear indications of anger inherent in vengeful aggressive 
responses  (Buss,  1961).  Revenge  düfers  from  general hostility (Buss, 
1961) in that the justification and motivation for vengeful aggressive acts 
rests  on  the  perception  of  having  being  wronged,  rather  than 
undifferentiated feelings of hostility toward others. 

While there often is disapproval ofthose who seekrevenge, vengeance 
is neither universa1ly condemned nor condoned (Daly & Wilson,  1988; 
Jacoby, 1986). Fromm (1983) argues that vengeance is a malignant, but 
typically human behaviour, and that it differs from the notmal defensive 
aggression  common  in  most  species.  Marongiu  and  Newman  (1987)

reaction, but disagree with bis contention that vengeance iS an abnormal 
response that is  always both cold-blooded and vicious. They note that 
there are some societies where there is a moral duty to seele revenge and 
noncompliance with this norm results in ostracization. 

Contrary to the placement of vengeance under the rubric of reciproc(cid:173)

ity in the Psychological Abstracts, revenge is not simply the negative pole 
in  a  continuum  of reciprocity  where  positive  responses  are  made  to 
positive sets, and negative responses are made to negati ve acts. Rather, an 
act of revenge  is  typically  of greater intensity  than an set of negative 
reciprocity (Axelrod, 1984). 

In summary, these considerations suggest a concept of revenge that 
rests on the perception of having being wronged, rather than some other 
motivation such as hostility. These vengefulresponses are typically more 
extreme  than  would  be  indicated  by  the  norm  of reciprocity.  While 
vengefulness  is  distinct from  generalized  hostility,  a  highly  vengeful 
person is particularly likely to exhibit anger. 

A search of the litemture in psychology and related disciplines (e.g., 
sociology,  education,  and psychiatry)  as  well  as  test catalogues  (e,.g., 
Buros,  1970,  1974,  1978;  Keyser &  Sweetland,  1988; Mitchell,  1985; 
Robinson & Shaver, 1973; Robinson, Shaver & ~rightsman, 1991) did 
not  yield  any  scales  devoted  to  the  measurement of attitudes  toward 
taking  revenge.  This  search  did locate  three  measures  that mentioned 
revenge,  but  none  was  an  independent  measure  ofattitudes  towards 
revenge. 

The  Sustaining  Fantasy  Questionnaire  (Zelin,  Bernstein,  Heijn, 
Jampel, Myerson, Adler, Buie, & Rizzuto, 1983) was designed to measure 
the sustaining functions of fantasies in psychiatrie inpatients. The Power 
and Revenge  subscale  is  not  primarily  a  measure  of attitudes  toward 
vengefulness but, instead, includes items reflecting ~'ways of countering 
feelings of intolerable victimization by being in a powerful position trom 
which  one can  impose  well-deserved hurt to  hated objects"  (p.  429). 
Examples of these items are "The thoughts of people obeying me because 
of the powerful position I have reached", "Getting back at people who 
hurt me", and ''The thought of earning a lot of money." 

Similarly, the revenge subscale in a study by Rotherham and Marston 
(1982)  was  designed  to  examiIie  the  construct validity  of verbal  and 
physical  aggressiveness  among  incarcerated delinquents,  and was  not 
intended to measure attitudes  toward  the appropriateness of taking re(cid:173)
venge.  The  subscale,  a  2S.:item  hypothetical  behaviour  measure,  the 
Revenge scale,  was  designed to  assess the degree of injury that woul<! 
makethe subjects feel satisfied.

JOURNAL OF SOCIAL BERA VIOR AND PERSONAllTY 

The Revenge subscale in the Miller Motivation Sca1e (Miller, 1985) 
is  made  up  of a  group  of essentiaUy  negative  social  motives.  These 
motives include feelings of revenge, but also those of selfishness, adesire 
to keep others at a distance, and the perceived need to guard one' s self and 
possessions against invasion. 

The results of this search appear to confirm the lack of a free-standing 
rneasure of attitudes toward revenge. The present research was designed 
to provide such a measure using scale development procedures suggested 
by  Aiken  (1989),  Jackson  (1970),  and  Walsh  and  Betz  (1985).  The 
research  strategy  for  the  development of a scale  to  measure  attitudes 
towardrevenge involved three separate studies. Study 1 proceeded through 
the three phases of item generation, item refinement, and item selection to 
produce a measure of attitudes toward revenge. An initial examination of 
validity was also conducted in this first study. Study 2 was designed to 
assess the reliabillty and validity of the scale. Study 3 assessed the test(cid:173)
retest reliability of the Vengeance Scale. 

The expectations for  this research were,  fnt, that a reliable scale 
would be constructed that would be comprised of diverse items dealing 
with  attitudes  toward  the  appropriateness  of vengeful  responses  to 
perceived wrongs. Second, this scale was expected to exhibit a negative 
relationship to  measures of empathy. since empathy  is  the  tendency  to 
view events from the perspective of others, and to have a warm personal 
concern  for  them (Davis,  1980,  1983). Thus,  high empathy  would  be 
inconsistent with aggression (Cornen, 1985) and the holding of aggressive 
or vengeful attitudes. Third, it was expected there would be a moderate 
positive relationship between the scale measuring attitudes toward revenge 
and  measures  of anger.  Fourth,  consistent with  the  idea  that revenge 
differs  from  general  reciprocity,  it  was  expected  there  would  be  no 
relationship  between  the  scale  and  measures  of positive  reciprocity. 
Finally, it was desired that there would not be a high relationship between 
the scale and measures of social desirability.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE VENGEANCE SCALE 

Item Generation 

As a fIrst step, items were written after consulting various reference 
sources (Barnhart, 1988; Cowie & MacHn, 1983; Lewis, 1978; Longman, 
1986) which indicate that the  terms revenge,  vengeance,  vengefulness 
and vindictive are all closely related to the concept of harmful responses 
to perceived wrong (Simpson &  Weiner,  1988).  Additional items were 
written reflecting aspects of revenge discussed in the literature reviewed 
above. For exarnple, "I try to even the score with anyone who hurts mett

and "Honour requires that you get back at someone who has hurt you" 
were based on the discussion in Marongiu and Newman (1987). 

In addition, eight hostitity items such as "There are certain people 
that I distike so  much  that I am inwardly pleased when  they  get into 
trouble for something they have done" were included in order to test the 
discrimination  between  items  written  to  measure  hostility  and  items 
designed to measure revenge. This procedure resulted in an initial pool of 
85 candidate items, including many items that were reversed to control for 
response style bias. 

Item Refinement 

The initial pool of candidate items was examined to identify ambiguous 
wording, double barreled items, and highly redundant items. As part of 
this exercise, graduate students and faculty read the candidate items with 
instructions  to identify any items  that they found difficult,  ambiguous, 
unclear or troublesome in any way. This scrutiny resulted in nine of the 
items being eliminated and many of the remaining items being reworded. 
The judges were also asked to rate the extent to which the candidate ite~ 
were good revenge items (i.e., that they contained content that addressed 
important aspects of revenge and vengefulness). As a result, six items that 
involved terrorism  (e.g.,  "The only way  to stop  terrorism is  to hit the 
offenders as hard as possible.") were judged to reflect a different concept 
and were removed from the item pool. Similarly five items dealing with 
legal  and  criminal  issues  (e.g.,  "Criminals  don't get  nearly  as  much 
punishment as they deserve.") were judged to assess a different content 
area. The raters also identified the hostility items as assessing a different 
conceptual domain. B Y this procedure, the item pool was reduced to 57. 
This included a large numberof items in which the wording was reversed. 

Item Selection Phase 

The goal of this phase was to select from the remaining 57 items, the 

best 15 to 25 items as suggested by_Burisch (1984). 

Subjects 

A total of 402 undergraduates were drawn from psychology, sociol(cid:173)
ogy, history, mathematics, and business  administration classes at York 
University. This sampie included students enrolled in the Arts Faculty or 
in Atldnson College which serves evening part-time students. The latter 
students tend to be older, more diverse in terms of ethnicity and occupa(cid:173)
tion, and are more likely to be married. This combination of participants 
gave  an  opportunity  to  gain  a  wider sampling  than  would  have  been 
possible by using only full-time day undergraduate psychology students. 
The sampie included 267 females, 121 males, and 14 who did not identify

their gender. The age range was from 18 to 59 years, M = 23, SD ==  6.33, 
and 88% were single. 

Materials 

The 57 items produeed in the initial phases of the item generation and 
refinement were  presented  in  a Likert-type  scale format.  Respondents 
indicated  their  agreement  with  each  statement  on  a seven-point  seale 
ranging from disagree strongly to agree strongly. Additional seales were 
given to provide evidenee regarding the convergent and divergent validity 
ofthe final scale as recommended by Jackson (1970). The 13-item short 
form of the Marlowe-Crowne Scale (Reynolds,  1982),  and the  16-item 
Jaekson Social Desirability Scale (Jackson,  1970) were included to test 
for social desirability eontamination of the candidate items. The partiei(cid:173)
pants completed the Trait Anger Seale (Spielberger, Jacobs, Russell, & 
Crane, 1983) to test the prediction that there would be a moderate positive 
eorrelation between vengefulness and anger. Partieipants also eompleted 
an  Empathy  scale  eornposed  of the  perspective-taking  and  empathie 
concern subseales of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (Davis, 1980). A 
negative eorrelation between vengefulness and this measure of ernpathy 
was  predieted. Finally, partieipants  answered questions regarding  their 
age, gender, marital status, and ethnk origin. 

Procedure 

The questionnaire was presented to the classes as a study on attitudes 
toward revenge  or  vengefulness.  Respondents  were  assured  that  their 
partieipation was  voluntary,  that their responses  were  anonymous,  and 
that they would receive feedback on the results of the research. 

Criteria for Item Selection 

The following statistical analyses were performed to seleet items for 
the  scale.  As  a  first  step,  each  itern  was  examined  to  determine  its 
eontribution to the internal consistency ofthe total scale (all 57 items). An 
item was elirninated if the inclusion of that item resulted in a lowering of 
Cronbaeh's alpha to a Value  of less than  .80 (Walsh  & Betz,  1985). In 
addition,  item-total  correlations  for  each  of the  candidate  items  were 
exarnined. The nllnimum eriterion for selection was .40. Seco~ correla(cid:173)
tions  between  each  of the  eandidate  items  and  the  Marlowe-Crowne 
Social Desirability ScaJe, and the Jaekson Social Desirability Scale were 
examined to test for evidence of social desirability contamination. Items 
were onlyretained if they  had correlations of less  than .30 with social 
desirability. Third, an item was eliminated if its item-total correlation was 
lower than its correlation with any other of the seales (Jackson, 1970).

Results and Discussion 

Item Selection 

Tbe  total of 402 research participants meets  the subjectlitem ratio 
criterion of between  5:1  to  10:1  advocated by  Nunnally (1978).  After 
initial analysis, eight items were eliminated because they failed to meet 
the item-total minimum criteria. Further selection was based on item-total 
correlations and the direction of the item, that is, whether agreement with 
the item indicated approval or disapproval of vengeance. The remaining 
49 items were then ranked on the basis of their item-total correlation. Tbe 
top 20 items were examined for redundancy, clarity, and direction, and 
four  substitutions  were  made  on  this  basis.  The  fmal  20-item  scale, 
hereafter referred to as the Vengeance Scale, contained ten items written 
in the reverse direction, Le., with agreement indicating low vengefulness. 
These items are given in the Appendix. 

Reliabllity 

Analysis performed on the Vengeance Scale resulted in a Cronbach 
alpha of .92. Tbe alpha was .92 for females and .93 for males. The me,an 
inter-item correlation was .38. This is weIl within the range of .20 to AO 
that  Briggs  and  Cheek  (1986)  suggest  is  the  optimal  level  of item 
homogeneity for ascale. These findings suggest that the scale has a high 
level of internal consistency for both males and females,. 

Assessment of Social Desirability ContaminatiOn 

Tbe correlation between the Vengeance Scale and the J ackson Social 
Desirability Sc ale was low, r (341) = -.14, P <.01. The correlation with the 
short version of the Marlowe-Crowne was r (361) = -.24, p< .001. This 
low correlation was  itself inflated by one item on the Marlowe-Crowne 
Scale, "Sometimes I try to get even rather than forgive or forget", which 
is highly similar in content to the Vengeance scale ite'ms. On its own, this 
item  had  a  correlation  of r  (370)  =  -.55,  P  <.001  with  the  20-item 
Vengeance Scale. The range of the magnitudes of the correlations of the 
remaining 12 Marlowe-Crowne items with the Vengeance Scale was .003 
to .20. On these grounds, this item was deleted from the scale, leaving a 
twelve item scale, bereafter referred to as the "reduced Marlowe-Crowne". 
The correlation between the Vengeance Scale and the reduced Marlowe(cid:173)
Crowne Scale was r (361) = -.15, P < .01. The correlation ofthereduced 
Marlowe-Crowne with the Marlowe-Crowne was r (391) = .99, p < .001. 
The reduced Marlowe-Crowne was used in all subsequent analyses. Tbe 
low  negative  correlations  of the  scale  with  these  measures  of social 
desirability indicated that the Vengeance Scale appears to be minimally 
contaminated by social desirability.

Factor Analysis 

A principal components factor analysis stipulating oblique rotation 
was  performed  on  the  Vengeance  Scale.  Three factors  were  extracted 
accounting for 55% of the total variance.  (Varimax rotation essentially 
replicated these results.) The ftrst factor accounted for 42% of the total 
variance of the 20 items. The second factor accounted for 8% of variance 
and reflected the keying of the items. The third factor accounted for 5% of 
variance but was not clearly interpretable. It did not appear to be justifted 
to label these minor factors as  sub-scales.  Application of the  saee test 
(Cattell,  1966)  indicated  that  only  the  first  factor  should be retained. 
Forcing a single factor solution resulted in loadings for each item of .47 or 
above (Check, 1985). These results suggest tbat the Vengeance Scale is 
basically a unidimensional measure. 

Additional Analyses 

The mean for the 20-item Vengeance Scale was 67.28 on a scale of 
o to 140. There was a signiftcant gender difference, t (358) = -2.67, P < 
.001, with a mean for females of 65.29, SD = 19.52, and amean for males 
of 71.84, SD = 21.21. The correlation of the 20-item scale and an ad hoc 
scale made up of the remainder of the candidate items was r (370) = .92, 
p< .001. There was a moderate positive correlation with Trait Anger, 
r (358) = .42, p < .001, in the expected direction. There was, in addition, 
a negative correlation with empathy, r (363) = -.33, p <.001, also in the 
expected direction. 

By way of summary, it can be said that the Vengeance Scale devel(cid:173)
oped in Study 1 appears to be a highly reliable one factor scale, baving 
only low  correlations with measures of social desirability.  In addition, 
there were severaI aspects of this study that argue for the face validity of 
the Vengeance Scale. FIrSt, the items were selected, in part, by judges' 
ratings of the subject material of the items. Second, there was the high 
correlation noted above  between the items  selected for  the Vengeance 
Scale and the ad hoc scale made up of the delete<1 items which also bad 
been  selected for  their content (although  they  did not meet additional 
criteria for inclusion in the fmal scale). Third, examination of the content 
of the items shows quite clearly tbat they deal with revenge.

VALIDATION OF THE VENGEANCE SCALE 

The goal of the second phase of scale development was to provide an 
independent demonstration of the reliability and validity of the Vengeance 
Scale developed in Study 1.

Method 

SubJects 

The subjects were 151 York University day and evening undergradu(cid:173)
ate students similar to those described in Study 1. Tbe age range ofthe 122 
females and 29 males was from 18 to 56 years, M = 27, SD = 8.97 and 
65% were single. 
Materials 

Each research participant completed the following  questionnaires: 
the  Vengeance  Scale  developed  in  Study  1,  the  Trait  Anger  Scale 
(Spielberger et al., 1983), the Empathy Scale (Davis, 1980), and the 13 
item  Marlowe-Crowne  Social Desirability  Scale  (Reynolds,  1982).  In 
addition, a 12-item questionnaire was given to provide concurrent valida(cid:173)
tion for the Vengeance Scale (Stuckless, 1990). This )atter questionnaire 
inclu<ied five hypothetical behavioral items that asked the participants to 
indicate the likelihood of their vengeful responses to hypothetical provo(cid:173)
cations:  unfair  grading  by  a  fellow  student,  a  fellow  employee  who 
deliberately causes you  trouble,  an  unfair act by a professor, someone 
who blocked in your vehicle and a neighbour who inswted you. There was 
also a general question about the number of people YOll would get back at 
if you could. There were,  as  well,  two items asking  the respondents to 
indicate their actual rate of vengeful behaviour in the past few months: 
Your response to being cut off in traffic, and how often you have gone out 
ofyour way to pay people back in the past year. Four additional behavioral 
items  were  also  included  that  asked  the  participants  to  indicate  the 
likelihood of their helpful responses to situations where they received aid 
or favours: send a note of thanks to someone who helped you, the amount 
of effort expended to help someone who bad helped you previously, the 
amount of money you would pay someone who bad lent you money, and 
the amountof time you wouldhelp someone who bad helped you. The last 
four  items fulftlled  a  dual  purpose.  First,  they  allowed discrimination 
between the scale as a measure of voogefulness as opposed to a measure 
of general reciprocity (Le., the tendency to respond to help with help, as 
weIl as to respond to harm with harm). Second, they served as distracter 
items to help disguise the purpose of the validation questionnaire. 
.  Finally, participants answered questions regarding their age, gender, 
marital status, number of children, ethnicity, religious denomination, and 
frequency of attendance at religious services. 

Procedure 

The questionnaire was presented to the classes with instructions that 
differed from the first study only in that the scale was not identified as 
being a measure of revenge or vengefulness.

Results and Discussion 

A total of 151 ofthe 159 questionnaires distributed were usable. This 
meets  the  subjectlitem ratio criterion  of 5:1  to  10:1  recommended  by 
Nunnally (1978). The mean of the 20-item scale was 64.95 on a scale of 
o to 140. There was a significant gender difference, t (149) = -3.52, p < 
.001, with amean forfemales of62.10, SO = 19.75, andamean formales 
of76.90, SO = 22.89. 
ReliabUity 

The Vengeance scale had a Cronbach's alpha of .92. The alpha was 
.90 for females and .93 for males. The sc ale also had an acceptable mean 
inter-item  correlation  of  .36  (Briggs  &  Cheek,  1986).  These  results 
essentially replicate the reliabilities obtained in Study 1, attesting to the 
high reliability of the Vengeance Scale. 

Assessment of Social Desirability Contamination 

The correlation of the Vengeance Scale with the reduced Marlowe(cid:173)
Crowne Social Oesirability Scale was r (145)  = -.23, p < .01. This low 
negative correlation indicates that the Vengeance Scale is only minimally 
contaminated by social desirability. 

Validity 

" 

To assess concurrent validity, correlations were computed between 
the  Vengeance Scale and the individual hypothetical  and  actual  behav(cid:173)
ioral items described above.  Correlations  were also computed between 
the  Vengeance Scale  and  a measure  that was  constructed from  the  six 
hypothetical behavioral items dealing with revenge. Cronbach' s alpha for 
this  six-item behavioral measure was  .79. The correlations of the  Ven(cid:173)
geance Scale with  the individual items  and this behavioral measure are 
shown  in Table  1.  The  large  significant correlation  between  the  Ven(cid:173)
geance  Sc ale  and  the  six-item  behavioral  intention  measure  and  the 
correlations with the two actual behavioral items, indicate a respectable 
level of c6ncurrent validity for the Vengeance Scale. 

A regression analysis was performed to predict subjects' scores on 
the six -item behavioral measure. The purpose of tbis analysis was to show 
that the Vengeance Scale predicts significant unique variance in criterion 
rneasures  that is  not accounted for  by existing, related rneasures.  Trait 
Anger was entered as  the first predictor and accounted for  32% of the 
variance, F = 64.45, P < .001. However, the new measure, the Vengeance 
Scale, also accounted for unique variance, R2 change = .24, F change-
72.69, p <.001 

Convergent  validity  is  demonstrated  by  correlations  with  related 
scales.  There was  a negative correlation between  the Vengeance Scale

general reciprocity. 

Factor Analysis 

A principal components factor analysis stipulating oblique rotation 
was  perfonned on  the  Vengeance  Scale.  Four  factors  were  extracted 
accounting  for  61%  of the  total  variance.  (Varimax  rotation  yielded 
essentially the same results.) The frrst faetor accounted for 40% of the 
total variance of the 20 items. The second factor accounted for 9% of the 
total variance and refleeted keying of the items. The thied faetor aecount-

ing  for  6%  of variance,  and  tbe  fourth  factor  accounting  for  6%  of 
variance were not clearly inteIpl'etable. Agam, retention of these minor 
factors  as  sub-scales did not appear  to be justified.  As  in  Study  1,  an 
application of the scree test indicated tbat only the fmt factor should be 
retained. In addition, all the items loaded at .40 or above when a single 
factor was forced.  These results provide further evidence that tbe Ven(cid:173)
geance Scale is essentially a unidimensional measure. 

STUDY3 : 

TEST -RETEST RELIABILITY 

Tbe purpose of tbis study was to assess the test-retest reliability of tbe 

Vengeance Scale developed in Studies 1 and 2. 

Subjects 

Method 

Tbe  subjects  were  85  York University  psychology  undergraduate 

students who were asked in class to participate in tbis research. 
Materials and Procedure 

On the first occasion, the students were asked to participate by ftlling 
out the Vengeance Scale developed in Studies 1 and 2. To assure anonym(cid:173)
ity, they were asked to formulate two codes and 10 put them on the form 
in order to help match this form with one given on the second occasion. 
Five weeks later, the students were again asked to put both codes on the 
form and to complete the Vengeance Scale along with abrief question(cid:173)
naire on attitudes toward Quebec separation. Tbe latter questionnaire was 
part of another study and was completed following the Vengeance Scale. 
Results 

A  match  using  at  least  one  code  was  necessary  to  include  the 
subject's data in the analysis.  Subject attrition due  to fewer  students in 
attendance  on  the  second  occasion  and matching  failures  reduced  the 
number of pairs of scales to 47. The test-retest correlation was r (47) = .90, 
p<.Ol. 

SUMMARY AND GENERAL DISCUSSION 

Tbe work reported here was directed toward the development of a 
reliable  and  valid  measure  of vengefulness  using  scale  development 
procednres suggested by Aiken (1989), Jackson (1970), and Walsh and 
Betz (1985). Tbe scale that emerged is clearly a highly reliable instrument 
as evidencedby high alpha coefficients and inter-item correlations found 
in both Studies 1 and 2 and the test-retest reliabillty found in Study 3.

The  arguments  foe  the  validity  of the  Vengeance  Scale  draw  on 
findings  from  both Study  1 and Study 2. There are indications of face 
validity:  (1) mere inspection of the items shows that they all deal with 
revenge, (2) the judges' ratings confirm that the selee,ted items are indeed 
"revenge" items, and (3) the high correlation between the selected scale 
and an ad hoc scale constructed of the remaining candidate items, all of 
which bad been written oe chosen to refleet various aspects of attitudes 
toward revenge. 

Evidence  for  concurrent  validity  is  based  on  correlations  of the 
Vengeance Scale with actual reported behaviors,  and the high correla(cid:173)
tions of the Vengeance Scale with self report behavioral items assessing 
the likelihood of vengeful actions. The usefulness of this new measure 
was demonstrated further by the results of the regression analyses which 
found that the Vengeance Scale predicts significant tmique variance that 
is not accounted for by the existing related measure, Trait Anger. 

The  assessment  of construct  validity  was  based  on  correlations 
between the Vengeance Scale and other scales with which it was expected 
to have specific relationships. Although there were no other established 
free-standing measures of vengefulness with which the Vengeance Scale 
could  be  compared,  the  results  confumed  the  expectations  that  the 
Vengeance Scale was positively related to anger and negatively related to 
expressions of empathy. The lack of correlation wi~ measures of helpful 
reciprocity indicated that vengefulness is not simply the negative pole of 
a general tendency toward tit for  tat reciprocity. In addition, there was 
confirmation that the scale was only minimally contaminated by social 
desirability. These considerations support an argument for the construct 
validity of the Vengeance Scale as a measure of attitudes toward personal 
vengeful responses to perceived wrong. 

An additional result of interest is that males had higher Vengeance 
scores than females, even when differences in Trait Anger were taken into 
account. This is consistent with other research reporting that males score 
higher  on  measures  of aggression  (Maccoby  &  Jacklin,  1974,  1980; 
Brigham, 1986). 

One  aspect  of scale  development  that  was  not  satisfactorily  ad(cid:173)
dressed in this work is the question of generalizability. The generalizabil(cid:173)
ity of the present results is limited in two respects. First, the evidence for 
concurrent validity was based entirely on correlations with data based on 
hypothetical and self-reported situations. It would be preferable to dem(cid:173)
onstrate relationships based on observations of actual vengeful behaviours. 
'Ibis  presents  difficulties,  however,  as  vengeance,  by  its  very  nature, 
typically  involves  serious  acts  of aggression.  It is  difficult  to  justify 
exposing participants to revenge-eliciting situations merely for the pur-

pose of collecting evidence for concurrent validity. It might, however, be 
possible in future research to use the Prisoner's Dilemma, in which the 
choice on the final round could be interpreted as  vengeance.  A second 
consideration regarding the generalizability of the present results sterns 
from  the  fact  that the  respondents  were  al1  university  undergraduates 
(although  the  sampIes  that were  used were  more representative  of the 
general population in terms of age, marital status, occupation and ethnicity 
than  sampies  composed  entirely  of full-time  undergraduates).  Further 
research using respondents from such venues as courts, mediations, and 
prisons would give additional evidence of generalizability. 

Although the literature on revenge shows very different perspectives 
taken by different disciplines, there are indications of an interdisciplinary 
consensus  that revenge is  a powerful  motivating  factor  for  aggressive 
acts, such as rape and vandalism. In the main, the research on vengeful(cid:173)
ness that has been conducted in the areas of psychology and psychiatry 
has  been  limited  to  the  effects  of revenge,  rather  than  on  aspects  of 
revenge  itself,  or  on  the  interaction  of attitudes  toward  revenge  with 
situational variables. This may be due, in part, to the lack of an ins trument 
to measure individual differences in attitudes toward revenge. The Ven(cid:173)
geance Scale presented here is intended to provide such an instrument
