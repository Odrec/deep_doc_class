ABSTRACT. Biomass content and turnover rate were estimated for a lowland wet
rain forest in French Guiana. A regression model relating the biomass of a tree to
its dbh (diameter at breast height) was deduced from previously published data. A
power-law allometric relationship of the form AGTB = aDb was used to estimate the
tree biomass, AGTB (Mg ha–1), from its dbh D (cm). Using direct measurements of
tree biomass in the literature, the best-ﬁt allometric exponent b = 2.42 (SD = 0.02)
was found. The logarithm of the coefﬁcient a was normally distributed with an aver-
age of - 2.00 (SD = 0.27). This method was applied to two permanent research sta-
tions of the lowland tropical rain forest of French Guiana: the Nouragues and Piste
de Saint-Elie. At the Nouragues, the biomass was estimated from trees 10 cm in dia-
meter on two plots covering a total surface area of 22 ha and yielded an average bio-
mass of 309 Mg ha- 1 (– 32 Mg ha- 1, 95% conﬁdence interval). Spatial variability was
also addressed at the Nouragues by estimating the biomass of trees M 30 cm dbh over
a total surface area of 82 ha. For the wet tropical forest vegetation type, an average
of 284 Mg ha- 1 was obtained (spatial variability – 55 Mg ha- 1). Biomass turnover was
evaluated at Piste de Saint-Elie from two transects (0.78 and 1 ha) on which all trees
M 5 cm in diameter were recorded and mapped twice in 10 y. Transect 1 showed a
slight increase in biomass, from 245 to 260 Mg ha- 1 (338 to 345 Mg ha- 1 for transect
2), corresponding to a net increase of 1.9 Mg ha- 1 y- 1 (0.7 Mg ha- 1 y- 1), and the bio-
mass ingrowth was 3.2 Mg ha- 1 y- 1 (2.8 Mg ha- 1 y- 1). These ﬁgures are discussed in
the light of the natural recruitment dynamics of tropical forests.

INTRODUCTION

Biomass is an important parameter for characterizing a forest ecosystem. The
efﬁciency of carbon storage in organic matter reﬂects the quality of environ-
mental conditions: climate, soil structure and nutrient availability. A precise
