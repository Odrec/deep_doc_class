FIDUCIARY  RELATIONSHIPS

L.  S.  SEALY

THE  branch  of  equity  which  deals  with  fiduciary  relationships  does
not  receive  a  great  deal  of  attention  in  legal  works,  and  what  has
been  written  is  not  usually  very  full  or  very  precise. 
It  is  pro-
posed,  therefore,  in  this  article,  first,  to  explore  something  of  the
background  and  development  of  this topic,  secondly,  to  discuss  the
problem  of  defining  a  fiduciary  situation  and,  thirdly,  to  suggest,
in  outline  at  least,  a  classification  of  the  relationships  and  the
principles which apply  to each  class.

"  CONFIDENCE,"  TRUSTS  AND  FIDUCIARY  RELATIONSHIPS

Breach  of  trust,  or  confidence,  is  one  of  the  traditional  heads  of
jurisdiction  in  Chancery:

These three  give place in  court  of  conscience,
Fraud,  accident,  and  breach  of  confidence.1

From  this  branch  of  equity  we derive,  of  course,  the  whole  of  our
law  of  trusts;  but  matters  of  confidence  in  earlier  times  covered  a
good  deal  more  ground  than  trusts  of  property  as  we  know  then1
today.  In  the  reports  of  eighteenth-  and  early  nineteenth-century
cases we find the word used in many different  contexts.  A was said
to  have  confidence  reposed  in  him  by  B  not  only  where  B  had
entrusted  A with  property  to  hold  and  deal  with  on  behalf  of  him-
self  or  others—as  in  the  trust  strictly  so  called—but  also  where  A
undertook  to  exercise  a  power,  to  conduct  a  sale,  to  supervise  an
estate or business, or in some other  way to become B's  employee  or
agent.  Confidence  was  also reposed  where  B  was  dependent  on  A's
advice,  perhaps  because  A was  a  professional  adviser  or  expert,  or
more  familiar  with  the  subject-matter;  because  A was  on  the  spot
and  B  at  a  distance;  or because  A was a  trusted  servant  or  friend,
or  a  person  of  dominant  character  or  position  who  was  able  to
influence  B's  decisions.  Again,  confidence  might  be  induced  where
A by  words  or  conduct  represented  to  B  that  he  would  deal  fairly
with  him. 
In  all  these  cases  the  broad  general  principle  applied
was

that  if  a  confidence  is  reposed,  and  that  confidence  is  abused,
a  court  of equity  shall give relief.2
Our  ancestors  did  not  mince  words:  many  of  these  matters of
confidence  were  naturally  called  "  trusts,"  whether  there  was any
strict  trust  of  property  or  not.3  Nor,  of  course,  has  the  law  a
monopoly  of  this  word  today:  it  is  good  English,  for  instance,  to
say  that  a  person  entering  some  employment  or  taking  up  an
appointment,  whether  public  or  private,  is  undertaking  or  accept-
ing  a  "  trust."  So, in the  eighteenth  century,  in  Charitable  Cor-
poration  v.  Sutton,4  Lord  Hardwicke  said  of  the  board  of
"  committee-men  "  of the corporation  that  they  were

most  properly  agents  to  those  who employ  them  in  this  trust,
and  who empower them  to direct  and superintend  the affairs of
the  corporation

and  later  5:

Nor  will  I  ever  determine  that  a  court  of  equity  cannot  lay
hold  of  every  breach  of  trust,  let  the  person  be  guilty  of  it
either  in  a  private  or  public  capacity.
An  earlier  chancellor,6  who was asked  to interfere  in  the  choice
of  a  school  which  had been  made  by  the guardians  of  an infant,  is
reported  to have  interrupted  counsel  to say "  with  some warmth  "
that  "  the guardians  were but  trustees  "  and  that

as  the  court  would  interpose,  where  the  estate  of  a  man was
devised  in  trust,  so would  it  a  fortiori  concern  itself,  on  the
custody of a child's being devised to a guardian, who was but a
person  intrusted  in  that  case.  .  •  .  That  if  any  wrong  steps
had  been  taken  .  .  • the  court  would  interpose  and  order  the
contrary;  and  that  this  was grounded  upon  the  general  power
and  jurisdiction  which  it had over  all trusts,  and  guardianship
was most  plainly a trust.
So long  as the relief  meted  out  by the Lord  Chancellor  followed
broad  principles  and involved  a  degree  of  discretion,  a  simple  legal
vocabulary  relying  on general  words  such  as "  trust  "  and "  confi-
dence  "  was  adequate. 
In  time,  however,  discretion  based  on
broad  principles  gave  way  to  concrete  rules,  and  as  this  process
neared  completion,  we can  see  from  the  reports  that  a  standard

technical  vocabulary  was  gaining  recognition.

reporting  and  the  publication  of  several  textbooks  7  no  doubt
assisted  in  this  development.  Descriptive  words,  like  "  confi-
dence," which  once dominated  this  entire field, gave  way  to  precise
terms,  which  were  better  suited  to  the  formulation  of  fixed  rules.
One  noticeable  change  was  that  the  word  "  trust  "  came  to  be
recognised  as  a  formal  term  with  its  modern  technical  meaning.
This  was  all  very  well;  but  it  meant  that  the  other  situations
formerly  described  vaguely  as  "  trusts  "  were  now  left  without  a
name.  The  reports  of  cases  decided  in  the  early  years  of  the  nine-
teenth  century  show  that  there  was  considerable  uncertainty  at
that  time  whether  these  situations  could  still  be  termed  "  trusts."
Counsel  in  York  Buildings  Co.  v.  MacKenzie,* in  1795,  was  obvi-
ously  put  to  some  pains  to  express  himself  when  he  pleaded  in
these  words for  the  application  of  the  traditional  principles:

The  office  of  a  common  agent9  has  already  been  described
in  this  case,  and  it  is  needless  to  enter  into  refinements  or
niceties  as  to  the  nature  of  trusts,  or  the  specific  name  of
trusts.  There  is  no  magic  in  the  term:  He  is  a  trustee  (in
technical  style) who is vested  with  property  in  trust  for  others;
but  every  man  has  a  trust,  to  whom  a  business  is  committed
by  another,  or  the  charge  and  care  of  any  concern  is  confided
or  delegated.  .  .  .

Before  long  it  became  customary  to  qualify  the  use  of  the  language
of  trust  and  trustee  in  this  sense  with  some  explanation  or
apology;  one  spoke  of  a  "  quasi-trust,"  or  said  that  the  relation-
ship  was  "  in  some  respects  "  or  "  for  limited  purposes  "  one  of
trusteeship.  In  1820, Lord  Eldon  said  1 0:

.  .  .  there  is  a  vast  difference  between  things  to  which  we
give the  same  denomination,  I  mean  trusts.  You  have  a  trust
expressed;  you  have  a  trust  implied;  you  have  relations
formed  between  individuals  in  the  matters  in  which  they  deal
with  each  other,  in  which  you  can  hardly  say  that  one  of  them
is  a  trustee  and  the  other  a  cestui  que  trust;  and  yet  you
cannot  deny,  that  to  some  intents  and  some  purposes  one  is  a
cestui  que  trust  and  the  other  a  trustee.

Eventually,  it  seems  to  have  become  the  established  usage  to
concede  that  in  these  situations  there  was  no  trust,  and  instead  to
assert  merely  that  the  relationship  was  similar  to  that  between
trustee  and  cestui  que  trust.  The  word  fiduciary  (which  earlier

alia) Jeremy,  Lewin,  Maddock,  Mitford,  Seton  and  Story.

had  received  very  little judicial  support) "  was adopted  to  describe
these  situations  which  fell  short  of  the  now  strictly-defined  trust.

FIDUCIARY  RELATIONSHIPS  IN  MODERN  LAW

Today,  the  word  " fiduciary " 
is  still  sometimes  used  in  an
indefinite  and  descriptive  sense,  so  that  it  embraces  all  trust-like
situations  including  the trust  itself,12  but  it  is more  precisely  used,
in  contrast  with trusts proper, in reference  to those situations which
are in  some respects  trustlike  but  are  not,  strictly  speaking, trusts.
The law of  trusts is well recognised as a separate branch  of the law,
with its own textbooks and its own rules and  principles, now highly
developed.  The  law  of  fiduciary  relationships  will  not,  in  general,
be found  in  those  textbooks, but  the rules  and  principles governing
these relationships  are—in essence and  in  origin—the same  as those
of  the law of  trusts.  This point  was made by Fry  J.  in Ex  p. Dale
Sf Co.;  he said  »:

What  is a fiduciary relationship ?  It  is one in respect  of which
if  a wrong  arise, the same remedy exists  against  the wrongdoer
on  behalf  of  the  principal  as  would  exist  against  a  trustee  on
behalf  of  the  cestui que  trust.

Fry J.'s  definition  "  emphasises the essential quality of  all fiduciary
relationships:  every  remedy  which  can  be  sought  against  a

11 An  early  instance  of  the use of  the  word  by  a  judge  is  in  Bishop  of  Winchester
v.  Knight  (1717)  1  P.Wms.  406,  407,  per  Cowper  L.C.,  in  proceedings  by  a
landlord  for  an  account  of  ore  dug  by  a  tenant:  " . .. 
it  is  stronger  in  this
case  by  reason  that  the  tenant  is  a  sort  of  fiduciary  to  the  lord,  and  it  is  a
breach  of  the  trust  which  the  law  reposes  in  the  tenant,  for  him  to  take  away
the  property  of  the  lord."  Other  early  examples  include:  Woodhouse  v.
Meredith  (1820)  1 Jac.  & W.  204, 213  (counsel);  Oliver v.  Court  (1820)  8 Price
127,  143  (counsel);  Cholmondeley  v.  Clinton  (1820)  2  Jac.  &  W.  1,  183
(Plumer  M.E.);  Docker  v.  Somes  (1834)  2  My.  &  K.  655,  665  (Lord
Brougham);  but  use  is  uncommon  before  the  1850s.  Much  of  the  pioneering
work  was  done  by  the  textbook  writers:  Jeremy  (1828),  Lewin  (1837),  Mad-
dock  (3rd  ed.,  1837)  and  Story  (2nd  ed.,  1839)  all  make  use  of  the  expression.
12  See,  e.g.  the  learned  editor  of  Maitland,  Equity  (note  1,  supra),  229;  33
Halsbury  (Hailsham  ed.)  88  and  references  cited  ibid. 
In  the  American
Restatement  of  the  Law  of  Trusts  (2nd  ed.,  1959)  Vol.  1,  §  2,  a  trust  is
denned  as  a  type  of  fiduciary  relationship.

fiduciary  15  is  one  which  might  be  sought  against  a  trustee  on  the
same grounds.  But  it  is really  not  a  definition  at  all:  although  it
describes  a  common  feature,  it  does  not  teach  us  to  recognise  a
fiduciary relationship  when  we meet  one.  Still less does  it  assist  us
when  we  are  faced  with  a  particular  relationship  and  asked  the
practical  question:  does  a  certain  principle  of  the  law  of  trust  and
trustee  apply ?  John  is my  agent  and  is therefore,  on  good  autho-
rity,  in  a  fiduciary  position  towards  me.  Does  this  mean  that  he
must  not  mix  with  his  own  money  the  sums  which  he  holds  on  my
account ?  Is  there  a presumption  of  undue  influence  if  I  make  him
a gift ?  Is he disqualified  from  becoming the  lessee of land  formerly
held  by  me,  after  I  have  failed  to  secure  a  renewal  of  the  lease  for
myself ?  Do  all  the  trust  principles  apply  to  this  fiduciary  situa-
tion ?  When  we  examine  the  authorities,  we  learn—perhaps  with
some  surprise—that  this  is  not  so.  The  word  "  fiduciary,"  we
find,  is  not  definitive  of  a  single  class  of  relationships  to  which  a
fixed  set  of  rules  and  principles  apply.  Each  equitable  remedy  is
available  only  in  a  limited  number  of  fiduciary  situations;  and  the
mere  statement  that  John  is in  a  fiduciary  relationship  towards  me
means  no  more  than  that  in  some  respects  his  position  is  trustee-
like;  it  does not  warrant  the  inference  that  any  particular  fiduciary
principle  or  remedy  can  be  applied.

Fletcher  Moulton  L.J.  once warned  against  what  he called  "  the
danger  of  trusting  to  verbal  formulae  "  in  this  way.16  After  illu-
strating  a number  of fiduciary situations  and  describing  the  ways in
which  the  courts  had  interfered  to  grant  relief  in  these  cases,  he
said  ":

Thereupon  in  some  minds  there  arises  the  idea  that  if  there  is
any  fiduciary  relation  whatever  any  of  these  types  of  interfer-
ence  is  warranted  by  it.  They  conclude  that  every  kind  of
fiduciary relation  justifies  every  kind  of  interference.  Of  course
that  is  absurd.  The  nature  of  fiduciary  relation  must  be  such
that  it  justifies  the  interference.
It  is  obvious  that  we  cannot  proceed  any  further  in  our  search
for  a  general definition  of  fiduciary  relationships.  We  must  define
them  class  by  class,  and  find  out  the  rule  or  rules  which  govern
each  class.  In  this  task,  we  receive  little  help  from  the  cases,  or
even  the  textbooks.18  The  judges  in  most  cases  have  been  more

ready  to  find  that  the  type  of  fiduciary  situation  upon  which  their
decision  depends  does or  does  not  exist,  than  to  say  what,  for  that
purpose,  amounts  to  such  a fiduciary position.  Indeed,  in very  few
cases  has  there  been  anything  more  than  a  ruling  that  the  situation
is or  is  not  "  fiduciary,"  without  regard  to  the  warning  of  Fletcher
Moulton  L.J.  that  this  is  not  taking  the  inquiry  far  enough. 
In
order  to  know  whether  a  particular  rule  of  equity  is  applicable  we
must  know  whether  the situation  is  "  fiduciary  "  in  the  appropriate
special sense.19

A  CLASSIFICATION OF  FIDUCIARY RELATIONSHIPS

The  authorities  seem  to  suggest  that  there  are  four  20 categories of
fiduciary  relationship.  The  first  two  classes  are  reasonably  capable
of  definition;  the  third  and  fourth,  which  are  concerned  with  the
application  of  presumptions,  are  probably  not  definable  except  by
reference  to  precedent.  A description  of  the four  categories  follows,
with  a  brief  summary  of  the  equitable  rules  which  apply  in  each
case.

Category I

Where  one  person  has  control21  of  property  which  (whatever
may  be the  position  at law)  22 in  the  view  of  a  court  of  equity  is  the

1959),  214 it is suggested  that   a relationship  may be  more  or less  fiduciary and
that  some  rules  will   not apply  unless  " the  agency  is  of  an  exceptionally
fiduciary  character,"  but we  are not   told  where  to draw  the  line.  Cf. also  1
Halsbury  (Simonds  ed.),  182.

In   Underhill,  Trusts  and  Trustees 

(11th  ed.,

is  It   would  undoubtedly  be simpler  to  keep  "  fiduciary  "  as  a  comprehensive
term,  as most  lawyers  probably  regard   i t;  but  the   judges  have  very  commonly
based  their  reasoning   on a  finding  that  a  party  is or is not in a  " fiduciary  "
position  in such  a way that  their  statements   are intelligible  only  if the term is
understood  to have  been  used   in a  very  special  limited  sense;   cf. note  26 and
note  57,  infra.

20  There  is possibly  a  fifth  sense  in which  the  word  "  fiduciary  "  might  be used,
in  relation  to the  obligation  of bankers,  doctors,  solicitors   and  others  not to
divulge  confidential 
information.  The authorities  differ  on  the  question
whether  the  disclosure  by A of information  concerning  B is properly  regarded
as  a  breach  of a  fiduciary  obligation;  modern  cases   are  usually  based  on  con-
tract,  express   or implied,  and  the   remedy  sought  is damages,  or damages  and
an  injunction.  Cf. Toumier  v.  National  Provincial  Bank 
[1924]  1 K.B.  461,
Carter v. Palmer  (1842)  8 Cl.  & F. 657,  707 and  Robb v. Green [1895]  2 Q.B.
315.  Of course,  a fiduciary who  uses  information  belonging  to his beneficiary
for  his own  profit  (Regal  (Hastings)  Ltd v.  Gulliver  [1942]  1 All B.E. 378,
382)  or  sells  it  (Beaumont  v.  Boultbee  (1802)  7  Ves. 599, 607-608)  must
account  to his  beneficiary,  but these  situations  are  covered  by categories  I and
H  in the text.

21 In the sense  that  he has  power  to dispose  of it;  whether  he has authority to
dispose of it is irrelevant.  Cf. Kekewich  J.  in Re Barney,  Barney  v. Barney
[1892] 2 Ch.  265, 276:  "money  under  his  control  . . . means  money  which he
can,  if he will,  put into  his  own  pocket  or pay away  as he pleases  to some-
body  else."

11   The legal  title  may  be in the  fiduciary, the beneficiary  or  some  third  party.

property  of  another,  the  fiduciary  position  of  the  former  is  very
close  indeed  to  that  of  a  trustee.  Guardians,  bailiffs  and  stewards
usually  come  into  this  category;  and  so  also  does  a  person  who
receives  property  for  a  purpose  which  cannot  be  carried  out.23
Agents,  solicitors,  company  directors  and  promoters,  partners  and
even  bankers  are  also  included  when  they  handle  or  hold  property
on  behalf  of  their  beneficiary—provided 
that  they  do  not  hold  the
property  as debtor.2*  No  trust  can,  of  course,  exist  where  there  is
a  debtor-creditor  relationship: 
in  equity,  "  restitution  stopped
where repayment  began."  23  The  existence  of  this  class of  fiduciary
relationship  was one  of  the  grounds  on  which  the  original  equitable
jurisdiction  in  account  lay.26  Such  a  relationship  must  also  be
established  before  the  doctrine  of  tracing  may  be  invoked  in
equity.27  A  fiduciary  who falls  within  this  category  must  keep  the
property  separate  from  his  own,  and  he  is  debarred  from  trading
with  it  for  his  own  benefit.28  The  effect  on  the  fiduciary's  obliga-
tions  of  death,29  bankruptcy  30  and  the  lapse  of  time  81  is,  and
always  has  been,  the  same  as  applies  in  the  case  of  a  trustee.

23  e.g.,  the  directors  in  Sinclair  v.  Brougham 

[1914]  A.C. 398; see the   judgment
of  Lord  Parker   at  441, and   that  of  Viscount  Haldane   L.C.  at  421.   Some
authorities  would  extend 
this  rule   so  as  to   include  any  "  conscious  wrong-
doer  "  (Scott,  "Constructive  Trusts   "  (195S)  71 L.Q.E.  39, 48), e.g.  a  thief  of
money  or  negotiable  securities;   but  the   better  view  would  appear   to  be   that,
although  there   is  a  "  continuing  right   of  property  "  (Re  Diplock,  Diplock  v.
Wintle 
[1948]  Ch. 465, 520)  sufficient  to  invoke  the doctrine  of  tracing  there   is
not,  without  more,   a  fiduciary  relationship.  Scott,   op.  cit.,  seems  to  support
this  view.  Perhaps   the  rule  stated   in  the   text  is  confined  to  borrowing  trans-
actions;  cf.  Buckley  on  the  Companies  Acts  (13th ed.,   1957), 25.

in  cases  of  agency.  Account   lay in   equity  against   an  agent  on  three  principal
grounds:  (i)  that  the  accounts  were  mutual;   (ii)  that  they  were  complicated;
(iii)  that  there  existed   a  fiduciary  relationship. 
In  (iii) the   obligation  was to

Category  II

This  type  of  fiduciary  situation  arises,  in  the  words  of  Asquith
L.J.  in  Reading  v.  B., 32  "  whenever  the  plaintiff  entrusts  to  the
defendant  a  job  to  be performed."  Any  person  will find himself  in
such  a  situation  if  he has undertaken  or is under  an  obligation  (not
necessarily  contractual3S) 
to  act  on  another's  behalf  or  for
another's  benefit,  or  is  deemed  in  equity  to  have  done  so.84 
In
this  case  the  fiduciary  has, in the  eyes of  equity,  a  "  trust  "  in  the
sense  of  employment,  commission  or  charge.  Sometimes 
the
"  trust  "  will be self-imposed.85  But  no property  need be involved,
and  so,  although  almost  the  whole  of  Category  I  will  usually  fall
also  under  this  head,  many  other  relationships  are  included—for
instance  employer  and  employee,  the  Crown  and  its  servants,36  and
solicitors,  agents,  partners,  directors  and  promoters  even  when
their  activities  do not  involve the  control  of  property.

The  attitude  of  equity  towards  a  fiduciary  in  this  category  is,
essentially,  to  see  that  he  acts  consistently  with  his  undertaking.
The  fiduciary  may  be  under  no  duty  whatsoever;  the  obligation
may  be  merely  a  favour  voluntarily  undertaken,  and  not  in  any
sense  enforceable  either  at  law  or  in  equity.  But  the  court  will
insist  that,  if  a  person  who  has  engaged  to  act  for  the  benefit  of
another  acts  at  all,  he  acts  honestly,  diligently  and  entirely  as  he
has  undertaken;  and  it  demands  that  neither  he, nor  anyone  claim-
ing  through  him,  should  seek  to  uphold  a  situation  which  does  not
fully  accord  with  the  intention  which  he  has  manifested  or  held
himself  out  as having.  In particular,  the undertaking by a fiduciary
to  act  for  another  carries  with  it  the  assumption  that  he  will  not
act  in  his  own  interest;  in  the  words  of  Lord  Loughborough  3 r:

he,  who  undertakes  to  act  for  another  in  any  matter,  shall  not
in  the  same  matter  act  for  himself.
This  principle  has  two main  consequences.

33  Cf.  Scott,  " T he  Fiduciary Principle"  (1949) 37   Calif.L.B.  539, 540: " A  fiduciary
It  is
is  a  person  who  undertakes  to  act  in  the  interest  of  another  person. 
immaterial  whether  the  undertaking  is  in  the  form  of  a  contract. 
It  is  imma-
terial  that  the  undertaking  is  gratuitous ";  and  Lord  Macnaghten  in  hyell  v.
(1889)  14  App.Cas. 437,  463  (speaking  of  a  "  category  I  "  fiduciary):
Kennedy 
"  Nor  do  I 
think  it  can  make  any  difference  whether  the  duty  arises  from
contract  or  is  connected  with  some  previous  request,  or  whether  it  is   self-
imposed  and  undertaken  without  any  authority  whatever."

Fiduciary  Relationships 

77

First,  the  beneficiary  will  not  be  held  bound  by  any  contract
which  has been  entered  into by  or  through  the  fiduciary,  where  the
latter's  position  was  such  as  to  prejudice,  or  be likely  to  prejudice,
the  honest  and  full  discharge  of  his  undertaking.  For  example,  a
principal  may  avoid  at  his  option  a  contract  in  which  his  agent,
employed  to  sell,  is secretly  interested  as  purchaser.38

Secondly,  equity will refuse  to permit  the fiduciary to claim  that
he  has  done  for  himself  something  which  might  have  been  done  by
him  in  pursuance  of  his  undertaking  or  in  discharge  of  his  obliga-
tion.  Thus, if  a fiduciary happens  to  acquire  at  a discount  debts  or
securities  enforceable  against  his  beneficiary,  he  cannot  claim  to
enforce  them  at  their  nominal  value,  but  must  give  bis  beneficiary
the  benefit  of  the  discount.39  The  fiduciary  may  have  been  under
no  duty  at  all  to  acquire  the  securities;  but,  having  done  so,  he
may  not  claim,  inconsistently  with  his  position,  that  he  did  so  on
his  own  behalf.  A  modern  extension  of  this  rule,  the  limits  of
which  are  not  yet  settled,  is  the  proposition  that  a  fiduciary  is
bound  to  surrender  to  his  beneficiary  all  "  secret  profits  "  received
by  the  fiduciary  by  reason  of  his  position,  whether  the  beneficiary
has  a  proprietary  or  even  a  moral  claim  to  them  or  not.40

In  Keech  v.  Sandford  41  the  trustee  of  a  lease,42  who  had  been
unsuccessful  in  obtaining  a  renewal  of  the  lease  for  his  cestui  que
trust,  took  a renewal in his own name  and  claimed  to be entitled  to
it  beneficially.  The  court,  however,  ruled  that  it  must  be  held  on
trust  on the same terms  as the  original lease.  This  case is  authority
for  two  propositions  which  are  not  always  distinguished  4 3:  first,
the  rule,  which  we  have  already  discussed,  that  persons  in  a
"  fiduciary  "  position  may  not  make  a  profit  from  their  situation;
and,  secondly,  the  rule  applicable  to  trustees,  life-tenants,  mort-
gagees  in  possession,  and  other  persons  with  limited  or  partial
interests  in  property  (usually  leaseholds)  whereby  in  certain  cir-
cumstances  renewed  or  additional  ** rights  obtained  by  any  such
person  are deemed  to be  an  accretion  to  the  original  property,  with

the result that  he is allowed no greater  rights  in regard  to the accre-
tion  than  he  has  or  had  in  the  property  originally  held.  In  so  far
as  Keech  v.  Sandford  is  authority  for  the  first  of  these  rules,  the
relationship  between  the  parties  is  "  fiduciary  "  in  sense  II  above.
There  is,  however,  authority  supporting  the  view  that  the  term
"  fiduciary  "  is,  in  a  third  special  sense,  of  significance  in  relation
to  the  second  of  these  propositions.  Some  authorities  consider  that
a/2  the  relationships  affected  by  either  proposition  are  "  fidu-
ciary  "  4S;  others  suggest  that  "  fiduciary  "  describes  only  those
situations  which  give  rise  to  an  irrebuttable  presumption  of  law
that  the  new  property  is  held  on  the  same  terms  as  the  old  (in
which  case  the  "  fiduciary  "  relationships  include  a  life-tenant46);
while others suggest  that  some only of this last  class of  relationships
should  be termed  "  fiduciary,"  and  would  exclude  the  life-tenant.47
The third  of these  usages is rather indefinite,  but either  of  the  other
uses  of  the  term  "  fiduciary  "  requires  us  to  recognise  this  as  a
separate  category,  for  it includes  a life-tenant  at  least.

Category IV

Here  we  are  concerned  with  the  doctrine  of  undue  influence.
A contract  between  A and B  may be  set  aside by A on  the  grounds
of  B's  undue influence;  it  may  also be  upset  on the  grounds  that  B
occupied  a  fiduciary  position  (Category  II  above)  towards  A,  and
failed  to  disclose  his  interest  in  the  transaction. 
It  is  probably
correct,  in  modern  law,*8 to  distinguish  between  these  two  grounds
for  the  avoidance  of  contracts:  the  requirements  of  proof  and
the  defences  open in  each  case are  distinguishable.49  Moreover,  the
doctrine  of  undue  influence  applies  also  to  gifts. 
In  defining  the
relationships  in  which  undue  influence  may  occur,  the  authorities  50
use  the  term  "  fiduciary  "  in  what  is,  it  is  submitted,  a  fourth

Lewin,  The  Law  of  Trusts  (15th  ed.,  1950), 155 et  seq.

*s  In  the  time  of  Lord  Eldon,  it  is  probable  that  the  two  cases  would  have  been

treated  alike  as  breaches  of  "  confidence."

based  on  the  fiduciary  principle:  see  17  Halsbury  (Simonds  ed.)  674.

so  Poce  Winder,  op.  cit.  (note  18,  supra),  who  is  unwilling  to  admit  any
suggested  connection  between  "  confidence  "  or  fiduciary  relationships  and  the
doctrine  of  undue  influence—even  to  the  extent  of  describing  some  remarks  of
Lord  Chelmsford  as  "  unfortunate,"  and  James  L.J.  as  "  ensnared  by  the
analogy"  (282);  but,  with  respect,  the  learned  contributor's  view  is  inconsis-
tent  with  a  long  line  of  authorities  going  back  to  Eldonian  times.

sense.  Once  again,  however,  the  authorities  are  not  in  full  agree-
ment.  Some  take  "  fiduciary  "  as  embracing  all  situations  where
undue  influence  may  exist.51  Others  use  this word  to  describe  only
those  out  of  this  wider  class  of  relationships  which  involve  a  pre-
sumption  that  undue  influence  has  been  exercised.52 
In  the  third
place, it  is sometimes  suggested  that  while the  scope of  the  doctrine
of  undue  influence—or  of  the  presumption  referred  to  above 5S—
includes fiduciary relationships,  or  some  of  them,  it  also  extends  to
certain  other  relationships  which  are  not  fiduciary.54  Either  of  the
first  two  of  these  uses  of  "  fiduciary  "  is  distinct  from  those  in
categories I,  II  and  III  above, for,  e.g.,  the  priest-devotee  relation-
ship  is  included55;  the  third  use  is  indeterminate  and  probably
merely  descriptive.

SIGNIFICANCE  OF  THE  CATEGORIES

The  four  categories  of  fiduciary  relationship  may  overlap:  a
guardian-ward  situation  may  fall  into  all  four,  and  a  solicitor-
client  relationship  into  three  at  least.  But  that  each  is  a  distinct
head  56 will be appreciated  when it  is realised  that  the  relationships
of  master  and  servant,  life  tenant  and  remainderman,  and  priest
and  devotee  will  usually  come  into  the  second,  third  and  fourth
groups  respectively,  but  will not,  as  such,  be  likely  to  fall  into  any
other.

Agents  will always  be classed  in  the  second  category,  and  some-
times  also included  in  the  first.57  Where  an  agent  handles  property

1955),  passim,  Salmond  and Williams,  Contracts  (1945), 291 (where  the use in
the  sense  of  the next  note  is  also  suggested);  semble,  Sheridan  (op cit.,  note
18,  supra), 87-88.

child,  guardian  and ward,  fiance  and  fiancee (but not husband  and  wife),  reli-
gious,  medical  and  other  advisers  and  those  who consult  them,  solicitor  and

in  categories  IH  and IV.

5T Hence  the rather  misleading  statements  in  14 Halsbury  (Simonds  ed.), 625n.:

"  an  agency  is not necessarily fiduciary "  (cf. 1 Halsbury  (Simonds  ed.),  182)
and  Piddocke v.  Burt  [1894]  1  Ch. 343, 346:  " it  is  not  every  agent  who is
fiduciary."  These  statements  fail  to  distinguish  between  the  different  mean-
ings of the term:  an agent  is always a fiduciary in  sense  II—he  may not  take
a  bribe—but  is  not  necessarily  a  fiduciary  in  senBe  I,  i.e.,  accountable  as a
trustee for  property  which  he receives.

for  his principal,  it  is often  a  difficult  question  of  fact  to  determine
whether  the  relationship  is,  at  a  certain  time,  to  be  classed  as
"  fiduciary  "  in  sense  I.58  The  issue  depends  on  the  terms  of  the
agreement  (if  any)  between  the  parties,  and  the  basis  on  which  the
property  is  intended  to  be  held. 
If  it  is  intended  to  be  held
throughout  on  the  principal's  behalf,  and  ultimately  to  be  yielded
up  (either  in  its  original  form,  or  an  altered  form,  or  with  the
increments  it  has  produced)  to  the  principal,  then  the  beneficial
ownership  of  the  principal  is  continuous,  and  the  relationship  is
fiduciary  within  Category  I. 
In  contrast,  the  intention  may  be
that  the  agent  shall  have  and  use  the  property  as  his  own;  his
obligation  is not  to pay or restore  the  property  or money  originally
received,  but  to  hand  over  equivalent  property  or  pay  a  similar
sum,  with  or  without  interest.  The property  either  never  has been
or  at  some point  ceases to  be  beneficially  the  principal's.  In  ascer-
taining  the  intention  of  the  parties,  the  court  will  have  regard  to
the  wording  of  the  contract,59  the  conduct  of  the  parties  (especially
the  question  whether  the  agent  has  kept  the  money  separate  from
his  own  60), mercantile  usage,61  and  any  other  evidence  which  may
help  to  show  the  nature  of  the  obligation  assumed  by  the  agent.
An  illustration  may  clarify  the  matter.62  If  I  send  my  car  to  a
dealer  to  sell  on  my  behalf,  he  is,  like  any  other  agent,  in  a fidu-
ciary  relationship  towards  me in  sense I I:  he may  not  take  a  bribe
from  the  purchaser,63  or secretly  buy  the  car  himself.64  Up  to  the
time  of  sale,  he  is  in  a  fiduciary  relationship  towards  me  in  sense
I:  he  holds  the  car  on  my  behalf.65  As  from  the  time  of  sale,
however,  he  is  almost  certainly  not  in  a  "  Category  I  "  fiduciary
situation  towards  me  as  regards  the  proceeds.66  As  in  almost  all

Fiduciary  Relationships

commercial  transactions,87  it  is understood  that  he will owe me  the
amount  of  the sale price, but  not  that  he will keep intact  the  actual
moneys  which  he  has  received  and  hold  them  for  my  benefit.  He
is my  debtor,  not  my  trustee.

An  even  more  difficult  issue  of  fact  arises  in  the  case  of  a
solicitor  employed  to  invest  money.  Whether  he  is  in  a  fiduciary
relationship  to  his  client  in  the  first  as  well  as  the  second  sense  is
likely  to  depend  on  whether  he  has  assumed  responsibility  for  the
selection  of  the  securities.68

In  the  words  of  Fletcher  Moulton  L.J.69  "  the  danger  of  trust-
ing  to  verbal  formulae  "  is  clear.  We  cannot  assume  that  a  rela-
tionship  properly  described  as  "  fiduciary  "  for  some  purposes  is
also " fiduciary "  in other senses.70

was  otherwise:  cf. Foley v. Hill  (1848) 2 H.L.Cas.  28,  35.
