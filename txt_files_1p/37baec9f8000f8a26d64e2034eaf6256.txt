Five criteria for evaluating Web pages

Evaluation of Web documents
1. Accuracy of Web Documents

How to interpret the basics

Who wrote the page and can
you contact him or her?
What is the purpose of the
document and why was it
produced?
Is this person qualiﬁed to write
this document?

2. Authority of Web Documents

Who published the document
and is it separate from the
"Webmaster?"
Check the domain of the
document, what institution
publishes this document?
Does the publisher list his or
her qualiﬁcations?

3. Objectivity of Web Documents

What goals/objectives does this
page meet?
How detailed is the
information?
What opinions (if any) are
expressed by the author?

4. Currency of Web Documents

When was it produced?
When was it updated?
How up-to-date are the links (if
any)?

Accuracy

Make sure author provides e-mail or a
contact address/phone number.
Know the distinction between author
and Webmaster.

Authority

What credentials are listed for the
authors?
Where is the document published?
Check URL domain.

Objectivity

Determine if page is a mask for
advertising; if so information might be
biased.
View any Web page as you would an
infommercial on television. Ask
yourself: why was this written and for
whom?

Currency

How many dead links are on the page?
Are the links current or updated
regularly?
Is the information on the page
outdated?
