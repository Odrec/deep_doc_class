FIDUCIARY OWNERSHIP AND TRUSTS IN A COMPARATIVE

PERSPECTIVE

DANIEL CLARRY*

Abstract Ownership is an essential feature of trusts that serves as a useful
analytical and comparative tool in order to cross legal traditions and compare
diﬀerent legal institutions, which to a greater or lesser extent serve similar
socio-economic and legal functions. The concentration on ownership enables
one to burrow down into the normative roots of diﬀerent legal traditions. This
article comprises three substantive parts: ﬁrst, characterizing ownership and
the manner in which this concept distinguishes the civil and common law
traditions; second, contextualizing ownership in relation to trusts from diﬀer-
ent legal systems; and, third, conceptualizing some contemporary challenges
arising out of the divergent nature of ownership in the phenomenology of
the trust paradigm, the value of the trust to comparative law and its eﬀect
on the civil law as a distinct tradition. It is argued that trusts necessarily
involve the ﬁduciary administration of property and that ‘ﬁduciary ownership’
is a better shorthand description of the encumbered nature of trust property,
rather than ‘dual’ or ‘split’ ownership, which is misleading and mistaken.

Keywords: comparative law, ﬁduciary ownership, international private law, property,
trusts.

I. INTRODUCTION

As in early English times, the trust continues to be an institution having a legal
existence that is driven by pragmatic praxis. Trusts are now used as a vehicle
for the management of vast ﬁnancial wealth.1 The evolution of trusts remains

demand-led and the law pertaining to trusts continues to lag behind the
realization of novel trust devices in contemporary ﬁnancial and legal practice.
Legal incursions in the ﬁeld of trusts occur in the most acute cases to correct
the trajectory of trust evolution from encroaching on mandatory rules of public
policy. The inherent ﬂexibility of the trust as a legal institution is perhaps the
secret behind the trust pandemic that has spread in recent times. According to
Lepaulle: ‘[trusts] are like those extraordinary drugs curing at the same time
toothache, sprained ankles, and baldness sold by the peddlers on the Paris
boulevards . . . What amazes the skeptical civilian is that they do really solve
them!’2 But, far from contenting ourselves that the trust is a magical elixir that
will cure what ails you, we need to understand how trusts work and use
appropriate terminology to describe the encumbered nature of ownership
in trusts. To that end, this article does not promise further trust alchemy but
takes a more sober look at the ownership structure of ‘trusts’ across diﬀerent
jurisdictions with a view to exposing the diverse treatment of ownership
throughout those trusts and making some constructive comments regarding
contemporary trusts law and practice in a comparative context. In doing so, it is
hoped that this study will stimulate further debate on the larger questions of
how the trust has inﬂuenced the civilian conception of ‘ownership’ and, in turn,
the civil law as a distinct legal tradition.3

jurisdictions considered, those institutions are expressly recognized as ‘trusts’

paid to where academics, practitioners and judges in those jurisdictions situate
‘ownership’ in those ‘trusts’—that is, in terms of who is regarded as the
‘owner’ of trust property. In doing so, this study reveals extensive fracturing
of the concept of ownership internationally as various jurisdictions have
attempted to embrace trusts in diﬀerent ways. Thus, the ownership of trust
property has been described as being in the beneﬁciary, settlor, trustee, and all
or none of the trust parties in at least one jurisdiction. On the basis of this study,
and further analysis of ‘ownership’ in trusts in the common law tradition, it
is argued that ‘ﬁduciary ownership’ is a better shorthand description of the

encumbered nature of ownership of trust property, rather than ‘dual’ or ‘split’
ownership in trusts, which is the root cause of much ambiguity in comparative
trust law and ought to be abandoned as being misleading and mistaken.
‘Dual ownership’ is misleading since it suggests that trusts comprise two
contemporaneous owners of property, which in turn relies on an overstated
historical division between the Common Law and Equity. ‘Split ownership’ in
trusts is mistaken in that it implies that ‘ownership’ is divided into discrete
incidents and apportioned between separate persons. The succinct phraseology
of
‘ﬁduciary ownership’ better communicates the encumbered form of
ownership of trust property and highlights the essential interplay between
ﬁduciary loyalty and trusteeship.

II. CLASSICAL PERSPECTIVES ON OWNERSHIP AND TRUSTS

It is important to understand the diﬀerent conception of ‘ownership’ in the civil
and common law traditions, especially as it is perceived to be a fundamental
point of distinction between them, before analysing how ‘ownership’ has been
strained by trusts as a subject in comparative law. The present comparative
study is predominantly concerned with legal systems within the broader civil
law tradition, but that study will be undertaken against the backdrop of the
ownership structure of trusts in the common law tradition. Notably, so-called
‘mixed’
jurisdictions—eg Louisiana, Quebec, Scotland, South Africa—
together with China and the Latin American countries all embody Roman-
based, or distinctly civilian-inspired, property law regimes, broadly adhere to
the civilian concept of ‘ownership’, and have, for some reason, tried to locate
‘ownership’ of trust property in anyone but the trustee.

A. The Common Law Conception of ‘Ownership’

From the mid-eighteenth century, the common law conception of ownership
was inﬂuenced greatly by Blackstone, whose famous commentaries pro-
claimed the ‘right of property’ to be that ‘sole and despotic dominium’.5 The
absolutist conception of property that was championed by Blackstone could
not, however, be reconciled with the multifarious threads of proprietary
interests that had been woven into the fabric of the common law tradition since
feudal times: ownership itself could be encumbered and fragmented amongst
many people in a variety of ways. Owing to the inability of the absolutist
conception of property to explain the fragmentation of ‘ownership’, further
attempts to deﬁne ‘ownership’ simply in terms of the relation between a person
and a right, such as Salmond’s analysis, failed to adequately deal with
the content of the ‘right’ that is the subject of ownership or to explain the

protection aﬀorded to an owner of property as a matter of law vis-à-vis other
persons (ie non-owners).6 A further enquiry into the legal positions of other
persons with respect to property owned by another person informs what
‘ownership’ practically meant as matter of law. But the single-minded view
of ownership in terms of a person’s relation to property of some amorphous
‘right’ did not engage with that enquiry and could not prevail as a com-
prehensive theory.

The common law was in need of a reconceptualization of ownership, which
came by moving away from a physicalist notion of ownership in property to
a metaphysical conception of intersubjective, juridical relations in relation to
property.7 The ‘bundle of rights’ theory of property was born, which remains
the predominant view that informs ownership in the common law tradition.8 In
that account, it is not the relation to the thing itself that is important but the
intersubjective relationships in relation to the thing that provides the analytical
and conceptual framework of property in the common law tradition.9 Thus,
‘[p]roperly understood then, “property is a bundle of rights” expresses the
thesis that property constitutes a legal complex, of various normative relations,
not simply rights’.10 Indeed, Hohfeld exposed that correlative ‘duties’ exist
ipso facto in the presence of ‘rights’; ‘rights’ and ‘duties’ being two sides of the
same coin, as it were.11 For this reason, the ‘bundle of rights’ theory could just
as well have been called the ‘bundle of duties’ theory or, even better, ‘bundle
of legal relations’ theory. However, such a suggestion might be seen as
scandalous in a legal tradition that reﬂects a Western culture possessed by its
possessions and obsessed with what rights one has over things, rather than
what duties we might owe one another in relation to things.12

Whilst the ‘bundle of rights’ theory made a signiﬁcant contribution in the
common law tradition by focusing on the relations between diﬀerent persons
with respect to property, it also brought with it the idea that constituent
components of the ‘bundle’ could themselves be divided or ‘split’ between
diﬀerent persons in various property-holding devices, including the trust.
Honoré gave the fullest account of ‘ownership’ by unpacking the concept into
11 constituent ‘incidents’: 1) the right to possess; 2) the right to use; 3) the
right to manage; 4) the right to income; 5) the right to capital; 6) the right
to security; 7) the incident of transmissibility; 8) the incident of absence
of term; 9) the prohibition of harmful use; 10) the liability to execution; and 11)

residuary character.13 The unity of those incidents of ownership monopolized
property for the owner but, according to Honoré, the incidents could also be
divided between two or more persons in diﬀerent forms of property-holding—
trusts, for example, ‘split ownership’ between two or more persons.14 Even on
this view, ownership is arguably even more complex than Honoré suggested,
as the identiﬁed incidents could themselves be dealt with in diﬀerent ways and
assigned to diﬀerent persons unequally. However, in Honoré’s account,

Ownership is important in our economic and legal culture because in the standard
case the owner combines a number of rights that together amount to a monopoly
over the thing owned, in particular the exclusive right to manage, enjoy, and
alienate it . . . But when the incidents of ownership are divided so that one person
administers and another person or object beneﬁts from the property, as is the case
with a trust, this monopoly does not exist.15

Fratcher similarly wrote, ‘[t]he trust is a legal device developed in England
whereby ownership of property is split between a person known as a trustee,
who has the right and powers of an owner, and a beneﬁciary, for whose
exclusive beneﬁt the trustee is bound to use those rights and powers.’16 Allied
to the notion that
the incidents of ownership are themselves divided or
split between a trustee and beneﬁciary is another fracturing of ownership
in jurisdictional terms, with the common usage of the terms ‘beneﬁcial owner’
and ‘legal owner’
to describe the position of beneﬁciary and trustee,
respectively.17 Although the pairing of those terms combine the functional
(‘beneﬁcial’ owner) with the jurisdictional (‘legal’ owner), the trust is ﬁrmly
situated in the traditional jurisdictional division between the Common Law and
Equity by the familiar expressions ‘equitable owner’ or ‘equitable ownership’,
as synonymous with ‘beneﬁcial ownership’.18 The jurisdictional dichotomy
that divides ‘ownership’ into legal and equitable ownership is tied to the
historical notion that only a Court of Equity will take notice of a trust and,
therefore, the Common Law treats the trustee as the (legal) owner of the
trust property, especially in the trustee’s dealings with third parties, as
though the trustee were the owner of the relevant property.19 The beneﬁciary

must hold the trustee to account for the administration of trust property
in Equity.20 In this sense, the dualistic conception of ownership is an historical
relic of the great dualism between the Common Law and Equity, in which the
trustee is the ‘legal owner’ of trust property and the beneﬁciary is concurrently
the beneﬁcial or equitable owner of that property.21

On this footing, trusts are impossible in civilian or mixed legal systems that
do not owe their heritage to the historical quirk of the English legal system.
When combined with the functional description of trusts splitting the incidents
of ownership, a powerful prophylactic is produced to prevent the reception
or transplantation of trusts.22 The dualistic conception of ownership in
which trust property has two contemporaneous owners is virtually ubiquitous
in the academic and judicial discourse in the common law tradition concern-
ing trusts, including many prominent trust commentaries.23 Indeed, in Ayerst
v C&K Construction Ltd, Lord Diplock began his speech in a unanimous
House of Lord’s judgment:

My Lords, the concept of legal ownership of property which did not carry with it
the right of the owner to enjoy the fruits of it or dispose of it for his own beneﬁt,
owed its origin to the Court of Chancery. The archetype is the trust. The “legal
ownership” of the trust property is in the trustee, but he holds it not for his own
beneﬁt but for the beneﬁt of the cestui que trust. Upon the creation of a trust in the
strict sense as it was developed by equity the full ownership in the trust property
was split into two constituent elements, which became vested in diﬀerent persons:
the “legal ownership” in the trustee, what came to be called the ‘beneﬁcial
ownership’ in the cestui que trust.24

This dualistic conception of ownership will be revisited in the ﬁnal section of
this article, with a view to exposing the common misconception found in this
notion and suggesting a move away from this description toward ﬁduciary
ownership of trust property.

B. The Civil Law Conception of ‘Ownership’

Not long after Blackstone had penned his classic Commentaries in England, on
the Continent the French Revolution brought a socio-political upheaval that
saw the reintroduction of an absolutist conception of property. Accordingly,
it is evident from art 544 in the French Civil Code—‘[l ]a propriété est le droit
de jouir et disposer des choses de la manière la plus absolue, pourvu qu’on
n’en fasse pas un usage prohibé par les lois ou par les règlements.’25—that a
robust conception of ownership was intended by the drafters of the Napoleonic
code. A protected sphere was created in which one could be the master of one’s
own domain. This brought with it an impassioned form of absolute ownership,
being the collective of the usus (right to use of the thing), fructus (right to its
fruits) and abusus (right to alienate or destroy the thing).26 The collective force
of these three features of civilian ownership is complete domination of the
particular thing and, for this reason, is considered to be the modern formulation
of dominium from Roman law.27 In the civil law tradition, ownership then
fundamentally evolved even more distinctly by the notion of patrimony: every
person has one, and only one, patrimony in which the rights (or assets) of
a person answer for the obligations (or liabilities) of that person.28 Thus, in
Quebec, we ﬁnd the parallel provision on patrimony: ’[t]oute personne est
titulaire d’un patrimoine’; ‘[e]very person has a patrimony’.29 Aubry and
Rau’s theory of patrimony was so profound to French legal heritage that one
French jurist claimed that French lawyers could not think about law at all
it.30 Although ‘patrimony’ has no meaning in the common law
without
tradition, it has usefully been deﬁned as the ‘[u]niversality of rights and
obligations having a pecuniary value in which rights answer for obligations’.31
Matthews neatly said, ‘patrimony is an expression of economic personality.’32
But not all real rights in the civil law are absolute: there exists a limited
category of recognized exceptions. The ﬁnal feature of the civilian conception
of ownership is the numerus clausus of real rights, which sets out a limited

25 Code civil des français, art 544 (translation by author: ‘ownership is the right to enjoy and
dispose of things in the most absolute manner, provided the usage is not prohibited by law or
regulations’).

law trusts: ﬁrst,

Traditionally, trusts have not been included in this closed list of real rights,
which leaves autonomous and indivisible ownership as a basic obstacle to
the acceptance of trusts in the civil law systems—this is the classical objection
to civil law trusts.35 According to Glenn, this individual and exclusive form of
civilian ownership made the trust impossible in Continental law.36 Put another
way, ‘the ownership of the trustee is not quite complete, not quite full enough’
for civilians, according to Matthews and also Lupoi.37 Bolgár neatly stated
the three main ‘obstacles’ to the reception of civil
the
unitary conception of ownership (‘inconsistent with duplication or division of
rights in rem in the same thing’); secondly , the doctrine of numerus clausus
(‘public registration of rights in rem involves taxative codiﬁcation of such
rights’); and, thirdly, the existence of similar devices already in the civil
law that facilitate, to some degree, the purposes of trusts (‘calculated for
practical reasons to escape the procrustean bed prepared for the evolution of
property law by the imperious logic of these conceptions’).38 The combined
force of these so-called ‘obstacles’ was said to furnish a ‘striking antinomy
between the common law and the civil law’39 and presented an ‘impassable
chasm’ between the two traditions.40 That approach has, and those objections
have, permeated contemporary trust
the manner in which
trusts are adapted in civil law systems ‘reveals and exacerbates the particularity
of a certain civilian way of understanding, articulating and regulating
ownership’.41 Indeed, in order to escape the notion that a trustee is the owner
of property encumbered by the terms of the trust, civil
law and mixed
jurisdictions have fragmented ownership in trusts in such a way that the civilian
conception of ownership is no longer a point of distinction, but rather
disintegration.

III. CONTEMPORARY PERSPECTIVES ON OWNERSHIP IN TRUSTS

Despite the linguistic lacuna in the prominent civilian languages of French
and German of there being no particular word ‘own’,42 one nevertheless ﬁnds
a ﬁxation on ownership in comparative trusts law, especially in the English
literature. The diﬀerent ownership structures in various civil law ‘trusts’ will
be considered in this section.43 The diﬀerent ‘trusts’ are grouped together
according to who is considered to be the owner of the trust property:
‘ownership’ might be said to be in the trustee or one or none of the other trust
parties. The focus will be on civilian legal institutions that are actually called
‘trusts’ by academics, legislators and judges, rather than ‘trust-like devices’,
with enough trusts being considered to show that the location of ‘ownership’ in
these trusts shifts around so much that the full complement of ownership
permutations are represented: in the settlor, the trustee, the beneﬁciary, all and
none of the trust parties. To balance the analysis of peculiar ownership
structures in civil law ‘trusts’, the ﬁnal ‘trust’ that is considered in this section
is one in which independent legal personality is conferred upon a ‘trust’ in the
common law tradition, thereby enabling it to own property, with the example
of a ‘statutory trust’ from the United States.

A. Trusts with Ownership in the Trustee

The ﬁrst group of trusts vests ownership in the trustee, but permits the trust
property to be held or managed for the beneﬁt of another person. Historically,
the use, usufruct and ﬁdeicommissum have this common trait. For example,
the ﬁdeicommissum has been unpacked into its constituent parts being ‘the
entrusting of an object (commissum) to the good faith ( ﬁdes) of the recipient,
for the beneﬁt of another person’,44 which does sound ‘trust-like’ to a common
lawyer.45 Other Roman law variants, such as use and usufruct, in which the full
incidents of ownership ( plenum dominium) were temporarily suspended and
only a bare or nominal ownership (nuda proprietas) was held by the owner
(dominus), with the other incidents of ownership being in the usufructuary
during that time, have also been likened to common law trusts.46 Interestingly,
in the substitution ﬁdeicommissaire, the ﬁduciary and the beneﬁciary are
regarded as ‘full owners’.47 Similarly, the ﬁducia is ‘full ownership with the
obligation in described circumstances to restore the asset to the transferor’.48

Interestingly, the ﬁdeicommissum of Roman times survives in a number of
civilian jurisdictions today.49

In modern times, a number of civilian jurisdictions accommodate
trusts that vest ownership in the trustee. The most notable example is
Scotland, where a ‘trust’ exists within a property framework with a civil law
persuasion.50 Scotland has accommodated the trust since the seventeenth
century without codiﬁcation and without a separate equitable jurisdiction.51
Ownership is in the trustee, with the trust property constituting a separate trust
patrimony segregated from the trustee’s personal patrimony.52 As early as
1681, the prominent Scots law commentator, Viscount Stair, wrote that ‘the
property of the thing intrusted be it land or moveables, is in the person of the
intrusted, else it is not a proper trust’.53 Despite this clear statement on
ownership in the Scottish trust, the courts toyed with the idea of ownership
being elsewhere. In 1892, it was stated that the beneﬁciary was the ‘true owner
as against all persons and for all purposes’, the role of the trustee merely being
that of an administrator.54 In 1898, it was considered that the beneﬁciary
held concurrent ownership with the trustee.55 Indeed, the confusion over the
ownership structure of Scottish trusts persisted for much of the last century.56
Whilst legislation was enacted in 1921 to regulate the proper functioning of the
Scottish trust, the Act did not attempt to clarify the precise nature of ownership
in the Scottish trust.57 Indeed, the term ‘trust’ was used within the deﬁnition
of ‘trust’, which admits of a certain circularity of logic: ‘“Trust” shall mean
and include . . . any trust . . .’.58 Other provisions did, however, imply that the
trustee was the owner of the trust property—eg upon resignation, the trustee is
‘divested of the whole property and estate of the trust, which shall accrue
to or devolve upon the continuing trustees or trustee’.59 In any event, the
position has since been authoritatively realigned with the earlier view that
the beneﬁciary does not own the trust property, but simply has a personal

South Africa has also had a remarkable experience with the trust. Owing
to its English and Dutch heritage, South Africa has developed two parallel
and conceptually distinct trusts: the ‘normal trust’ or ‘ownership trust’, in
which ownership is vested in the trustee; and, the ‘bewind trust’, in which
ownership is vested in the beneﬁciary.61 The history of the ﬁrst of those
trusts (ie the so-called ‘normal trust’ or ‘ownership trust’) in South Africa is of
interest to comparative lawyers.62 Essentially, the English settlors widely used
and employed trust terminology in the colony without any recognizable legal
infrastructure to accommodate the trust per se.63 This continued for a little
over a century until, in 1915, the South African Supreme Court of Appeal was
called upon to enforce one of these ‘trusts’. The Court held that South African
law had indeed adopted the English trust terminology (eg ‘trust’ and ‘trustee’),
but the English law of trusts did not form part of South African law nor had
the corpus of English trust law arrived on the shores with the settlors, who had
brought the trust with them in praxis.64 The South African Supreme Court of
Appeal held, ‘[t]he [trust] idea is now so ﬁrmly rooted in our practice, that it
would be quite impossible to eradicate it’ and gave eﬀect to the relevant trust
by equating it with a more familiar civilian legal institution, the ﬁdeicommis-
sum.65 The diﬀerence between trusts and ﬁdeicommissum was resolved, rather
bluntly, as being a mere matter of ‘phraseology’.66 Thus, the South African
experience of the trust provides an excellent example of a jurisdiction that has
not only embraced the trust, but has made the trust its own by accommodating
it within the broader schema of South African law.67 Importantly, the trustee
was regarded as the owner of the trust property and the beneﬁciary had a
personal right vis-à-vis the trustee with respect to the administration of the trust
(‘[i]t is trite law that the assets and liabilities in a trust vest in the trustee’).68 In
1984, the Supreme Court of Appeal ﬁnally unravelled the Gordian knot it had
tied earlier as a result of equating the ﬁdeicommissum with the trust.69 And,
in 1988, a trust explicitly vesting ownership in the trustee—the so-called
‘ownership trust’—found legislative endorsement.70

International and Comparative Law Quarterly

In Latin America, a number of countries have embraced the notion of
‘ﬁduciary ownership’ of property that is intended to beneﬁt another person
or fulﬁl some speciﬁc purpose—arrangements that are commonly translated
as ‘trusts’. Three brief examples will be given. In Argentina, a ‘trust’
( ﬁdeicomiso) exists where a person ( ﬁduciante) transfers ﬁduciary ownership
( propiedad ﬁduciaria) of certain assets to another person ( ﬁduciario), broadly
translated as a ‘trustee’, for the beneﬁt of the person identiﬁed in the relevant
contract (beneﬁcario), with the title to property being registered in the name
of the trustee.71 The introduction of that ﬁduciary institution brought with it
a reform of the full, civilian conception of ‘ownership’ (dominio) in the
Argentinian Civil Code to introduce the notion of ‘ﬁduciary ownership’
(dominio ﬁduciario), as an encumbered form of ownership that is created when
property is registered in the name of one person to be administered for the
beneﬁt of another.72 In Colombia, a trustee cannot
‘acquire deﬁnitely
the possession of [trust] assets’, with possession of trust assets returning to
the ‘ﬁduciant or his heirs’ unless some other provision is made for conveyance
to some other person.73 In Panama, a trust is a ‘juridical act’ whereby certain
property is ‘transferred by a person named the settlor to a person named the
trustee, for the purpose of managing or disposing thereof in favour of a cestui
que trust or beneﬁciary, who may be the settlor himself’.74 Very little is said in
the Panama Trust Law regarding ownership in the Panamanian trust, but
commentators consider ‘the trustee has all the rights and powers inherent to
ownership’.75 Indeed, the trustee as the ‘regular and real owner’, as well as the
‘true owner’, has been the prevailing view in Panama for some time, even
under prior legislative enactments.76 Trust property may be used and disposed
of subject to the terms of the trust; thus, ownership is encumbered by the
trust.77

In the Channel Islands, we ﬁnd similarly encumbered forms of ownership
in trusts in the bailiwicks of Guernsey and Jersey. In Jersey, ‘a trust exists
where a person (known as a trustee) holds or has vested in him or is deemed
to hold or have vested in him property (of which he is not the owner in his
own right)’.78 Thus, the trustee is the owner of the trust property but only in
his capacity as trustee; put another way, ‘ownership’ of the trust property
is encumbered by the terms of the trust and by Jersey law.79 The pervasive

English notion of dual ownership seeped into the drafting of the Trusts
(Jersey) Law 1984, where ‘[a] bona ﬁde purchaser for value without actual
notice of any breach of trust . . . may deal with a trustee in relation to trust
property as if the trustee was the beneﬁcial owner of the trust property’.80 As
early as 1896, one ﬁnds a reference to the notion of a ‘beneﬁcial owner’ in a
Jersey trust and a conveyance of property to ‘trustees who thus became,
according to the law of Jersey, the owners of the [property]’ in the Privy
Council, where the Royal Court of Jersey had earlier found that diﬀerent
persons ‘had between them, the one in law [en droit], the other in equity [en
équité], entire possession of the [trust property].’81 Similarly, in Guernsey,
‘[a] trust exists if a person (a “trustee”) holds or has vested in him, or is
deemed to hold or have vested in him, property which does not form or which
has ceased to form part of his own estate’ for another person or purpose—
interestingly, ‘purpose’ is deﬁned as including the ‘holding or ownership of
property’, which is not ordinarily regarded as a purpose of a trust in itself.82
Again, the treatment of the trustee’s powers admits the notion of ‘beneﬁcial
ownership’: ‘[s]ubject to the provisions of this Law and to the terms of the
trust, a trustee has, in relation to the trust property, all the powers of a
beneﬁcial owner’;83 and ‘[a] bona ﬁde purchaser for value without notice of
a breach of trust . . . may deal with a trustee in relation to trust property as if
the trustee were the beneﬁcial owner thereof.’84 Thus, similarly to Jersey,
a Guernsey trustee owns property, which is encumbered by the trust and
Guernsey law.85

B. Trusts with Ownership in the Beneﬁciary

In the next grouping of trusts, we ﬁnd similar functionalities, but ownership
in the trust property is in the beneﬁciary and managed by the trustee.86 Such
‘trusts’ are found in the so-called mixed jurisdictions of South Africa and
Louisiana. In the preceding section of this article, it was observed that South
African law accommodates two trusts: one with ownership being in the trustee
(having English heritage); the other with ownership being in the beneﬁciary
(having Dutch ancestry).87 Although the two kinds of South African trusts
have been dealt with separately for present purposes, both trusts are treated as
a ‘single institution’ in South African law with ownership in the beneﬁciary

or the trustee.88 Control by the trustee, rather than ownership, is seen as the
essential feature of a trust and ‘[o]wnership is merely the form such control
most commonly and conveniently takes’.89 Despite enabling settlors to choose
whether the beneﬁciary or the trustee will ‘own’ trust property, ‘the form
in which trusts are in practice overwhelmingly frequently encountered’ is in
the trustee.90 The South African ‘bewind trust’ is, nevertheless, a ‘trust’ with
ownership in the beneﬁciary.

In Louisiana, ‘title’ to trust property is held by the trustee.91 While the
Louisiana Trust Code is silent on who ‘owns’ trust property, and says nothing
of the beneﬁciary having ‘title’ to trust property, ownership of the trust
property is considered to be in the beneﬁciary.92 The prevailing academic view
is also that ‘the “title” of the trustee is merely a power of administration and
disposition rather than ownership’.93 This is perhaps supported by certain
provisions of the Louisiana Trust Code, which provide that a natural person
enjoying ‘full capacity to contract’ can be a trustee, whereas a natural person,
corporation, partnership or other legal entity having the ‘capacity to receive
property’ can be a beneﬁciary—the combined eﬀect of which reﬂects the
distinct roles of trustee and beneﬁciary, as administrator and owner of the
trust property, respectively.94 But curiosities arise with other provisions of
the Louisiana Trust Code on that view. From the beneﬁciary’s perspective,
a person can become a beneﬁciary of a trust in Louisiana without knowledge
or notice of the existence of the trust;95 additions to the trust property can
be made simply with the approval of the trustee;96 and a beneﬁciary may refuse
an interest at any time after creation of the trust, which refusal operates
retroactively, such that it is considered that the beneﬁciary never received
any interest in the trust or the trust property.97 The combined force of these
provisions is such that a person is regarded the owner of trust property, even
though they are unaware of the trust or the property the subject of the trust.

Fiduciary Ownership and Trusts in a Comparative Perspective

915

Furthermore, if a beneﬁciary disclaims their status under a Louisiana trust,
the beneﬁciary is not regarded as the owner of trust property retrospectively,
even though that person was deemed to be the owner of the trust property
before that time.98 In retrospect, the location of ‘ownership’ is anomalous after
disclaimer by the beneﬁciary as it is unclear who is to be regarded as the owner
of the trust property, even though the trustee held ‘title’ to the trust property
during the life of the trust. Indeed, a trustee of a Louisianan trust must: ‘take,
keep control of, and preserve the trust property’; keep trust property separate
from their own property and other property not subject to the trust; and deliver
trust property to those entitled at the expiration of the trust or the trustee’s
involvement.99 If the trustee is not the owner of the trust property, how can the
trustee perform these functions? Again, although ‘title’ to the trust property
is transferred to the trustee, ‘ownership’ is strained in order to say that the
beneﬁciary is the ‘owner’, rather than conceptualizing an encumbered form of
ownership in the trustee (ie ‘ﬁduciary ownership’), which would chime better
with the statutory deﬁnition of ‘trust’.100

C. Trusts with Ownership Remaining in the Settlor

In China, ‘ownership’ is similarly strained in such a way that ownership is
reserved in the settlor of a Chinese trust.101 Under the Chinese Trust Law, ‘trust
refers to that the settler, based on his faith in trustee, entrusts his property rights
to the trustee and allows the trustee to, according to the will of the settler and in
the name of the trustee, administer or dispose of such property in the interest of
a beneﬁciary or for any intended purposes’.102 The idea that the settlor reserves
ownership of trust property is perhaps supported by certain provisions of the
Chinese Trust Law providing for the segregation of trust property from other
property of the settlor and empowering the trustee to ‘entrust’ another to handle
trust business—if the latter ‘entrust’ does not convey ownership to a third party
then the initial entrusting by a settlor ought not convey ownership to a trustee
either, if ‘entrust’ has a consistent meaning.103 However, other provisions raise

some oddities with this reading. First, the trustee’s power to administer
and dispose of property ‘in the name of the trustee’ is diﬃcult to reconcile with
the idea that ownership of the trust property remains with the settlor.104
Secondly, the requirement that certain trust property be segregated from other
trust property provides that, if the settlor is a co-beneﬁciary and the settlor’s
legal existence ends, then the ‘trust shall subsist’, with the settlor’s right
to beneﬁt from the trust being his legacy or liquidation property.105 If such a
settlor remains the owner of the trust property, this gives rise to the absurdity
that a person who dies, is dissolved or cancelled according to law, or is
declared bankrupt, can and must continue to own trust property for the life of a
Chinese trust.106 Thirdly, Article 16 of the Chinese Trust Law, which provides
for the segregation of trust property from other property owned by the trustee,
would be superﬂuous if the settlor remains owner of the trust property.107
Fourthly, it is curious that a trustee must ‘at regular intervals each year, report
to the settlor and beneﬁciary on the administration and disposition of the
trust property’.108 Thus, the Chinese settlor, who is supposedly the owner of
the trust property, does not know between reporting intervals what property
he ‘owns’ and may be told after the fact that he has been divested of all or part
of that property. Again, a strained interpretation of ownership arises in the
Chinese trust, with ownership being in the settlor, rather than any ﬁduciary
ownership in the trustee, even though the broad term ‘entrusts’ in Article 2
of
the Chinese Trust Law supports that conclusion and avoids those
ambiguities.109

D. Trusts without Owners: Suspended Ownership and

Free-Floating Patrimony

The conceptual framework for this ownership structure is largely attributable to
Lepaulle, who believed that the true essence of the trust was the ‘segregation of
trust property from the patrimonium of individuals, and the devotion of such
assets to a certain function, a certain end’.110 In isolation, those statements
are reasonably apt to describe the organizational structure of trusts—that is,
the ﬁduciary oﬃce of trusteeship. However, Lepaulle took this notion much

further and overstated various aspects of trusts such that if full, unencumbered
ownership cannot be in any of the trust parties ‘the only solution left is
to attribute title to the trust itself’.111 And voilà: patrimoine d’aﬀectation
or ‘patrimony by appropriation’, in which trust property has no owner at
all.112 In Cantin Cumyn’s view, patrimony by appropriation is ‘the logical
consequence of a necessary separation between trustee and title to the property

trusts will continue
irrespective of the existence of any of the trust parties and, therefore, none of

foundation for that argument has been persuasively exposed elsewhere.115
Nevertheless, the reasoning of Lepaulle proved persuasive to Ethiopia, Mexico
and Quebec.116 The structure of Quebec trusts is orientated around speciﬁed
purposes and the appropriation of a trust patrimony to a purpose.117 While
‘title’ to the trust property in a Quebec trust is in the name of the trustee,118
‘the trust patrimony . . . is autonomous and distinct from that of the settlor,
trustee or beneﬁciary and in which none of them has any real right’.119
Further, ‘[t]he trust is the owner of the property included in the patrimony’ and
‘[b]eneﬁciaries have no title or right in the property of the trust’.120

The current approach to ‘title’ in the Quebec trust (or ﬁducie) diﬀers from the
old ﬁducie that existed prior to recodiﬁcation in 1994, in which the Supreme
Court of Canada surveyed multiple approaches to ownership, whereby diﬀerent
trust parties were considered owners of the trust property, and through a
process of elimination held that, due to ‘title’ being in the trustee in the Quebec
trust, ownership was vested in the trustee.121 Similarly, despite the ‘dedicated
fund’ logic being accepted in Mexico in 1932, the Mexican courts later held
that ownership of the trust property must still be in someone and that someone
was the trustee.122 It has been said that the logic of patrimony by appropriation
in the Quebec trust ‘circumvents the pitfalls of dual ownership, numerus
clausus and other such real or imagined impediments’,123 but at what cost
to conceptual clarity? The notion that no one owns trust property for the life of
a Quebec trust, despite title to such property being vested in the trustee for that
time, is a curious result. It seems strained to say that trust property has no

nature of ownership in which title to property is held for the fulﬁlment of
a purpose (ie ﬁduciary ownership).124

E. Trusts with Ownership in Any of the Trust Parties

(at the Election of the Settlor)

This grouping of trusts relies on the private international law enforcement and
recognition of foreign trusts in domestic law. Italy was one of the ﬁrst three
States, together with Luxembourg and the Netherlands, to sign the Hague
Trusts Convention and was the second country to ratify the Convention.125
Following ratiﬁcation, Lupoi developed the concept of the trust interno,
in which entirely domestic trusts—having Italian settlors,
trustees and
beneﬁciaries and comprising Italian assets—can be governed by foreign law
at the election of the settlor.126 The trust interno is not merely an academic
vision, but has found considerable judicial support in Italy, according to Braun
and Lupoi.127 The only foreign element of the trust interno is the applicable
law, which the Italian settlor has chosen to import when establishing the trust.
Although it may be doubtful whether this was intended when the Hague Trusts
Convention was drafted,128 this interpretation ﬁnds fairly ﬁrm footing on
a plain reading of Articles 6 and 8 of the Hague Trusts Convention, which
provide that ‘[a] trust shall be governed by the law chosen by the settlor’
and that law ‘shall govern the validity of the trust, its construction, its eﬀects,
and the administration of the trust’. Assuming the law chosen by the settlor
provides for trusts or the category of trust involved, settlors have a very broad
discretion to choose the applicable law to govern the trust.129 Thus, ‘Italian
citizens are allowed to set up trusts entirely based in Italy but governed by
a foreign law chosen by the settlor in absolute freedom.’130 Although the
Hague Trusts Convention contains provisions to lessen the settlor’s discretion
as to the choice of law, those provisions have been neutralized by States when
enacting domestic law to give eﬀect to the Hague Trusts Convention.131

Italy is not the only State to have been swayed by the notion underlying the
trust interno. Switzerland is also amenable to the concept of the trust interno.
Although Switzerland ratiﬁed the Hague Trusts Convention in 2007, it did
not take advantage of the opt-out provision, which permits States the freedom

not to ‘recognise a trust the signiﬁcant elements of which, except for the choice
of the applicable law, the place of administration and the habitual residence
of the trustee, are more closely connected with States which do not have the
institution of the trust or the category of trust involved’.132 Instead of making
that escape clause available to allow Swiss courts not to recognize trusts,
the settlor’s choice of law applies where ‘under art 13, the State is not obliged
to recognize a trust’.133 This gives Swiss settlors a broad empowerment in
the choice of law to govern Swiss trusts. In Braun’s view, ‘unlike Italy,
Switzerland has decided not to transpose article 13 of the [Hague Trusts
Convention] . . . Hence, Swiss judges will not be able to deny the recognition
of a trust interno on the basis of article 13’.134 A peculiar situation potentially
arises in the United Kingdom, which has ratiﬁed the Hague Trusts Convention,
but also failed to include the non-recognition clause (Article 13), which
potentially gives English settlors the ability to subject their domestic trusts
to foreign law in order to avoid orthodox mandatory rules in English trust
law, such as the prohibition on private purpose trusts, with the English courts
being obliged to enforce the foreign choice of law.135 English settlors have
been cautious thus far. Although, in extreme cases, ‘[t]he provisions of the
Convention may be disregarded when their application would be manifestly
incompatible with public policy (ordre public)’.136

Trusts created pursuant to the Hague Trusts Convention are diﬃcult to
characterize from an ownership perspective where ‘trust’ refers to ‘the legal
relationships created when . . . assets have been placed under the control of a
trustee for the beneﬁt of a beneﬁciary or for a speciﬁed purpose’ and includes
the following characteristics: ‘the assets constitute a separate fund and are not a
part of the trustee’s own estate’; ‘title to the trust assets stands in the name of
the trustee or in the name of another person on behalf of the trustee’. Although
the deﬁnition of ‘trust’ only refers to ‘control’ of assets being in the trustee—a
rather loose deﬁnition that has drawn criticism137—the characteristics of the
trust are more narrowly drawn and point to ﬁduciary ownership of trust
property being in the trustee. Again, like many civil law trusts considered
thus far, title is in the name of the trustee or an authorized nominee. Mindful of
the comparative study of ownership in trusts undertaken in this article, which
has shown that ‘ownership’ moves around considerably in civil law trusts,
‘ownership’ could conceivably be in any of the trust parties or in none of
them, depending on the settlor’s choice of law. One would expect, however,

that settlors would choose a recognized trust jurisdiction as the applicable law
to govern trust administration with ﬁduciary ownership and title in the trustee
accordingly (eg England, Guernsey or Jersey).

F. The Indivisibility of ‘Ownership’ and the Outright Rejection of ‘Trusts’

traditional Continental civil

Despite permutations of the trust ﬁnding broad acceptance in many mixed
legal systems,
law systems have been more
reluctant to embrace ‘trusts’. In the Netherlands, the future of trusts looked
reasonably bright in the early twentieth century with a burgeoning form of
‘ﬁduciary ownership’.138 In 1929, the Dutch Supreme Court aﬃrmed the
validity of this new ownership structure in a case involving the well-known
beer company, Heineken, in which the complete inventory of a bar had been
notionally transferred to Heineken for securitization purposes without the loss
of possession of those assets, allowing the owner of the bar to continue running
the business.139 Although this pragmatic solution was not part of the Dutch law
of pledges and was not mentioned in the Dutch Civil Code, the Supreme Court
of the Netherlands recognized ‘ﬁduciary ownership’ sui generis.140 The notion
of ‘ﬁduciary ownership’ in Dutch law signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced English law
by means of the so-called ‘Romalpa clause’, which was drafted in a contract
for the supply of aluminium foil by a Dutch company, Aluminium Industrie
BV (AIV), to an English partnership that was later transferred to an English
company, Romalpa Aluminium Ltd (Romalpa). Two interesting features of the
original Romalpa clause was that it allowed AIV to retain ownership over
property it supplied to Romalpa unless and until payment had been received
from Romalpa and that Romalpa became the ‘ﬁduciary owner’ of any property
that was made from, mixed with or constituted by AIV’s property. Initially
drafted in Dutch, the contract was expressly agreed to be governed by Dutch
law, with exclusive jurisdiction being conferred upon the Amsterdam court
and the contract deposited with the district courts in the Netherlands.141
Although there was no evidence before the court in relation to Dutch law, and
particularly whether the Dutch courts would have enforced such a clause, the
retention of title was enforced by the English Court of Appeal. The Romalpa
clause, with its Dutch origins, has had a profound inﬂuence on commercial
law in the common law tradition.142

Despite the fertile ground for the growth of trusts having been sown in
the Netherlands in the early twentieth century with the notion of ‘ﬁduciary
ownership’, the ﬁeld was rendered barren in 1947 when Professor Meijers was
assigned the task of drafting a new Dutch civil code. Meijers was an outspoken

antagonist of the trust, especially ownership in trusts. ‘The English notion that,
he who manages property for the beneﬁt of another and has the right to dispose
of that property qualiﬁes as the legal owner, is without a doubt inferior to our
view that the person for whose beneﬁt the property is being administered is the
exclusive owner of that property’, Meijers declared.143 In 1954, Meijers
completed a framework for the new code and died a few months later. His
vision was nevertheless realized over the following 40 years, culminating in
1992.144 The new Dutch Civil Code contains provisions that seem designed to
repel the reception of the trust by invalidating any transfers of property that do
not convey full ownership on the transferee and prohibiting the recovery of
property from assets available to creditors upon the bankruptcy of a would-be
‘trustee’.145 Of course, one should be careful not to administer a prophylactic
that is worse than the aﬄiction. In this vein, Wibier has provocatively asked
whether a modern legal system can do without the trust?146 Wibier considers
that the Dutch legal system has proved remarkably adaptive and intuitive in
dealing with trust-like scenarios on a case-by-case basis and that there is no
reason to expect that this will not continue.147 Whether conventional trust fact
patterns ought to be dealt with in an ad hoc manner is debatable, as a fully-
functional law of trusts would provide a greater degree of certainty and accord
with the civilian persuasion of codiﬁcation. Furthermore, a fully-functional
theory of ownership with ‘ﬁduciary ownership’ might better explain existing
legal institutions in the Netherlands in more coherent, neutral terms.

Recent European law reform projects have attempted to develop a uniform
set of principles to govern ‘trusts’ and to introduce the notion that the trustee
is the owner of trust property, albeit encumbered by the trust. Indeed, the
Principles of European Trust Law exclude all ‘trusts’ in which ‘the assets are
not owned by the trustees.’148 Thus, art 1(1) of those Principles states, ‘[i]n
a trust, a person called the “trustee” owns assets segregated from his private
patrimony and must deal with those assets (the “trust fund”) for the beneﬁt of
another person called the “beneﬁciary” or for the furtherance of a purpose.’149
Ownership of trust property by the trustee is considered ‘fundamental to
a trust’ and, further, ‘a trust cannot exist without a fund owned by a trustee.’150
Another
recent uniﬁcation project adheres broadly to the notion that
‘ownership’ and ‘title’ to trust property must be in the trustee. In Book X of
the Draft Common Frame of Reference (on ‘Trusts’) one of the ‘indispensable
elements of the trust concept’ is that a ‘trustee [is] the owner or right-holder

in whom title to the trust fund is vested’. In relation to the indispensable
‘trustee’, the drafters state:151

An essential feature of a trust is that title to the trust fund is vested in the trustee.
For the purposes of performing the trust the trustee is cloaked in the mantle of an
outright owner. It is the ability of the trustee to dispose of the fund (derived from
that title) which distinguishes a trust from other relationships in which assets are
placed under the control of a non-owner – for example, the relationship arising
from a contract for storage.

Whilst ambitious, there is much to commend these attempts to develop a
uniform set of principles concerning trusts at a European level, especially in
view of the ambiguous manner in which ownership and title are dealt with in
civil law trusts elsewhere, and also to strengthen the European common
market.152 Whilst there is scope for civil law institutions to emulate some of the
functionalities of trusts, a diﬃculty is encountered when trusts are equated with
contracts. Trusts are not contracts, even if extended for the beneﬁt of a third
party.153 Notably, contracts fail to accommodate the proprietary eﬀects that
trusts have on third parties.154 Furthermore, there is no contractual counterpart
to the broad supervisory jurisdiction over trust administration that is exercised
by the court to ensure that trusts are lawfully performed. As such, ‘trust-like
devices’ that take the form of hyper-extended contracts and fall short in
the proprietary department are unlikely to be as attractive as common law
trusts.155 Rather than expect that a European trust will be embraced across
Europe in the near future, though, it is perhaps more likely that civil law
systems on the Continent will continue to adapt more familiar
legal
institutions, such as ﬁducia,156 which has recently undergone recodiﬁcation
in France,157 Luxembourg,158 Romania159 and traces of which still exist in
the Netherlands.160 But not all civilian jurisdictions will look pragmatically
toward trusts to develop their own home-grown institutions, as Waters
observed ‘others like Germany are hostile to [the trust] as a potential cuckoo
in the nest’.161

is,

A number of functional analyses have been undertaken with a view to
identifying ‘trust-like devices’ in Germany and elsewhere—that
legal
institutions in non-trust jurisdictions, principally civil law systems, which
could in some practical sense be described as a trust. In Germany,
the
comparison is principally made between the treuhand and the trust.162 One
must be careful not
to overstate the ‘functional equivalence’ of such
institutions on the basis of such comparisons between them. Simply because
some institution can, at a high level of abstraction, permit one person to hold
property for the beneﬁt of another does not mean that it is equivalent to a
‘trust’ in a meaningful sense—that would be to oversimplify the trust as a
fundamental legal institution in the common law tradition and the manner in
which it is regarded as a matter of law in trust jurisdictions—for example,
having regard to the supervisory jurisdiction over trust administration. It is
informative to see, however, the manner in which some recent institutions
emulate trusts. A good example of this is found in the security ﬁducie in
France, which Barrière has described as ‘a variety of title-based security’ that
involves the transfer of property from one person to another, each of whom is
broadly described as ‘settlor’ and ‘trustee’ respectively, for the fulﬁlment of a
particular purpose, and which plainly does not involve absolute ownership
of the property in the sense of art 544 of the French Civil Code, but rather
‘ﬁduciary ownership’.163

G. Trusts with Independent Legal Personality That Own Property

Returning to the common law tradition, we ﬁnd that one of the cardinal rules in
trust law is occasionally broken by statutory draftsmen: a trust does not possess
distinct legal personality that enables it to own property independent of the
trustee nor, for that matter, can a trust sue or be sued in its own right.164
Nevertheless, the ﬁnal permutation of ownership is for a trust to be established
as a separate legal entity, so that it can own property. A notable example of this
kind of ‘trust’ is found in the Uniform Statutory Trust Entity Act 2009 (US),
which provides in the Prefatory Note that, in contrast to a ‘common law trust’,
‘a statutory trust is a juridical entity, separate from its trustees and beneﬁcial
owners, that has capacity to sue and be sued, own property, and transact in its
own name.’165 Thus, section 307 of that Act provides, ‘[a] statutory trust may
hold or take title to property in its own name, or in the name of a trustee in the

trustee’s capacity as trustee, whether in an active, passive, or custodial
capacity.’ The Comment to that section is also revealing. It states: ‘[b]y
providing that a statutory trust may transact and hold property in its own name,
this section implements the concept that a statutory trust is an entity separate
from its trustees and beneﬁcial owners. The property of a common-law trust,
by contrast, must be held in the name of the trustee in the trustee’s ﬁduciary
capacity.’166 Although that description acknowledges ﬁduciary ownership
in trusts as an orthodox rule in trusts law, this statutory trust creates another
permutation of ownership of trust property—that is, the notion of a trust having
a separate legal personality and attributing ownership to that artiﬁcial
person.167 Again,
legal
persons—in Maitland’s words, a trust is an ‘unincorporate body’, quite distinct
from a corporation (aggregate or sole).168 In accordance with the present
methodology, whether such a ‘trust’ ought to be regarded as a trust properly
so-called or some other entity (eg a corporation) will not be further considered,
even though that institution is potentially mislabelled.169

this violates the cardinal rule that

trusts are not

IV. FUTURE PERSPECTIVES ON FIDUCIARY OWNERSHIP IN TRUSTS

Having undertaken a comparative study of ownership in various ‘trusts’ in the
broader civil and common law traditions and shown the diverse ways in which
ownership is conceptualized in ‘trusts’—with ownership potentially being in
any of the trust parties or none of them—we can return to the root cause of the
ambiguity. ‘Ownership’ is a diﬃcult term to master in English law and in
the common law tradition. In the common law, the full sense of ownership of
land is expressed by the clunky phrase of ‘fee simple absolute in possession’,
which uniﬁes a number of constituent elements that can be encumbered and
fragmented. For example, A might be regarded as the ‘owner’ of land situated
in England (‘Blackacre’), despite a mortgage over Blackacre in favour of B,
a lease of a house on Blackacre in favour of C, a proﬁt-à-prendre in favour of
D to cut down and remove trees on another part of Blackacre, an easement
across Blackacre in favour of E, a restrictive covenant not to run a business
on the land and public rights of way to the world at large. Despite all of this,
A might proudly declare himself to be the ‘owner’ of Blackacre. The situation
is further complicated by Blackacre being settled on trust with the income
arising therefrom to F for life and the remainder to G. This situation reﬂects

a ‘market-based, client-driven approach (where the client
is the original
megalomaniac owner of all the rights in the thing, who wished to do lots of
diﬀerent things, and beneﬁt diﬀerent people in diﬀerent ways).’170 Even though
calls have for a long time been made to the eﬀect that ‘[t]he technical basis of
the law of ownership should be restated in terms of actual fact’,171 it is diﬃcult
to synthesize ‘actual fact’ in this ﬁeld in order to sensibly reform ownership.
Nevertheless, attempts ought to be made to do so as there is no logical or
rational basis underlying the ambiguity in the status quo. At the very least, such
attempts stimulate debate and assist in providing further clarity.

As a general legal construct, the concept of ‘ownership’ has the content that
we choose to ascribe to it in law and legal theory. As ‘merely a convenient
ﬁgure of speech’,172 ownership operates at a higher level of abstraction than the
complex aggregate of legal relations that comprise ownership. For that reason,
ownership will diﬀer according to the circumstances and will not have a precise
or static meaning divorced from a particular proprietary context. Nevertheless,
it retains value as a useful shorthand description that indicates the person with a
present, superior claim over property.173 The comparative study of ownership
in trusts in this article has shown that the term ‘title’ introduces signiﬁcant
ambiguity as to who is regarded the owner of trust property, even though title
is commonly recorded in the name of the trustee. As Fox observed, ‘[t]he
deﬁnition of “title” is elusive since the sense in which the word is used varies
with the context. Sometimes it is used in a very loose sense as a synonym for
ownership.’174 The sense in which ‘title’ is here delineated from ‘ownership’ is
a conventional one, as being prima facie proof of ownership. ‘Title: the
evidence of a person’s right to property’ is a close approximation, even though
‘right to property’ is inexact and undeﬁned.175 Turning then to title in a trust
context, the traditional rule in English law is that trust property must be
and remain under the control of the trustees and, where there are two or more
trustees, ‘title’ to the trust property must be vested in their names jointly.176

Co-trustees will be liable for a breach of trust if they allow trust property
to be vested in the name of one trustee or to be controlled by a third party and
thereafter lost.177

Despite the strained interpretation of ‘title’ that is applied across diﬀerent
civilian jurisdictions, as not being synonymous with ‘ownership’, ‘title’ is
frequently recorded in the name of a trustee. This evidences a convergence of
some form of ownership of trust property in the trustee, if we treat ‘title’ as
being prima facie proof of ownership. Indeed, eﬃcient trust administration
commonly requires that a trustee has the powers associated with ‘title’ and that
the trustee or the trustee’s authorized agent is able to deal with trust property,
especially in the case of the complex management of trust property. Joint
delegation of speciﬁc functions to agents, custodians and nominees furthers
diligent and prudent trust administration, with such arrangements reviewed
periodically by the trustees. If a trustee has title to trust property, which is an
important practical requirement for the ﬂuid administration of trust property,
‘ownership’ inevitably gravitates toward the trustee—such is the importance
of having title vested in a person and held in their name because a function of
title is that title itself represents who is the owner of the relevant property, at
least in some capacity. As the present study has shown, ‘title’ to trust property
is in the name of the trustee in China, Louisiana and Quebec, but ownership of
the trust property is said to be in the settlor, beneﬁciary and in none of the trust
parties, respectively. This begs the question of why all of these ownership
permutations in civil law trusts are to be preferred over a unique conception
of ownership that better reﬂects the encumbered nature of ownership when
‘title’ is vested in a trustee. As Honoré observed, ‘[t]o [civilian lawyers] the
title to a thing prima facie entails ownership of it and ownership carries with it
the implication of a beneﬁcial interest in the asset, even if not coupled
with present enjoyment of it’.178 Another way to approach the problem might
be to say that title ought still carry with it
the prima facie implication
of ownership, but a closer analysis may reveal the speciﬁc, encumbered
form of ownership if that
title attaches to trust property (ie ‘ﬁduciary
ownership’); therefore, title need not carry any further implication of beneﬁcial
enjoyment. If left unchecked, permutations of ‘ownership’ in the broader civil
law tradition have the potential to cause further confusion going forward and
risk certain ‘trusts’ not being recognized as ‘trusts’ properly so-called in other
jurisdictions when it comes to enforcing those ‘trusts’ under the Hague Trusts
Convention. In order to accommodate ‘trusts’, and also to better explain how
domestic legal arrangements in civil law systems already challenge the unitary
conception of ‘ownership’, the civil law is in need of a new modality of
ownership.179

Fiduciary Ownership and Trusts in a Comparative Perspective

927

Apart from recasting ‘ownership’ where title to property is vested in the
trustee, a more diﬃcult situation arises in determining where the description of
ﬁduciary ownership ﬁts a particular civilian legal arrangement. Categorization
of particular legal arrangements must be a question of law, quite irrespective
of the label attached by a person in purportedly settling a ‘trust’ or even by
a legislator in codifying a ‘trust’, at least in comparative trust law and for the
purposes of private international law.180 For some leading jurists, the location
of ‘ownership’ is determinative of whether diﬀerent civil law ‘trusts’ are really
trusts at all.181 On this basis, one pre-eminent work excludes the Quebec ‘trust’
( ﬁducie) and the South African ‘bewind trust’ due to trust property not being
owned by the trustee.182 Although there is no common law claim to the use of
the word ‘trust’ nor copyright in that term,183 the mere attachment of the
word ‘trust’ to a legal arrangement does not make that arrangement a trust as
a matter of law in the common law tradition nor does it, by extension to
comparative trust law, command that a particular arrangement is functionally-
equivalent to a trust.184 A diﬃcult task confronting comparative trust lawyers is
in determining what legal arrangements are trusts properly so-called, which can
be enforced as trusts internationally under the Hague Trusts Convention,
despite its somewhat vague deﬁnition. If, for example, the Chinese trust,
with ‘ownership’ in the ‘settlor’ and management powers in the ‘trustee’, and
the South African bewind ‘trust’, with ‘ownership’ in the beneﬁciary and
management powers in the ‘trustee’, are ‘trusts’ properly so-called under the
Hague Trusts Convention, this gives rise to the unintended result that other
private law institutions, especially agency, may be ‘trusts’ in comparative trust
law or private international law and enforceable under the Hague Trusts
Convention.185 Thus, recognizing all ‘trust-like devices’ as trusts may general-
ize the concept so much as to the leave the very concept of a trust amorphous
or ‘shapeless’.186

Turning back to the common law, the notion that concurrent ownership
exists in trusts in the common law tradition is misleading and mistaken.187

is relatively successful, compared with the Hague Agency Convention (with only four signatories

general unwillingness of States, especially in the common law tradition, to recognize and enforce
agency relationships internationally. That same reticence is not present in the case of trusts, though.

The dualistic conception of ownership in trusts, including the beneﬁciary’s
‘equitable ownership’ of trust property, has caused confusion in comparative
trust discourse for some time.188 Beyond misleading, the dualistic conception
of ownership is mistaken because the incidents of ownership are not neatly
divided when ‘one person administers and another person or object beneﬁts
from the property’.189 To take a few of Honoré’s incidents of ownership,
neither the trustee nor the beneﬁciary may have rights to possess or use trust
property, if the terms of the trust dictate that the property must be leased to a
suitable third party, with the income derived therefrom accumulating until
some later time. By extension, the beneﬁciary may have no present entitlement
to receive capital or income from the trust. These are not features that are
essential to the existence of a trust, but may be the subject of the settlor’s intent
in shaping the trust and will not be overridden by any notion that
the
beneﬁciary must have certain rights (ie present entitlements) to beneﬁt or
enjoy trust property.190 Thus, it is not essential that the beneﬁciaries have
the ‘complex bundle of beneﬁcial relations which may be called ownership’.191
It is equally misleading to speak of trusts comprising any kind of ‘split
ownership’, as though the genius behind the trust is in the fracturing of the
incidents of full, unencumbered ownership, or in any concurrent ownership
existing at Common Law and in Equity.192 As Maitland observed, ‘Equity did
not say that the cestui que trust was the owner of the land, it said that the trustee
was the owner of the land, but added that he was bound to hold the land for
the beneﬁt of the cestui que trust.’193 By extension of Maitland’s logic, trustees
are accountable for the administration of trust property and it is of little use
for a trustee to proclaim his status as the ‘legal owner’ of that property in order
to obfuscate accountability in trust administration as a matter of law.194 As
Rudden said, ‘[t]he orthodox explanation, given in terms of the traditional
distinction between law and equity, provides only an historical and not
a rational account of the trust’.195 There is no need for any conceptualization
of the beneﬁciary as being the owner of trust property in order to give a rational
account of trusts and delineate trusts from other private law categories
(eg agency).

A further reason for a reconceptualization of ownership in trusts in the
common law tradition is that the traditional explanation of ownership in trusts
dictating that ‘title’ must be ‘in the trustee’ is outmoded and largely redundant.
In modern times, trust property is commonly held by one person—usually

a company incorporated for that purpose—and managed by others, which
protects the trust property from the vicissitudes of natural persons, including
bankruptcy, divorce and succession. The separation of the holding and
management functions alleviates the ongoing need for title documents to be
continually altered and vesting orders to be made in those common scenarios.
Not only has the traditional view of joint ownership been relaxed by trust-
drafting in terms of one trustee being nominated as a custodian or nominee of
the trust property in whom title is registered, that position has also been altered
by statute in order to allow normal market dealings and to enable trustees
to appoint, and vest trust property in, certain authorized persons, such as
custodians and nominees.196 The vesting of trust property in a ‘custodian’,
‘nominee’ or only one of the trustees relaxes the rule that all trustees must
‘own’ trust property jointly and further undermines the dual and split
ownership metaphors in trusts that assume joint ownership. In custodian
trusteeship, for example, ‘title to trust property is vested in the custodian
trustees, but the powers of management remain in the ordinary trustees . . .
Strictly speaking, in such a case, the ordinary trustees are not trustees at all;
they lack one of the four elements of a trust, since no trust property is vested
in them.’197 Although ﬁduciary ownership of trust property with title being
vested in the trustee is the prevailing ownership structure in comparative trusts
law, the orthodox English position has moved closer to the essential feature of
trusts being the ﬁduciary administration of trust property, rather than adhering
to a dogmatic rule that title must remain jointly in the trustees at all times
during trust administration.198 Practical developments shown by custodian
trustees and nominees underscore the importance of developing an auton-
omous conception of ﬁduciary ownership that can be abstracted from the strict
notion that title must be held in the name of every trustee and better reﬂects the
reality of modern trust administration. As such, it is an appropriate time for
the theory regarding ownership in trusts to adapt to reﬂect contemporary trusts
practice.

A description of ownership in a trust context

that better reﬂects the
encumbered nature of trust property would further the objective of conceptual
clarity in comparative trust law. ‘Fiduciary ownership’ does not rely on any
postulation of split or divided ownership, which imply that every trustee jointly
and severally owns trust property and is simply not true of a large number of
modern trusts in which one person—usually a custodian, nominee or ‘trust
company’—is designated as the person in whom ‘title’ to the trust property is
held. Trusts involve the ﬁduciary administration of property for the fulﬁlment

of an ascertainable purpose. The inextricable link between ownership and
property is such that, unless we abandon ‘ownership’ taxonomy altogether,
there must be a form of ‘ownership’ that describes the encumbered nature of
property that is the subject of trust administration. The perceived diﬃculty, as
Gretton observed, is that ‘a system-neutral language is both necessary and
impossible’.199 ‘Ownership’ is, however, only useful as a general concept in
its ability to explain and order legal thought. For that reason, we might say
that trusts so challenge the concept of ‘ownership’ that the concept ought to
be discarded.200 But that would run away from, rather than confront, the
conceptual problem in this modality of ownership and destabilize the general
concept.201 In one sense, it also might be seen to support Lepaulle’s notion
underlying the Quebec trust
that ownership is suspended during trust
administration. Furthermore, ownership derivatives—‘own’, ‘owner’, ‘own-
ing’, etc—are not only entrenched in comparative trusts discourse, but in the
general and statutory law applicable to trusts in many jurisdictions. For that
reason alone, a better account must be given of ownership in trusts. In any
event, moving away from the language of ‘ownership’ would only serve to
shift the attention to ‘title’, which would likely be a distinction without
a diﬀerence. As such, unless there is another solution to the ambiguity
concerning the nature of ownership in trusts that surpasses the logic of
ﬁduciary ownership, despite not being anchored in the safe harbour of
ﬁduciary loyalty, or the ‘dual’ or ‘split’ ownership metaphors can otherwise
be justiﬁed, which it has been argued they cannot, ‘ﬁduciary ownership’ is
the preferred term to express the ownership structure of a trust in the civil and
common law traditions.

In a general sense, ﬁduciary ownership exists whenever title is held by a
person in respect of property that is designated for a purpose protected by law.
In a trust context, the best shorthand description of the encumbered nature of
trust property is found in the succinct phraseology of ‘ﬁduciary ownership’.202
The vesting of title to trust property in a person constitutes that person as the
owner of that property, which is the function of ‘title’, but only in that person’s
(ﬁduciary) capacity as trustee and subject to the duties that person owes by
virtue of that status in the general and statutory law as permissibly altered by
the terms of the trust. In Hohfeldian terms, duties are necessarily attached to the
powers of a trustee, quite irrespective of whether a trustee is regarded as having
all the powers of a ‘beneﬁcial owner’ by virtue of trust-drafting or any

applicable legislation. It is this coupling of duties with powers that is at the
heart of a trust and is the essence of ‘ﬁduciary ownership’.203 Hence, adding
‘ﬁduciary’ to the word ‘ownership’ serves as an indicator that the relevant
property is held for the fulﬁlment of a purpose protected by law and triggers
further enquiry as to the extent and nature of the encumbrance in the particular
circumstances. Fiduciary ownership better communicates the encumbered
nature of trust property than the dual or split ownership metaphors in the
common law tradition and highlights the essential interplay between ﬁduciary
loyalty and trusteeship.204 The move to ﬁduciary ownership in trusts also
shifts comparative trusts discourse beyond the impasse of other owner-
ship metaphors, thereby removing a perceived barrier to the reception or
transplantation of trusts in the broader civil law tradition and alleviating the
further fragmentation of ownership in civil law trusts.205

VI. CONCLUSION

‘trusts’

The trust was traditionally seen as the exemplar of incommensurability in
comparative law. However, as the present study has shown, it is possible to
cross diﬀerent legal traditions and compare diﬀerent legal institutions by
moving beyond linguistic barriers and juridical diﬀerences in order to contrast
the ownership structures in diﬀerent
internationally. One must,
however, tread carefully: commensurability is not synonymous with equival-
ence. The conﬂation of the two concepts would be a grave error in logic. The
diversity of species within the ‘trust’ genus is so great that it would be a bold
claim to say that all of the trusts encountered in this article are ‘functionally
equivalent’, albeit ‘doctrinally diﬀerent’.206 The claim by a legislature to have
a ‘trust’ in a particular civilian jurisdiction does not, ipso facto, demonstrate
that such a trust performs the same functions as trusts in other jurisdictions nor
that ‘civil law trusts’ do not conﬂict with underlying civilian assumptions and
doctrines. Similarly, the introduction of statutory trusts in jurisdictions within
the common law tradition that possess separate legal personality and enable
such trusts to own property require further explanation of how those ‘trusts’
ﬁt within some coherent classiﬁcation of legal institutions, especially in terms
of how those ‘trusts’ diﬀer from corporations and why they are not simply
a species of corporation. As such, trusts highlight the importance of developing
a coherent classiﬁcation of legal institutions and the characteristics used to
distinguish one institution from another. ‘Ownership’ is a useful lens through
which to view those diﬀerent institutions.

The many and varied approaches to ownership in trusts that have been
taken in the broader civil law tradition are indicative of an underlying tension
in transplanting trusts in the civil law and the eﬀect such transplantation has
on the traditional civilian conception of ownership. In any event, what does it
matter if there is such internal conﬂict? Change must occur within the civil law
tradition as it does in any other tradition over time.207 Although a number of
civilian legal codes were, naturally, a product of the systematic rationality that
so deﬁned the Age of Reason and the Enlightenment,208 Continental legal
philosophy has since exposed the fallibility of the ‘perfect author’ and this
alone would seem a suﬃcient justiﬁcation for this conclusion.209 It may well be
that these doctrinal variations within the civil law tradition may cause greater
fracturing over time in the tradition as a whole—that is, a kind of butterﬂy
eﬀect 210—unless a more coherent and consistent approach is taken. There does
not appear to be any underlying logic to justify the diverse approaches to
ownership in civil law trusts nor the ongoing fragmentation of the concept of
ownership in the civil law tradition that has been caused by diﬀerent persons
being regarded as the ‘owner’ of trust property in those ‘trusts’ in order to
avoid perceived problems with dual or split ownership.

A more coherent and consistent approach to the encumbered nature of
trust property in the common law tradition, as well as the broader civil law
tradition, is to be found in the further development of the notion of ‘ﬁduciary
ownership’. To that end, ambitious, European-wide projects designed to
develop a coherent set of essential principles and mandatory rules for trusts
are to be welcomed. However,
insofar as ownership is concerned, such
ambitious projects ought to further the notion of ‘ﬁduciary ownership’, rather
than perpetuate the mistaken and misleading metaphors of dual or split
ownership in trusts or that a trustee is mysteriously ‘cloaked in the mantle of an
outright owner’. Absent some attempt to create a coherent set of principles
to apply to trusts in the civil law tradition, especially as regards ﬁduciary
ownership of trust property, only time will tell how the divergent approaches to
ownership in civil law trusts will aﬀect the civil law as a distinct legal
tradition.211 In 1928, Lepaulle said, ‘[i]f [the civilian jurist] tries to grasp [the
trust concept in the common law], he will confront the same disappointing
experience as that of the young Prince who runs after a Fairy: when he is on the
point of reaching her, she has taken another form, ceases to be a beautiful lady,
but has become a white bird, or an old witch!’212 A return to doctrinal analyses
