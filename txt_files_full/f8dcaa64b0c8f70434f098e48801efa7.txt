Logic and Thought

1. Logic formalizes the “Laws of Thought” [Boole, 1854]
2. We do not think logically since logic is hard to learn and

we make errors

Logic and Thought

(cid:73) The rules of logic come from somewhere: They can be

thought of as attempts to formalize thinking

(cid:73) Everyone will agree that classical logic is reasonable if the

whole setting is accepted

(cid:73) Does logic apply to everyday reasoning?
(cid:73) Do we prefer plausibility over logical validity?
(cid:73) Can we explain away errors by processing limitations,

misunderstandings, pragmatic factors, etc.?

(cid:73) Is there a competence-performance distinction?
(cid:73) Does logic deal with how we should reason and

psychology how we do (normative vs descriptive)?

(cid:73) Do we reason by a non-classical logic?
(cid:73) What is the relation between formal logic and everyday

reasoning?

Everyday Inferences

“Person A asks: Where’s the university?
Person B replies: Some of those people are from there.
Person A goes up to the group of people indicated by B and
asks them the same question.”

“The ability to reason [...] lies at the heart of human
mentality: Homo sapiens is a rational creature, and there are
many occasions in life that call for inferential skills.”

[Johnson-Laird, 1983, p. 23]

Logical Puzzles

People do “logic” (constraint satisfaction problems) for fun!

Wason Selection Task: Fruitﬂy of Reasoning

Below is depicted a set of four cards, of which you can see
only the exposed face but not the hidden back. On each card,
there is a number on one of its sides and a letter on the other.
Also below there is a rule which applies only to the four cards.
Your task is to decide which if any of these four cards you
must turn in order to decide if the rule is true. Don’t turn
unnecessary cards. Tick the cards you want to turn.

Rule: If there is a vowel on one side, then there is an even
number on the other side.

This is very basic propositional logic. Why is it so hard?

Cards: City on one side, means of transportation on the other.
Every card is one trip that I made.

Claim: Every time I go to Manchester I travel by car1

[Griggs and Cox, 1982]

Pragmatic Reasoning Schemas

(cid:73) Idea: We have diﬀerent reasoning schemas (aka logics) that apply

to diﬀerent scenarios

(cid:73) Example 1: “If two particles have like electrical charges, then they
repel each other”, in a physics class modus tollens is appropriate
(cid:73) Example 2: “If I have a headache, then I should take an aspirin”,

modus tollens is useless

(cid:73) Example 3: “If you do that again, you will be grounded”, how

surprised would you be if you were grounded even though you didn’t
do anything?

(cid:73) Candidates for pragmatic reasoning schemas for if-then are:

Permissions, obligations, causations

(cid:73) For each situation we need to decide—based on the context and

our knowledge—which reasoning schemas are appropriate

(cid:73) Abstract versions of Wason’s task or concrete versions that don’t

provide enough context are hard since we don’t know which logic to
reason with

[Cheng and Holyoak, 1985]

Pragmatic Reasoning Schemas

You are an immigration oﬃcer at the International Airport in
Manila, capital of the Philippines. Among the documents you
have to check is a sheet called Form H. One side of this form
indicates whether the passenger is entering the country or in
transit, while the other side of the form lists names of [tropical
diseases] [inoculations the passenger had had in the last 6
months. This is to ensure that entering passengers are
protected against the disease]. You have to make sure that if
the form says ’ENTERING’ on one side, then the other side
includes cholera among the list of diseases.

ENTERING

TRANSIT

cholera
typhoid
hepatitis

typhoid

[Cheng and Holyoak, 1985]

Abstract Permissions

Suppose you are an authority checking whether or not people
are obeying certain regulations. The regulations all have the
general form, “If one is to take action A, then one must ﬁrst
satisfy precondition P.” In other words, in order to be
permitted to do A, one must ﬁrst satisfy precondition P.

Performance in this task is high compared to the classic card
problem.

[Cheng and Holyoak, 1985]

Factual vs Deontic

Rule 1: If there is a vowel on one side, then there is an even
number on the other side.
Rule 2: If a person is drinking beer, then the person must be
over 19 years of age.

(cid:73) Rule 1 and 2 are not of the same form: One is factual

and the other deontic

(cid:73) A factual rule describes the state of aﬀairs: If there are

no counterexamples the sentence is true

(cid:73) A deontic rule does not have a truth value: It is in place
irrespective of whether someone violates the rule or not

[Stenning and van Lambalgen, 2004]

The 2-Rule Version

U

I

8

3

If there is a U on one side, then there is an 8 on the other side
If there is an I on one side, then there is an 8 on the other side
One of the two rules is true and the other false

[Stenning and van Lambalgen, 2004]

The 2-Rule Version

U

If there is a U on one side, then there is an 8 on the other side

U∨I

If there is an I on one side, then there is an 8 on the other side

3∨8

One of the two rules is true and the other false
⇒You should only turn the 3.

[Stenning and van Lambalgen, 2004]

What Is Truth?

“I wouldn’t look at this one [3] because it wouldn’t give me
appropriate information about the rules; it would only tell me
if those rules are wrong, and I am being asked which of those
rules is the correct one. Does that make sense?”

Is not-false the same as true? In classical logic it is. But you
can also reason non-classically.

And in a three-valued logic:

∧ f
f

?
t

[Stenning and van Lambalgen, 2004]

Cards as a Sample from a Larger Domain

(cid:73) Instructions say explicitly: “below there is a rule which

applies only to the four cards”

(cid:73) Non-classical, three-valued reasoning would make sense if
you assume that the rule has to be true for all cards of a
larger domain (say a whole stack) and not just the four
samples that you got

(cid:73) In this case seeing a counterexample falsiﬁes the rule but
not seeing any counterexamples does not mean that the
rule is true in general

(cid:73) This is a more natural interpretation of the word “rule”: A
rule that just applies to four instances is not really a rule

[Stenning and van Lambalgen, 2004]

What Is the Domain of Discourse?

(cid:73) An inﬁnite domain of potential cards?
(cid:73) A stack of cards?
(cid:73) Only the four cards in front of the S? (This is the

interpretation intended by E)

(cid:73) Each card independently? (“Truth of the card”)

[Stenning and van Lambalgen, 2004]

“Truth of the Card”

1. If there is a U on one side, then there is an 8 on the other

side

2. If there is an I on one side, then there is an 8 on the other

side

3. One of the two rules is true and the other false

U

I

8

3

“E. If you found an 8 on this card [I], what would it say? S. It
would say that rule two is true, and if the two cannot be true
then rule one is wrong...”
Interpretation: Either rule 1 or 2 applies to each card, hence if
rule 1 is true of one card it is true of all (note that I/8 satisﬁes
1 and 2)

[Stenning and van Lambalgen, 2004]

Rules and Exceptions

“S. [Turns 3 and ﬁnds U] OK ... well no ... well that could be
an exception you see. E. The U? S. The U could be an
exception to the other rule. [...] E. You’d have to look at the
other ones? S. Yes.”

(cid:73) What if the Ss interpret the rule as a rule with exceptions?
(cid:73) This is clearly a reasonable reading of everyday statements

[Stenning and van Lambalgen, 2004]

What Is Falsity?

“E. So you’re saying that if the statement is true, then the
number [on the back of A] will be 4... What would happen if
the statement were false? S. Then it would be a number other
than 4.”

(cid:73) What if p → q is false?
(cid:73) Classically: p ∧¬q is true
(cid:73) Common interpretation (strong falsity): p → ¬q is true
(cid:73) Example: What is the negation of “If he goes to

Amsterdam, he will get stoned”?

[Stenning and van Lambalgen, 2004]

Reasoning and Planning

“E. Same for the I, what if there is an 8 on the back? S. If
there is an 8 on the back, then it means that rule two is right
and rule one is wrong. E. So do we turn over the I or not? S.
Yes. Unless I’ve turned the U already.”

(cid:73) Presentation suggests that you can turn cards
(cid:73) But you have to do the task without ﬁnding out about

the backs

(cid:73) In the standard Wason task: If I start with the p-card and
I ﬁnd ¬q I’ll be done and don’t have to look at any other
cards

[Stenning and van Lambalgen, 2004]

The Meaning of If

(cid:73) Ss read if p then q as p ↔ q (“If you do that again, you

will be grounded”)

(cid:73) Ss read if p then q as p ∧ q (>50% paraphrase the

instructions in this way)

Rule: If there is a vowel on one side, then there is an even
number on the other side.

(cid:73) Under the conjunctive reading you don’t need to turn any

cards

(cid:73) Ss reinterpretation: Check which cards satisfy the rule

[Stenning and van Lambalgen, 2004]

An Aside: Counterfactuals

(cid:73) We often use if in counterfactuals (“If you hadn’t done

this, that wouldn’t have happened”)

(cid:73) Counterfactuals clearly behave diﬀerently from material

implication

(cid:73) “If I were David Bowie then I would have been in the

movie Labyrinth”

(cid:73) “If I were David Bowie then I would not have been in the

movie Labyrinth”

(cid:73) “If 1+1=3 then 1+1=2” (If this was a material

implication it would be true)

Wason Selection Task

(cid:73) Wason’s selection task is the fruitﬂy of reasoning research
(cid:73) This simple task is surprisingly diﬃcult to understand
(cid:73) For subjects and experimenters alike
(cid:73) There is no doubt that people make mistakes in reasoning

even if they use the right reasoning schema

(cid:73) The problem seems to lie in inferring from context and

knowledge which reasoning schema is appropriate

(cid:73) Distinguish between [Stenning and van Lambalgen, 2004]

(cid:73) Reasoning from an interpretation
(cid:73) Reasoning for an interpretation

Rules vs Models

(cid:73) Logic as the laws of thought seems to suggest that we

reason in a formal calculus

(cid:73) Simple example: “All men are mortal”, “Socrates is a

man” therefore “Socrates is mortal”

(cid:73) One way to arrive at this conclusion is by applying an

abstract rule: p → q,p therefore q

(cid:73) No doubt that we can do this, in fact, you learn how to

do this correctly in your logic class

(cid:73) Alternative view: You construct a model and reason from

the model (also formal processes!), e.g., using Euler
circles or Venn diagrams

(cid:73) What is the representation that Ss use? Can it explain

competence and performance?

Syllogistic Reasoning

Syllogisms are deductions based on two premises. Each
premise and conclusion is in one of four forms:

(cid:73) All X are Y
(cid:73) Some X are Y
(cid:73) No X are Y
(cid:73) Some X are not Y

All X are Y
All X are Z
∴Some Y are Z

[Johnson-Laird, 1983, chapter 4]

Syllogistic Reasoning

Some of the artists are barkeepers
All of the barkeepers are chemists
∴?

All of the bankers are athletes
None of the councilors are bankers
∴?

[Johnson-Laird, 1983, chapter 4]

Syllogistic Reasoning

All of the bankers are athletes
None of the councilors are bankers
∴?

1. Some of the athletes are not councilors
2. Some of the councilors are not athletes
3. None of the athletes is a councilor
4. None of the councilors is an athlete
5. There is no valid conclusion of interest

Mental Models

(cid:73) The premises of diﬀerent syllogisms are consistent with

varying numbers of models

(cid:73) The diﬃculty of syllogistic reasoning is a function of the
number of mental models you have to construct to come
to a valid conclusion (percent valid inferences):

one model

two models

three models

46%
20%
20%

92%
80%
62%

Experiment 1
Experiment 2
Experiment 3

27%
9%
3%
(cid:73) The idea of reasoning by constructing mental models
generalizes to other reasoning tasks (e.g., the Wason
selection task) and other forms of representations (e.g.,
images)

[Johnson-Laird, 1983, chapter 5]

Beyond Deduction

(cid:73) Deduction: Reason from premises to valid conclusions
(cid:73) All men are mortal, Socrates is a man, therefore he is

mortal

(cid:73) Induction: Reason from premises to plausible conclusions

(in particular to general rules)

(cid:73) I’ve seen 42 black ravens and guess that all ravens are

black

(cid:73) Abduction: Give a plausible explanation of an event

(cid:73) The grass is wet hence it is likely that it rained during

the night

Wason’s other task

“You will be given three numbers which conform to a simple
rule that I have in mind. This rule is concerned with a relation
between any three numbers and not with their absolute
magnitude, i.e. it is not a rule like all numbers above (or
below) 50, etc. Your aim is to discover this rule by writing
down sets of three numbers, together with reasons for your
choice of them. After you have written down each set, I shall
tell you whether your numbers conform to the rule or not, and
you can make a note of this outcome on the record sheet
provided. There is no time limit but you should try to discover
this rule by citing the minimum sets of numbers. Remember
that your aim is not simply to ﬁnd numbers which conform to
the rule, but to discover the rule itself. [...]”

2 4 6 conforms to the rule...

[Wason, 1960]

Summary

(cid:73) Logic traditionally seeks a normative theory of reasoning
(cid:73) Cognitive science seeks also a descriptive theory of

reasoning (that may be logical, too)

(cid:73) There is a diﬀerence between competence and

performance

(cid:73) Wason’s selection task is the fruitﬂy of reasoning research
(cid:73) Choosing a reasoning schema for a given situation is hard
(cid:73) Mental models theory assumes that we construct a model

of the situation that we want to reason about

(cid:73) Problems in reasoning stem from the number of models

that are consistent with the premises

Recommended Thinking

(cid:73) Solve a Sudoku puzzle. Which inference rules do you use? Think aloud.
(cid:73) Open up a random page in your favorite novel. Read a paragraph and try to
explicitly ﬁll in all the premises and inferences that you have to do in order to
understand what you are reading. How do you know to whom or what the
pronouns refer to?

(cid:73) What is the relationship between rationality and logic?
(cid:73) Spock or Kirk? Do emotions play any role in everyday reasoning? Should they?
(cid:73) Three gods A, R, and C are called, in some order, True, False, and Random.

True always speaks truly, False always speaks falsely, but whether Random
speaks truly or falsely is a completely random matter. Your task is to determine
the identities of A, R, and C by asking three yes-no questions; each question
must be put to exactly one god. The gods understand English, but will answer
all questions in their own language, in which the words for “yes” and “no” are
“da” and “ja,” in some order. You do not know which word means which.
[Boolos, 1996]

(cid:73) Clariﬁcations: It could be that some god gets asked more than one question
(and hence that some god is not asked any question at all). What the second
question is, and to which god it is put, may depend on the answer to the ﬁrst
question. (And of course similarly for the third question). Whether Random
speaks truly or not should be thought of as depending on the ﬂip of a coin
hidden in his brain: if the coin comes down heads, he speaks truly; if tails,
falsely. Random will answer da or ja when asked any yes-no question.
[Boolos, 1996]

Recommended Reading

Johnson-Laird has a recent pop science book that I can recommend
[Johnson-Laird, 2008]. I ﬁnd it a little long and some chapters are more interesting
than others but it is also useful as a general intro to cognitive science and issues of
representation. In addition, the book covers some of the aspects that we will get to in
the next two lectures: Judgment and problem solving. The main thrust of the book
comes from Johnson-Laird’s own theory: Mental models. If you are into logic and
want to see what role logic can still play in cognitive science, it’s worthwhile to have a
look at Human Reasoning and Cognitive Science [Stenning and van Lambalgen, 2008],
although the book is a bit rough for beginners. Chapters 3 and 4 follow closely the
paper that I followed in the lecture [Stenning and van Lambalgen, 2004]. The other
chapters in Part I and the last chapter of the book are an interesting description of the
relationship between logic and human reasoning. Chapter 10 also covers syllogisms
and a logical reconstruction of Johnson-Laird’s mental models. Most cognitive
psychology textbooks cover syllogistic reasoning and the Wason selection task.
