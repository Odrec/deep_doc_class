Holocene climate changes and warm man-made refugia may explain
why a sixth of British butterflies possess unnatural early-successional
habitats

Analyses of their habitats indicate that  18% of British  butterfly
species  are  restricted  to  the earliest  serai  stages of  ecosystems,
whereas  the  same  species  occupy  later  serai  stages  in  central
Europe,  where  spring  and  summer  temperatures  are  warmer.
The  microclimates  of  their  British  habitats  are  exceptionally
warm, compensating  for the cooler climate.  Most of these Brit-
ish habitats are also ephemeral, and have long depended on man
for  their  creation  and  regeneration  This  poses  the  question  of
where  these  species  lived  before  man  created  their  habitats,
roughly  6000  BP,  I  suggest  that  they  are  relics  from  a  period
when  British  summers  were  warmer  than  today,  and that they
avoided  extinction  when  the  climate  cooled  hy  moving  into
warm  refugia  created  hy  prehistoric  man  within  three  types of
ecosystem  If summer temperatures become warmer, these spe-
cies should  return  to  later  serai  stages that  are commoner  and
less dependent  on man.

Introduction
Most  of  the  55 non-migratory  species of  butterfly  that
breed  in  Britain  have  abrupt  northern  limits  to  their
ranges  which  correlate  closely  with  summer  isotherms
(Dennis  1977, Heath  et  al  1984, Dennis  and  Wilhams
1986, Turner  et  al  1987)  Within  these  ranges, c  80%
ot  species  live  in  predominantly  closed  populations,
each  restricted  m its  local  distribution  by the  distribu-
tion of Its larval foodplant(s)  (Thomas  1984)  However,
few  species  occupy  more  than  a  small  fraction  of  the
sites  that  fulfil  these  basic  requirements  (Heath  et  al
1984, Thomas  1984)  Research  on  43% of  Bntish  but-
terfly  species has shown that, with three exceptions, this
IS because temales are selective during oviposition, and
restrict  egglaying  to foodplants  of  a particular  growth-
form  or micro-habitat,  species are confined  to localities
where plants of the required growth-forms exist m suffi-
cient  abundance,  and  continuity,  for  a  population  to
survive  (Thomas  1991)

The  narrowest  and  most  ephemeral  niches  recorded
among  Bntish  butterflies  belong  to  the  10  (18%  of)
species that  breed near the ground  in the earliest  stages
of  seres  (Thomas  1991)  Grassland  examples  include
Macuhnea anon  L  (which is an obligate parasite of the
ant  Myrmtca sabulett Meinert)  (Thomas  1991), Lxsan-
dra bellargus Rott  (Thomas  1983), Hesperta comma L
(Thomas  et  al  1986), Melitaea  ctnxta L  (Thomas  and
Simcox  1982, Thomas  1991) and  Htpparchta semele  L
(Heath  et  al  1984)  Boloria euphrosyne L ,  B  selene
Denis  & Schiff  , Argynnts adippe Denis  & Schiff  and
Mellicta athalta Rott  also  breed  in  the  earliest  serai
stages of  British  grassland,  but  most  populations  occur
in  recent  woodland  clearings  (Warren  1987a,  Warren
and Thomas  1992)  At the northern limit of its range, on
Welsh  heathland,  Plebejus  argus  L 
is  restncted  to
patches where the vegetation  has been burnt or cleared
in the previous five  years (Thomas, C  D  1983, 1985)
The ephemeral  British habitats of seven of these spe-
cies  depend  entirely  on  man  for  their  regeneration,
whereas  a  minority  of  populations  of  P  argus and H
semele also breed in "natural" pnmary habitats, such as
dunes and undercliffs,  Melitaea ctnxta is wholly depend-
ent on the  latter  in Britain  (Heath  et  al  1984, Thomas
1991)  This  IS no  recent  phenomenon  since  reeords
began,  most  or  all  populations  of  these  species  (apart
from  M  cinxta) bred  on  land  that  was being  managed
by the traditional  methods that  have prevailed  on  Brit-
ish heaths, grasslands and woods from  roughly 6000 BP
until  the  present  century  (Harris  1766,  Barrett  1893,
Heath  et al  1984, Thomas  1984,  1991, Rackham  1986,
Warren  and  Key  1991)  indeed,  it  is because  modern
forms of management have reduced both the abundance
and continuity of early serai stages within all three eco-
systems,  that  there  have  been  exceptionally  severe  re-
cent  declines  of  the  nine  species  that  inhabit  them
(Heath  et  al  1984)  populations  typically  survive  2-10
