Abstract
This  article  surveys  recent  data  and  empirical  literature  on  (trends  in)  unionization  and  its 
determinants  in  advanced  countries.  There  are  some  robust  stylized  facts,  for  instance  that 
unionization is positively related to public sector employment, establishment size, and the business 
cycle. Union-administered unemployment insurance and union presence at the workplace also 
play a positive role. However, some seemingly obvious explanations for union decline – such as 
economic globalization and changes in economic structure and workforce composition – do not 
seem to have impeded union membership everywhere; nor has the decentralization of collective 
bargaining.  It  also  remains  an  open  question  whether  changes  in  social  values  and  employee 
attitudes towards unions have affected unionization negatively.

Introduction
In the 20th century, trade unions became important labour market and political actors in 
most industrialized countries. In the 21st century, however, some observers argue that 
‘organised labour seems heading for extinction’ (The Economist, 21 September 2006). 
Since  unions’  existence  and  influence  depend  on  their  ability  to  attract  and  nurture  a 
loyal  membership,  it  is  important  to  know  which  factors  determine  the  extent  and 
stability of unionization.

Although the economic, sociological and political science literature contains a rea-
sonable amount of theoretical and empirical work on unions and their membership, rela-
tively few stylized facts have emerged and some of these are not so stylized and robust 
at all. In particular, some popular perceptions – for example, that union decline is ubiq-
uitous, that unions cannot adjust to structural changes in the economy, that some groups
