Matlab for Cognitive Science

Homework #1

Please turn in your homework in your group folder on Friday Oct 31st. The docu-
ment needs to contain your name(s), matriculation number(s) as well as your Mat-
Lab code and all required ﬁgures.

Task : Compute a Orientation Tuning Curve

1. Get the ﬁle Extracellular_Recording_trials_1.mat from Stud.IP.

Load the data into MatLab.

• In this data matrix you’ll ﬁnd recordings of the response of one neuron in
V1. 8 different bars with a speciﬁc orientation were shown; meanwhile
the activity of the neuron was recorded (see ﬁgure A). The orientations
are equally spaced and range from 0° to 157.5°. Each recording contains
100 samples over the time intervall of 1000ms in 10 trials. 1 represents
the occurrence of a spike at this sample, while 0 indicates that no spike
has occcurred.

• The ﬁrst dimension of the matrix corresponds to the different orienta-
tions, the second dimension to trials and the third dimension is the ac-
tivity
