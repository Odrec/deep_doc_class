Abstract

Defining the mutational landscape when individuals of a species grow separately and diverge over many generations can
provide insights into trait evolution. A specific example of this involves studying changes associated with domestication
where different lines of the same wild stock have been cultivated independently in different standard environments. Whole
genome sequence comparison of such lines permits estimation of mutation rates, inference of genes’ ancestral states and
ancestry of existing strains, and correction of sequencing errors in genome databases. Here we study domestication of the
C. elegans Bristol strain as a model, and report the genome sequence of LSJ1 (Bristol), a sibling of the standard C. elegans
reference wild type N2 (Bristol). The LSJ1 and N2 lines were cultivated separately from shortly after the Bristol strain was
isolated until methods to freeze C. elegans were developed. We find that during this time the two strains have accumulated
1208 genetic differences. We describe phenotypic variation between N2 and LSJ1 in the rate at which embryos develop, the
rate of production of eggs, the maturity of eggs at laying, and feeding behavior, all the result of post-isolation changes. We
infer the ancestral alleles in the original Bristol
isolate and highlight 2038 likely sequencing errors in the original N2
reference genome sequence. Many of these changes modify genome annotation. Our study provides a starting point to
further investigate genotype-phenotype association and offers insights into the process of selection as a result of laboratory
domestication.

Introduction

Selective breeding during domestication can lead to rapid and
dramatic changes in phenotype [1]. Understanding domestication
is important both because it can link phenotypic selection with
genetic change, and because it has been central to human success
[2,3]. Laboratory strains of model organisms are unusual examples
of domestication in which extensive inbreeding has maximized
phenotypic uniformity and artificial selection has been used to
improve laboratory handling [4–6]. Inbred lab strains often
exhibit significant phenotypic differences from wild isolates of the
same species. For example, olfactory responses of lab strains of
Drosophila differ from those of recently caught wild strains [7]. Lab-
adapted mouse strains show reduced exploratory behavior [8],
agility and strength [9], and risk aversion [10] compared to wild
caught mice. However, the consequences of laboratory domesti-
cation have not been systematically investigated in any animal.

laboratory studies of

With a few exceptions [11–16],

the
nematode C. elegans have used the same wild type reference strain:
N2 (Bristol). The progenitor of this strain was collected in Bristol,
England, sometime before 1956 by L.N. Staniland [17,18]. E.
Dougherty took its descendants to California, where two stocks of
the strain were maintained from 1956 by serial transfer, one in
axenic liquid culture and the other on nutrient agar inoculated

with E. coli [17]. In 1964, Dougherty sent Sydney Brenner at the
MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology one of these C. elegans sub-
strains. Brenner used this
stock to establish the laboratory
reference C. elegans wild strain, which he called N2 (Bristol). At
the MRC, N2 was maintained on agar plates with an E. coli food
source until c. 1970, when the strain was frozen (Figure 1a).

The sibling stock of the Bristol isolate that was cultivated in
axenic liquid culture appears to have also survived, and is called
LSJ1(Berkeley) [16]. Here we refer to it as LSJ1(Bristol) to indicate
its origins. Distinct growth conditions and inadvertent selective
breeding are likely to have exposed the N2 and LSJ1 sub-cultures
to different selective pressures. Additionally, both strains likely
experienced genetic bottlenecks, with associated founder affects,
prior to freezing. Comparing the genomes of N2 and LSJ1 Bristol
strains would highlight genetic changes associated with lab
domestication as well as errors in the C. elegans reference genome.
The ancestral and derived alleles at each polymorphic locus could
also be established by comparing the genomes of Bristol-derived
strains and of other wild C. elegans isolates.

One striking difference between N2 and most other wild C.
elegans isolates is in foraging [11]. N2 feeds alone, whereas most
wild isolates feed in groups [11,15]. Dimorphism in foraging is
associated with two alleles of the neuropeptide receptor npr-1 that
differ at codon 215. Aggregating strains encode the ancestral npr-1

wild isolates that are genetically closely related to N2 also show
solitary behavior and encode npr-1 215V, which would be
consistent with recent occurrence of the polymorphism in wild

populations. Surprisingly however, the LSJ1 strain feeds in groups
and encodes the npr-1 215F allele, which would suggest that the
npr-1 215V allele arose during laboratory domestication of N2
[13,20]. These conflicting data suggest two hypotheses: that the 12

years are all cases of switched strain identities or of strain cross-
contamination, and are in fact N2 (Bristol)-derived; alternatively,

genome sequencing of LSJ1 provides an opportunity to distinguish
between these hypotheses.

the C.

Illumina sequencing has been successfully used in C. elegans both
to sequence a wild isolate [21] and to identify lesions in mutants
isolated in genetic screens [22]. Here we report the sequence of the
LSJ1 (Bristol) strain and compare it to the reference N2 (Bristol)
genome sequence. We confirm that LSJ1 and N2 are derived from
the same Bristol
isolate. We identify only 3246 predicted
differences between the LSJ1 and N2 genome sequences. Of
these changes, 2038 are likely errors in the original N2 sequence,
since we find the LSJ1 allele in N2 strains; correcting them alters

annotation of
polymorphisms arose in either the N2 or the LSJ1 lineages during
lab domestication. By sequencing two recently isolated wild C.
elegans strains, CB4856 (Hawaii) and ED3054 (Kenya), we infer the
ancestral state of the original Bristol
isolate. Alleles that arose
during domestication include at least 88 changes that alter protein
sequences. Side-by-side comparison of N2 and LSJ1 strains reveals
significant phenotypic differences: N2 animals develop more
quickly, lay eggs at a faster rate, lay eggs that have reached later
developmental stages, and forage differently from LSJ1 animals.
For one trait, aggregation/dispersal on food, our data suggest that
standard laboratory C. elegans husbandry selects strongly for the
allele found in the N2 domesticated strain. For another, the stage
at which eggs are laid, we map N2/LSJ1 phenotypic variation to
two regions on C. elegans chromosome V. Our work sets the scene
for using C. elegans as a model for studying animal domestication.
Additionally, the sequence differences we highlight between the
N2 reference genome and LSJ1 provide a first pass filter to screen
out false positives when using Next Generation Sequencing to
identify induced mutations.

Results

Comparing the LSJ1(Bristol) genome with the N2(Bristol)
reference sequence

To examine how the C. elegans Bristol wild isolate has evolved
during laboratory cultivation we sequenced the LSJ1 strain of this
isolate using Illumina technology. To minimize sequencing bias we
omitted PCR amplification steps in making our genome libraries
[23]. We targeted an average library insert size of 200 bp, which
we sequenced at both ends. From four sequencing lanes, two each
with 54 bp and 76 bp reads, we obtained an average of 79.94-fold
coverage of the LSJ1 genome. The average per-lane yield of LSJ1
sequence was 1.45 Gb using 54 bp reads and 2.57 Gb using 76 bp
reads, corresponding to 14.206 and 25.116 coverage of the C.
elegans genome, respectively. Alignment
to the N2 reference
genome (release WS203) [24] showed that over 99% of positions
in the genome were covered by this sequence. The remaining
positions represented repeat DNA or regions of low-complexity
sequence. Thus a single Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx flow cell
lane was sufficient to obtain .20 fold coverage of the C. elegans
genome when using 76 bp reads. Raw sequence data for LSJ1, as
well as for the wild strains ED3054 and CB4856, which were used
as outgroups in this study, is available in the NCBI Short Read
Archive (Accession number SRA024308).

The N2 and LSJ1 strains were genetically very similar: we
identified 1425 potential single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
between them, and 1821 small (1–3 bp) insertions and deletions
(indels) (Tables S1 and S2). Small indels can be difficult to identify

Domestication of C. elegans

using Illumina data, so we sequenced a subset of 67 indels, with a
variety of alignment quality scores, using traditional Sanger
sequencing. We found that Sanger sequencing confirmed almost
all (38/40) indels that were called unambiguously by the BWA
alignment program, and those called ambiguously were almost
never (2/27) confirmed. We therefore filtered our small indel data
for only unambiguously called indels. We also found 31 larger
deletions (between 5 and 297bp) and 10 larger insertions (between
5 and 33bp) (Table S3).

The changes we identified were expected to include both
genuine variation between the N2 and LSJ1 genomes and
sequencing errors in the N2 reference sequence or in our Illumina
data. Errors would be flagged as N2/LSJ1 polymorphisms in our
comparison. To examine how frequently this occurred, we verified
a small subset of the N2/LSJ1 polymorphisms by traditional
Sanger sequencing. We chose 12 SNPs and 12 indels and
sequenced them in both the LSJ1 strain and in our lab’s N2
(Bristol) stock. The N2 stock we used was one of the earliest N2
samples frozen at the MRC. All LSJ1 sequences confirmed the
data obtained by Illumina sequencing. Interestingly, however, for
many of the polymorphisms (9 of 12 SNPs and 10 of 12 indels) the
N2 strain in our lab had the LSJ1 and not the N2 allelic variant.
This suggested that many apparent polymorphisms between the
LSJ1 and N2 sequences represent errors in the reference sequence.
Alternatively,
the strains of N2 sequenced by the genome
consortium had accumulated many more mutations than our N2
stock.

Illumina sequence data of LSJ1 and different N2 stocks
permits the N2 reference sequence to be updated

Since many putative N2/LSJ1 polymorphisms in our small test
sample validated as LSJ1 alleles in our N2 strain, we extended our
study across the genome using new N2 sequencing data. The
original N2 reference sequence was obtained from DNA cloned in
cosmid, phage and YAC libraries [24], but stocks of the N2 strains
used to generate these libraries are not available. We therefore
examined new Illumina sequence data from six other N2-derived
strains obtained from 3 labs (we thank S. Nurrish, B. Olofsson and
W. Schafer for the sequence). Specifically, we found that for 548 of
the 1425 predicted N2/LSJ1 SNPs, at least 4 of the 6 N2 strains
encoded the LSJ1 allele. Similarly, 1490 of 1821 indels occurred as
LSJ1 alleles in at least 4 of the 6 N2 strains (Table S1). Note that
because we do not have the original sequencing traces for the six
N2 Illumina genome sequences, we cannot ascertain whether N2
strains that do not show the LSJ1 sequence at the positions shown
in Table S1 actually have the N2 allele or have poor sequencing
coverage at
these
unconfirmed N2/LSJ1 polymorphisms are likely to be errors in
the C. elegans reference sequence. This is not surprising: the C.
elegans sequencing consortium predicted an error rate of less than 1
in 10,000 bp. Our data suggest an actual error rate in the region of
1 in 50,000 bp. The alternative hypothesis, that the N2 strains
sequenced by the consortium had diverged substantially from
currently used N2 strains is less likely for the bulk of the changes.
Mutation accumulation studies suggest an average mutation rate
of 2.761029 per base pair per generation for the C. elegans genome
[25]. This would predict accumulation of only 27 SNPs across the
N2 genome over 100 generations of continuous lab cultivation.
Fewer generations are likely to separate the N2 strains sequenced
by the consortium and in this study.

have a range of effects on coding predictions, including frameshifts
and exon skipping. Of the 159 exonic indels, 14 occurred in genes
currently annotated in WormBase as pseudogenes, but that in
reality, based on our data, may be functional (Table 1).

The number and distribution of genetic changes
between N2 and LSJ1 is consistent with their expected
degree of separation during domestication

Once we eliminated presumed N2 reference sequence errors,
we identified 1208 differences between N2 and LSJ1, comprising
877 SNPs and 331 indels (Table S2). These polymorphisms were
distributed uniformly among the six C. elegans chromosomes, with a
slight enrichment on chromosome III (Figure 1b). The density of
polymorphisms across each chromosome was also fairly uniform –
chromosomes III, IV and V showed slight enrichment
for
polymorphisms on the chromosome arms (K-S test, p values
corrected using FDR). This pattern recapitulates that observed in
mutation accumulation studies [25], as would be expected for two
strains that diverged in the laboratory. By contrast, polymorphisms
found between N2 and other wild isolates show blocks of highly
polymorphic regions interspersed with regions of low variation,
and substantial enrichment of polymorphisms at the chromosome
arms [26].

By comparing our data to genome-wide mutation accumulation
studies in N2 (Bristol) we could estimate how many generations
separate the N2 and LSJ1 strains. Denver et al estimate a
substitution mutation rate m of 2.761029 per base pair per
generation for the C. elegans N2 genome [25]. Given this value, the
877 SNPs we identified between N2(Bristol) and LSJ1(Bristol)
suggest the two strains were separated 1620 generations ago.
Assuming a 4-day generation time, this translates to about 18
years. The number of generations that LSJ1 and N2 were bred
separately is difficult to estimate, but an 18-year separation is
consistent with the available information about the histories of
these strains.

Inferring the ancestral genotype of the Bristol strain

To infer the ancestral allele present in the original Bristol wild
isolate, we used Illumina technology to determine the genome

Domestication of C. elegans

sequence of two other wild C. elegans isolates: CB4856 (Hawaii) and
ED3054 (Kenya) (variation identified in these two strains, along
with that found in LSJ1, will be available in Wormbase). These
strains provided out-groups for the two Bristol sub-strains: we
reasoned that whichever allele (N2 or LSJ1) was present in both
non-Bristol wild strains was likely to be ancestral in Bristol. For
99% of polymorphisms, CB4856 and ED3054 gave concurring
predictions (Table S2). In 12 cases (0.92%), we found the N2 allele
in one strain and the LSJ1 allele in the other; we annotated such
polymorphisms as having an unknown ancestral state. In total, 719
confirmed changes (59.8%) were found to have the N2 allele and
472 to have the LSJ1 allele (39.3%) as the ancestral state.

The mutational biases observed in mutation accumulation
studies are consistent with base oxidation being a pre-eminent
cause of DNA damage [25]. The N2 and LSJ1 strains were
cultivated under different conditions: N2 on agar in 21% O2, and
LSJ1 in axenic liquid culture that
is typically hypoxic. We
therefore examined if mutational bias in each lineage differed. As
observed in the mutation accumulation lines studied by Denver et
al. we saw enrichment of G:C A:T and G:C T:A mutations (the
type of change expected from oxidative damage) (Figure S2), but
we did not see a decrease in the frequency of these mutations in
the LSJ1 lineage.

Mutation accumulation lines exhibited an average Ts/Tv
(transitions/transversions) ratio of 0.45, with individual line values
ranging from 0.19 to 0.79, which is lower than the ratios of 1.2 to
3.0 observed in wild C. elegans strains [25–29]. We observe a Ts/
Tv rate of 0.74 overall, and 0.67 and 0.84 for ancestral-N2 and
ancestral-LSJ1 changes, respectively (Figure S2). These data
support the hypothesis that transversions are more likely to be
selectively purged in the wild than in the laboratory [25].

Trait variation between N2 and LSJ1 after domestication
Domestication is often associated with accelerated growth and
reproduction. Standard lab husbandry of C. elegans N2 may also
have selected for animals that grow faster and reproduce earlier
than their wild progenitors. This is because animals used to set up
fresh cultures are typically picked from among the first batch of
progeny, which reach adulthood before growing animals exhaust
food. To test this hypothesis we compared the egg-laying profiles

of N2 and LSJ1 animals. The brood sizes of the two strains were
not statistically different (Figure 2a). However whereas N2 animals
that were picked as late L4 larvae laid 96.1% of their brood in two
days, identically staged LSJ1 animals laid only 78.2% of their eggs
during that time, and were still producing many eggs on the third
day after L4 (Figure 2b). Thus N2 animals produce the same
number of eggs as LSJ1 but in a shorter time period, as predicted.
As a measure of developmental rate we monitored the duration
of embryonic development. We dissected N2 and LSJ1 gravid
hermaphrodites and transferred early embryos from both strains to
M9 buffer. Using time-lapse microscopy we recorded images of
embryos every 5 minutes for 10 hours. We then measured the time
it
took for embryos to progress from the comma stage (the
beginning of gastrulation) to hatching, and found that N2 embryos
took an average of 309 minutes, while LSJ1 embryos took 325
minutes (Figure 2c). Thus N2 embryos also develop faster than
their LSJ1 counterparts.

Since C. elegans that grow more slowly often live longer, we also
examined the lifespan of LSJ1. However we found that LSJ1 did
not live significantly longer than N2 (Figure 2d).

We next examined the stage at which LSJ1 lays its eggs by
letting animals lay eggs for one hour and then examining their
developmental stage. We classified embryos into 3 groups: the 8-
cell stage or younger, between the 8- and 16-cell stages, and older
than the 16-cell stage. We found about 50% of LSJ1 eggs were laid
when embryos were younger than the 16 cell stage, whereas less
than 10% of N2 eggs were laid when embryos were at this early
stage (Figure 3a). Whether laying early eggs reflects changes in
egg-production, egg-laying frequency, or both, is unclear.

Using standard genetic mapping methods (see Materials and
Methods) we found that the LSJ1 early egg laying phenotype was
linked to LSJ1 DNA on chromosomes II and V (Figure S3a).
Overall, the phenotype was dominant in an LSJ1 x N2 cross,
(Figure S3b). However genetic dissection using introgressed lines
revealed both a recessive locus or loci on the second chromosome
that had a weak but not significant early egg laying phenotype on
its own (Figure S3c), and a dominant locus or loci on chromosome
V that had a strong early egg laying phenotype (Figure S3c). When
we picked recombinants to map the locus on V we found it did not
map to a single interval, but could be reconstituted in the

transheterozygous F1 progeny of recombinants that had LSJ1
DNA on opposite arms of chromosome V, and N2 DNA at other
genomic locations (Figure S3c). These data suggest that LSJ1
alleles of one or more genes on each arm of chromosome V act
together to generate the early egg laying phenotype. Our genome
sequencing studies have identified a small number of genes in these
two intervals that have coding region changes between N2 and
LSJ1. These include, on the left arm: F53E10.1 (encoding an FeS
cluster protein), T22F3.2 (a ubiquitin carboxyl terminal transfer-
ase), K09D9.12 (function unknown), C18G1.8 (glycosyl transfer-
ase), and on the right arm: str-200 (seven transmembrane receptor)
and M162.7 (currently annotated as a pseudogene). These genes
are good candidates for the loci responsible for the different early/
late egg-laying phenotypes of N2 and LSJ1.

Finally, we examined aggregation, bordering, and oxygen
responses of N2 and LSJ1 animals. As expected given their
genotype at the npr-1 locus [13], LSJ1 animals aggregated and
bordered strongly compared to N2. Nearly 90% of LSJ1 animals
were found at the border of a 2-day lawn of OP50 after 1 hour,
while only 32% of N2 animals were at the border (Figure 3b).
Over a quarter of LSJ1 worms were found in groups of two or

more worms, while less than 5% of N2 animals formed aggregates
(Figure 3b).

C. elegans aggregation partly reflects avoidance of high ambient
O2 [30] [31] [32]. We therefore subjected N2 and LSJ1 animals to
changes in ambient O2 and measured their locomotory responses.
Feeding N2 animals did not significantly alter their speed when
exposed to O2 decreases and moved relatively slowly (Figure 3c). In
contrast, LSJ1 animals exhibited high locomotory activity at 21%
O2 and progressively reduced speed at 19% and 17% oxygen
(Figure 3c). These results recapitulate those observed in an N2 strain
that bears the LSJ1 alleles of glb-5 and npr-1 [15], (Figure 3c). LSJ1
also behaved similarly to a glb-5; npr-1 (N2 background) strain when
exposed to gradual changes in ambient O2 in the absence of food
(Figure 3d). Under these conditions, LSJ1 moved faster than N2 at
21% O2 and reduced its rate of locomotion as O2 fell to 19 and
17%, although not as dramatically as when food was present.

selective pressure for this behavior associated with standard lab
husbandry. To distinguish between these possibilities, we exam-
ined inheritance of aggregation behavior and of the two alleles of
npr-1 in 1000 advanced intercross lines made between N2 and the
aggregating Hawaiian strain CB4856 (Figure 4). After 10
generations of random inter-line matings between 100 different
crosses, each mating plate was used to pick 10 L4 hermaphrodites
that were allowed to self-fertilize on individual plates, creating
1000 lines. Each line was then propagated for a further 9
generations by blindly picking single hermaphrodites to a fresh
plate (Figure 4). At the end of the experiment we genotyped DNA
from each line for npr-1. Out of 978 lines that remained at the end
of the experiment, 841 had the N2 allele of npr-1 (86.1%) whereas
136 animals had the CB4856 allele (13.9%) (Figure 4). By contrast,

chromosome as npr-1 but 20 map units away was 54% CB4856
and 46% N2, and on the autosomes the distribution of CB4856
and N2 DNA was approximately equal. Our data point towards
strong selection for N2 DNA close to npr-1 and relaxed selection
further away from this locus. These data are consistent with
standard lab husbandry of C. elegans strongly selecting for the npr-1
215V allele and solitary feeding behavior.

Discussion

C. elegans is used widely as a model to probe questions in biology.
Most labs use N2 (Bristol) as the reference C. elegans wild strain.
This strain has been maintained in the lab for more than 50 years.
Here we determine the genome sequence of LSJ1(Bristol), a strain
derived from the same wild isolate as N2 but cultivated separately
from it at least since 1964. By comparing the reference N2 genome
sequence to the genome sequences of LSJ1 and of several N2 lab
strains we identify genetic changes associated with domestication
of Bristol and errors in the reference sequence.

We identify 2038 changes between LSJ1 and the N2 reference
sequence that are likely to be sequencing errors, although a few
could be variation between N2 isolates. These changes give an
error rate of only 1 in 50,000 bases in the reference sequence. 206
of the errors we identify localize to exons. Of these, 152 are 1- or
2-bp insertions or deletions: 138 may introduce frameshifts that
substantially change annotated gene structure or
transform
predicted protein-coding genes to predicted pseudogenes. The
remaining 14 small indels map to pseudogenes currently predicted
to produce no protein product. These include genes with
homology to a topoisomerase, a histone-like protein, and a heat
shock protein (Table 1), and correcting these errors may mean that
these genes are predicted to be functional. The remaining 54
exonic errors include single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or
3bp indels that alter, introduce, or remove a single amino acid and
are therefore less likely to drastically change gene predictions than
frameshift-inducing indels. However, 5 such SNPs
introduce
terminator codons in 4 genes (ZK507.1, E02C12.10, sto-5 and
gcy-11, see Table S4), shortening the predicted protein length.
These changes will appear in the C.
elegans online database
WormBase. As genome sequencing becomes increasingly afford-
able, many genomes are being re-sequenced. Our
study
emphasizes the importance of refining genome annotation as
revised sequence information becomes available.

We identified 1208 SNPs and small indels, and 41 larger indels,
between the N2 and LSJ1 strains. Of these, 72 are expected to
cause changes at the protein level (53 SNPs and 19 indels; Table
S5). We also detected 41 larger indels, 7 of which are expected to
affect protein coding (Table S3). The sample size of coding
changes between N2 and LSJ1 is small. Nevertheless, there seems
to be a slight enrichment for cell cycle and metabolic/growth
genes (Table S5). Genes that regulate growth rate and nutrition
have previously been found to be under selection in domesticated
animals [33] [34]. This may also hold true for domesticated
laboratory strains where there is selection for the quickest-growing
animals, and increased nutrient availability as compared to the
wild.

N2 and LSJ1 exhibit phenotypic differences. N2 animals grow
significantly faster than LSJ1 animals and lay their brood more
quickly. In addition, LSJ1 animals lay eggs at earlier stages of
development. Whether these phenotypes result from polymor-
phisms in the same genes or segregate independently is unclear.
However, because the total number of changes between the strains
is so small, it is likely that each phenotypic difference corresponds
to a small number of genetic alterations. Genotyping of domestic

dogs indicates that the wide-ranging phenotypic diversity between
dogs is also generated by just a few genetic changes [3], and this
may be a general feature of traits selected under domestication.
This is true in the case of the C. elegans gene npr-1, where a change
in a single gene leads to dramatic behavioral variation, and for the
early egg laying phenotype that we describe, which seems to be
controlled by just two genes on chromosome V, and possibly by
one or more genes on chromosome II. Such simple genetic
structure of phenotypic variation selected in the laboratory is in
contrast to the genetic structure of natural phenotypic variation.
Natural variation is usually mediated by small-effect changes in
many genes that interact in complex ways [35,36].

We previously showed that the 215F allele of npr-1 is ancestral in
C. elegans, and that npr-1 215V arose recently [19]. The very similar
genomes of N2 and LSJ1, and the fact that these two strains
encode npr-1 215V and npr-1 215F respectively [20] [13] provide
strong evidence that the solitary N2 strain arose from an ancestral
social strain during C. elegans laboratory cultivation. A corollary of
this is that the 12 solitary isolates collected between 1971 and 2003
are inadvertent re-isolates of N2 or N2-derived strains. Our
advanced intercross breeding data suggest strong selection against
npr-1 215F or for npr-1 215V under standard lab husbandry, but
we have not identified which of the constellation of polymorphic
behaviors associated with variation in npr-1 is most important for
selection. npr-1 215V animals fail to burrow into agar plates, and
one possibility is that
these worms are preferentially selected
during strain transfers; another is that solitary worms are more
easily selected than those in groups when transferring worms in
solid culture.

The 1249 genetic differences between the N2 and LSJ1 strains
are distributed evenly across all 6 chromosomes (Figure 1a). These
polymorphisms provide a useful resource for the C.
elegans
community as markers for genetic mapping experiments. Most
mapping experiments currently use the Hawaiian strain CB4856
[37]. However, mapping in the Hawaiian background can be
problematic for some phenotypes due to phenotypic variation
between the CB4856 and N2 strains. The limited number of
polymorphisms between N2 and LSJ1 make this less likely to be a
problem. The resolution from N2 x LSJ1 mapping experiments is
limited due to the low number of polymorphisms between the two
strains (about 1 polymorphism every 85 000 bp). However this
may not be a problem if a rough mapping approach is combined
with whole genome sequencing [22]. As sequencing costs fall,
whole genome sequencing will become increasingly popular as a
method to molecularly characterize C. elegans mutants. Our work
facilitates this approach: the sequence differences we highlight
between the N2 reference genome and LSJ1 provide a first pass
filter to screen out false positives when seeking to identify induced
mutations.

Materials and Methods

Strains

Strains were maintained at 22uC using standard methods unless
otherwise indicated [38]. Strains used in this study are: AX1796
glb-5 (Hawaiian) V; npr-1(g320) X; CB2030 unc-62(e644) dpy-

Briefly, 40 mmoles of adapters were phosphorylated at their 59
end by 1 U/ml T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs)
for 30 minutes at 37uC. The kinase was denatured at 94uC for 2
minutes, and the adapters annealed by cooling to 20uC at a rate of
0.1uC every 2 seconds. The adapters were divided into single-use
aliquots and stored at -20uC.

Genomic DNA was prepared using a DNEasy Blood and Tissue

kit
(quantified by NanoDrop) was fragmented to an average size of
200 bp using Covaris Adaptive Focused Acoustics technology with
the settings: 20% Duty Cycle; Intensity 5; 200 Cycles per burst
over the course of 3 minutes. After end repair and A-tailing
following the standard Illumina protocols, the ligation reactions
were set up in a total volume of 50 ml containing 10 ml template
DNA, 20:1 molar access of adapters, 1x Illumina DNA ligation
buffer and 5 ml Illumina DNA ligase (2,000 U/ml). The reactions
were incubated for 15 minutes at 20uC. Ligated samples were run
on a 2% agarose gel and DNA fragments of the desired size
extracted using a Gel extraction kit (Qiagen).

Library quantification and sequencing

Libraries were quantified by qPCR, using three dilutions of a
standard library (a similar library of known concentration) as a
control [39]. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina GAII
Analyzer following the manufacturer’s standard protocols.

Genome assembly

Fastq files generated from the Illumina pipeline were converted
to standard fastq format and filtered to remove exactly duplicated
reads. The unique reads were aligned to the C. elegans reference
genome (release WS203) using the BWA alignment program
(Burrows-Wheeler Algorithm, [40], http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.
net/). SAM alignment files were further processed to create pileup
files using the SAMtools package (Sequence Alignment/Map
format tools, [40], http://samtools.sourceforge.net/). Files con-
taining N2/LSJ1 variation were generated from the Pileup format
alignment files. Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) with
variation quality scores less than 50, and small
insertions and
deletions (indels) with scores less than 25, were discarded, as was
all variation that was called ambiguously by the BWA program.
Changes identified in the LSJ1 strain were compared to those in a
total of seven N2-derived mutant lines that had been sequenced
using the Illumina platform. Any that were present in 4 or more
N2 lines were removed for separate analysis.

Larger insertions (up to 30bp) and deletions (up to 10kb) were
detected using the Pindel program [41], http://www.ebi.ac.uk/
kye/pindel/). All large deletions detected by Pindel were analysed,
and insertions were filtered for quality scores above 35.

Computational analysis of sequence changes

To analyze sequence polymorphisms we created a pipeline that
highlighted exon changes, indicated genes affected, and provided
details of coding changes. Sequencing data were compared to data
from the wild strains CB4856 and ED3054 (generated from the
same Illumina flow cells) to establish the ancestral status of each
change. To analyze mutation effects we obtained the gene
annotation for C. elegans reference genome WS203 from Ensembl
(www.ensembl.org) and overlaid the N2-LSJ1 mutations. We
separated mutations into those lying within and outside annotated
protein-coding regions (we refer to the latter as non-coding)

(Tables S1 and S2, Figure S1). For SNPs in protein coding genes,
we determined whether
they caused synonymous or non-
synonymous codon substitutions, or resided in UTR regions
(Tables S1 and S2, Figure S1).

Behavioral and Life-History Assays

Unless otherwise indicated, results for phenotypic differences
were assessed with the Lilliefors test for normality. Provided results
were normal, significances were calculated using a Student’s t Test
and P values adjusted posthoc with a Bonferroni correction. Cases
where data was not normal and other tests were necessary are
noted in figure legends. Statistics were calculated in R version
2.9.2.

Brood size and developmental rate: Individual L4 worms were
placed on fresh NGM plates seeded with OP50. Adults were
transferred each day to fresh plates until animals
stopped
producing eggs. The number of eggs laid each day was recorded,
and the total number of eggs summed to give brood size.

Lifespan: L4 worms of each strain were transferred to fresh
they stopped producing progeny. Worms were

plates until
observed daily and the number of dead individuals recorded.

Embryonic developmental rate: Embryos were dissected from
gravid hermaphrodites by placing worms in M9 and cutting with a
scalpel. Dissected embryos were washed with M9, placed in M9 on
a coverslip sealed with wax, and imaged every five minutes for
10 hours using an LSM710 confocal microscope at 22uC.
Developmental rate was assessed for each embryo by recording
the time it took for comma stage embryos to hatch.

Egg staging: 10 L4 worms were transferred to fresh NGM plates
resulting adults were
20–26 hours before the assay. The
transferred to fresh plates and allowed to lay eggs for approxi-
mately 1 hour. Plates were then examined under a Leica M165FC
dissecting microscope at 24x magnification and the stage of each
egg recorded using the categories: 2–7 cell, 8–16 cell, .16 cells.
Aggregation: Approximately 40 animals were transferred to
NGM plates that had been seeded with circular OP50 lawns at
least two days prior to the experiment. Worms were left for
1 hour, and the number of animals on and off the border of the
food, as well as the number in aggregates (groups of 2 or more
worms), was recorded.

Oxygen responses: Locomotion assays were carried out
essentially as described previously [31] except that gas flow was
controlled by a custom built manifold and flow regulator.

Genetic Mapping

Recombinant

inbred lines between N2 and LSJ1 were
constructed by crossing N2 males with LSJ1 hermaphrodites,
and vice versa. F1 males were crossed with F1 hermaphrodites,
and 50 F2 hermaphrodites were selected from each lineage (N2 or
LSJ1 males
to give a total of 100
recombinant inbred lines. These were selfed for 7 generations to
give homozygosity at most genomic locations, and the resulting
lines were genotyped using SNP-snip markers and phenotyped for
early egg laying. Correlation between LSJ1 genotype and early egg
laying phenotype was assessed using a linear model and a one-way
ANOVA. LSJ1 DNA on chromosomes II and V was introgressed
into N2 by repeated backcrossing with balancer strains CB1870
(chromosome II), CB2030 and CB2065 (chromosome V) for 7
generations and testing the resulting heterozygotes and homozy-
gotes for early egg laying. As a control, we also tested N2
backcrossed with the above balancers. To further map the
chromosome V loci, we picked CB2030 and CB2065 recombi-
nants, analysed their recombination break points using SNP

genotyping, and recorded their phenotypes when balanced with
N2, or with another recombinant.
