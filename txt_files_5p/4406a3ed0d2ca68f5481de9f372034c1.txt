Abstract 

Current  autonomous  robots  and  interfaces  are  far  from  exhibiting  the 
adaptability  of  biological  beings  regarding  changes  in  their  environment  or 
during interaction. They are not always able to provide humans the situation-
specific  and  optimal  support.  Giving  the  robot  or  its  interface  insight  into  the 
human  mind  can  open  up  new  possibilities  for  the  integration  of  human 
cognitive resources into robots and interfaces, i.e., into their intelligent control 
systems,  and  can  particularly  improve  human-machine  interaction.  For  this 
purpose,  embedded  Brain  Reading  (eBR)  was  developed.  It  empowers  a 
human-machine interface (HMI), where the machine can be a robotic system, 
to infer the human’s intention and hence her/his upcoming interaction behavior 
based on the context of the interaction and the human’s brain state. Thus, eBR 
enables to implement predictive HMIs. In my talk, I will present eBR and will 
discuss what is required to enable it.
