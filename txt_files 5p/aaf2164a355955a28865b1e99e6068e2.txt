ABSTRACT Clostridium difﬁcile infection is one of the most common health care-associated infections, and up to 40% of patients
suffer from recurrence of disease following standard antibiotic therapy. Recently, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has
been successfully used to treat recurrent C. difﬁcile infection. It is hypothesized that FMT aids in recovery of a microbiota capa-
ble of colonization resistance to C. difﬁcile. However, it is not fully understood how this occurs. Here we investigated changes in
the fecal microbiota structure following FMT in patients with recurrent C. difﬁcile infection, and imputed a hypothetical func-
tional proﬁle based on the 16S rRNA proﬁle using a predictive metagenomic tool. Increased relative abundance of Bacteroidetes
and decreased abundance of Proteobacteria were observed following FMT. The fecal microbiota of recipients following trans-
plantation was more diverse and more similar to the donor proﬁle than the microbiota prior to transplantation. Additionally, we
observed differences in the imputed metagenomic proﬁle. In particular, amino acid transport systems were overrepresented in
samples collected prior to transplantation. These results suggest that functional changes accompany microbial structural
changes following this therapy. Further identiﬁcation of the speciﬁc community members and functions that promote coloniza-
tion resistance may aid in the development of improved treatment methods for C. difﬁcile infection.
IMPORTANCE Within the last decade, Clostridium difﬁcile infection has surpassed other bacterial infections to become the lead-
ing cause of nosocomial infections. Antibiotic use, which disrupts the gut microbiota and its capability in providing colonization
resistance against C. difﬁcile, is a known risk factor in C. difﬁcile infection. In particular, recurrent C. difﬁcile remains difﬁcult
to treat with standard antibiotic therapy. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has provided a successful treatment method
for some patients with recurrent C. difﬁcile infection, but its mechanism and long-term effects remain unknown. Our results
provide insight into the structural and potential metabolic changes that occur following FMT, which may aid in the development
of new treatment methods for C. difﬁcile infection.

Clostridium difﬁcile infection (CDI) is the leading cause of

health care-associated diarrhea, and rates of CDI have signif-
icantly increased during the past decade (1). It is estimated that
there are more than 500,000 cases of CDI in the United States
annually, and estimates of the ﬁnancial burden attributed to CDI
range from $1.3 billion to $3.4 billion (2, 3). The manifestations of
CDI can range from cramps, diarrhea, and colitis potentially to
more severe outcomes, including toxic megacolon and death (1).
Of signiﬁcant concern is the rate of recurrence following an initial
CDI episode; 20 to 40% of patients do not resolve their infection
following standard CDI treatment (metronidazole or vancomy-
cin) and experience a recurrence of disease, which is associated
with increased morbidity and mortality (1, 4). Once recurrence
has occurred, the risk of subsequent recurrences is increased fur-
ther (5).

The gut microbiota plays an important part on the pathogen-
esis of CDI. A healthy gut microbiota is thought to limit coloniza-

tion by pathogens, a function of the microbiota known as coloni-
zation resistance. A major risk factor for CDI is antibiotic use,
which disrupts the normal structure of the gut microbiota and
leads to the loss of colonization resistance (6). The difﬁculty in
acquiring patient samples prior to the development of CDI has
limited the identiﬁcation of speciﬁc members of the microbiota
that are capable of providing colonization resistance against CDI
in humans. While it is hypothesized that recurrent CDI occurs due
to the inability of the indigenous microbiota to recover following
antibiotic use (7), it is still unknown whether a speciﬁc microbial
community is more prone to recurrence than others. Comparison
of the fecal microbiota in patients developing nosocomial diar-
rhea with and without C. difﬁcile colonization revealed few com-
munity differences to indicate speciﬁc community structures sus-
ceptible to CDI (8), although prior studies have demonstrated that
a small number of patients with recurrent CDI exhibited a unique
microbiota community structure (9). More than likely, the struc-

tural differences observed following antibiotics reﬂect changes in
the functional, or metabolic, environment that contribute to CDI
susceptibility (10).

In recent years, a nonantibiotic treatment method for CDI that
is capable of restoring colonization resistance to C. difﬁcile has
reemerged. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), the intro-
duction of intestinal microbiota from a healthy donor to restore
the indigenous gut microbiota, has been successfully used to treat
recurrent cases of CDI when standard therapy fails (5, 11–13).
Although the use of FMT has a reported 90% success rate for
recurrent CDI (12), the speciﬁc mechanisms by which FMT re-
stores colonization resistance remains undetermined. Recovery of
colonization resistance to C. difﬁcile has been described for both
human (14) and mouse (15, 16) studies following FMT therapy,
but few studies have explored the functional changes following
FMT. One recent study using targeted metabolites observed an
increase in secondary bile salts following FMT, suggesting that
recovery of a microbiota community capable of restoring bile salt
metabolism is important in limiting recurrent CDI (17). It is likely
that a complex set of metabolites is required for full recovery of
colonization resistance.

The primary goal of this study was to follow structural changes
of the microbiota following successful FMT to elucidate the means
by which FMT restores colonization resistance. This study inves-
tigated changes in the composition and structure of the fecal mi-
crobiota before and after FMT for treatment of CDI. Using 16S
rRNA-encoding gene surveys, we compared the microbiota com-
munity from pre- and post-FMT fecal samples to that in their
respective donor sample. In addition to identifying the types of
organisms capable of colonizing the gut following FMT, we aimed
to understand the functional contribution of the organisms intro-
duced, using a predictive metagenomic tool that imputes the met-
agenomic potential based on the 16S rRNA community present.

RESULTS
Patient description and data acquisition. To compare composi-
tional changes following fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT),
we used 16S rRNA sequencing with fecal samples collected before
and after FMT from 14 recipient subjects. For 10 recipients, donor
stool was available for recipient-donor comparison. All recipients
had a history of at least two recurrent C. difﬁcile infections (CDI)
following an initial infection and failed standard therapy (vanco-
mycin, metronidazole, and/or ﬁdaxomicin) (Fig. 1; see also Ta-
ble S1 in the supplemental material). Healthy donors were deﬁned
as household members or known contacts without a history of
acute or chronic gastrointestinal disease and were previously
screened for several pathogens prior to the procedure (see Mate-
rials and Methods).

Total DNA was extracted from the fecal samples, and PCR
amplicons spanning the 16S rRNA V3-V5 region were sequenced
to compare the microbial communities before and after FMT.
Following removal of low-quality or chimeric sequences, 569,880
high-quality sequences were available for analysis (an average of
14,243 sequences/sample). To characterize the microbial commu-
nities, sequences were aligned to the SILVA reference alignment
and clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (cutoff ⫽
0.02) using the software program mothur (v.1.31) (18). Sequences
were taxonomically classiﬁed, or phylotyped, using the RDP da-
tabase (v9) (19). A total of 1,796 unique OTUs were detected

within all samples, belonging to 164 genera (see Table S2 in the
supplemental material).

Fecal community structure and diversity in donor-recipient
samples following FMT. Marked differences at both the phylum
and genus levels were observed among pre-FMT, post-FMT, and
donor samples (Fig. 2; see also Fig. S1 in the supplemental mate-
rial). The majority of sequences within pre-FMT samples were
classiﬁed as Proteobacteria (48.2%), whereas the relative abun-
dance of these sequences were signiﬁcantly lower in post-FMT
(11.2%; P ⬍ 0.001 using Wilcoxon’s nonparametric test) and do-
nor (0.73%; P ⬍ 0.0001) samples. At the genus level within pre-
FMT samples, Cronobacter (17.9%) and an unclassiﬁed Enterobac-
teriaceae member (20.3%) were most abundant. Although these
genera were observed in post-FMT samples (8.8%), they consti-
tuted only 0.12% of the sequences assigned in donor samples.
Considerable genus-level diversity within the Firmicutes was de-
tected in all samples, albeit at higher levels in post-FMT (51.6%)
and donor (65.4%) samples compared to levels in pre-FMT sam-
ples (43.6%). In both post-FMT and donor samples, OTUs clas-
siﬁed as Blautia (6.0%), Lachnospiraceae (incertae sedis, 5.6%),
unclassiﬁed Lachnospiraceae
(11.0%), and Faecalibacterium
(4.3%) comprised the most abundant Firmicutes (Fig. 2). In con-
trast, Bacteroidetes members were severely depleted in pre-FMT
samples (1.3%) compared to levels in post-FMT (32.3%; P ⬍
0.0001) and donor (32.8%; P ⬍ 0.0001) samples. At the genus
level within post-FMT and donor samples, OTUs classiﬁed as Bac-
teroides (24.0%) and Alistipes (3.7%) comprised the majority of
the Bacteroidetes phylum members.

Interestingly, changes in less-abundant genera were observed
following FMT procedure (see Fig. S1 and Table S2 in the supple-
mental material). Fusobacterium (phylum Fusobacteria), which

Fecal Microbiota Transplantation

FIG 2 Relative abundances of most abundant OTUs in donor and pre- and post-FMT samples. Heat map of most abundant OTUs (⬎2% of all sequences),
classiﬁed by phylum, family, and genus. Samples were clustered based on the Morisita-Horn distance matrix using the R package “vegan” and color coded by
sample type (donor or pre- or post-FMT sample).

was not detected in donor samples at ⬎1 sequence total, was de-
tected in 6/14 recipients prior to FMT and remained detectable in
only two patients post-FMT. Conversely, Akkermansia (phylum
Verrucomicrobia) was observed in 6/14 recipients post-FMT yet
was absent in their pre-FMT samples. Of the three donor samples
available for these recipients, all donor samples had high levels of
Akkermansia. These results support the potential transfer of new
organisms/communities from donor to recipient during FMT.

To evaluate overall compositional changes occurred following
FMT, we calculated species richness by estimating the number of
unique OTUs and utilized the Shannon diversity index to estimate
diversity. Signiﬁcance was calculated using the nonparametric
Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The observed species richness was in-
creased in post-FMT samples, nearing the level observed in donor
samples (Fig. 3A). However, overall post-FMT community rich-
ness was signiﬁcantly decreased compared to that for donor sam-
ples. Similarly, the Shannon diversity index was signiﬁcantly in-
creased following FMT but signiﬁcantly decreased compared to
that for donor samples (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these data sup-
port at least partial recovery of the community diversity following
FMT.

Comparison of structural similarity among donor and pre-
and post-FMT samples. To compare community structure and
similarity among post-FMT, pre-FMT, and donor samples, we
determined the number of OTUs shared between recipient-donor
pairs. The shared species richness (number of shared OTUs) be-
tween recipient-donor pairs was signiﬁcantly higher between
post-FMT and donor samples than that for any comparison to
pre-FMT samples (Fig. 4A), supporting the observation that do-
nor organisms were transferred and maintained in the recipients.
As a further comparison of the paired samples, we calculated
the Yue-Clayton similarity index (␪
YC), a multivariate metric that
accounts for abundance of representative OTUs. Similar to the
observed shared species richness, ␪
YC similarity was signiﬁcantly
higher between donor and post-FMT samples than for either
compared to pre-FMT samples (Fig. 4B). Additionally, ordination
supported distinct clustering of pre-FMT, post-FMT, and donor
samples (analysis of molecular variance [AMOVA], P ⬍ 0.001)
(Fig. 5; see also Fig. S3 in the supplemental material). We calcu-
lated the correlation of each axis with OTU abundance and de-
tected several OTUs likely to contribute signiﬁcantly to the ob-
served shifts within the axes (Fig. 5). Not surprisingly, many

abundant OTUs were signiﬁcantly correlated with sample type.
Both Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes members, such as the unclassi-
ﬁed OTU of the Lachnospiraceae family and Bacteroides, were sig-
niﬁcant drivers toward healthy and donor status. Conversely, Pro-
teobacteria members, such as Cronobacter, were correlated toward
the pre-FMT state direction.

Predicted functional potential pre- and post-FMT. In addi-
tion to the provision of a healthy community structure, FMTs may
provide a functional component via the introduction of healthy
members. We sought to analyze the relationship between the mi-
crobiota structure and function involved in maintaining coloni-

zation resistance against C. difﬁcile by employing a computational
method, PICRUSt (phylogenetic investigation of communities by
reconstruction of unobserved states) to predict the metagenomic
contribution of the observed microbial community within our
FMT recipient and donor samples (20).

Similar to the OTU proﬁle observed within our samples, com-
parison of the predicted Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Ge-
nomes (KEGG) orthologies (KOs) demonstrated signiﬁcant clus-
tering of pre-FMT samples from post-FMT and donor samples
(see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material). The relative abundance
of KOs present in pre-FMT samples was predominantly decreased
compared to that in post-FMT and donor samples. To encompass
the major functional categories covered by individual KOs, we
determined the overall gene pathway and module abundance us-
ing HUMAnN (HMP Uniﬁed Metabolic Analysis Network) (21).

Fecal Microbiota Transplantation

FIG 6 Metagenomic functional predictions for donor, pre-, and post-FMT samples. Mean relative gene pathway abundance of signiﬁcantly differentially
abundant modules (ANOVA; P ⬍ 0.01) for donor and pre- and post-FMT samples. Gene pathway abundances were calculated using the HUMAnN pipeline and
grouped by major functional categories.

Using analysis of variance (ANOVA), we identiﬁed 75 gene mod-
ules (consisting of 5 to 20 genes per pathway) that were signiﬁ-
cantly differentially abundant among donor, pre-, and post-FMT
samples (Fig. 6). Several modules related to basic metabolism and
biosynthesis of amino acids, nucleotides, and carbohydrates were

underrepresented in pre-FMT samples compared to donor and
post-FMT samples. For instance, NAD (KEGG module M00115),
histidine (M00026), and lysine (M00016) biosynthesis were all
signiﬁcantly decreased in pre-FMT samples. A similar pattern of
underrepresentation was seen for genes involved in core meta-

bolic pathways, such as glycolysis (M00001 and M00002) and the
pentose phosphate pathway (M00004 and M00006), with these
also being underrepresented in pre-FMT samples compared to
ﬁndings for donor samples.

Conversely, multiple gene pathways associated with stress re-
sponse and peptide transport were overrepresented in pre-FMT
samples compared to ﬁndings for both post-FMT and donor sam-
ples. The presence of pathways involved in both glutamate metab-
olism (KEGG modules M00045 and M00121) and gamma-
aminobutyric acid (GABA) biosynthesis (M00136) were increased
in pre-FMT samples (Fig. 6). In many prokaryotes, GABA pro-
duction is a stress response (22). Interestingly, some pathways that
utilize glutamate as a substrate, such as the biosynthesis of UMP
(M00051) or ornithine (M00028), were increased in donor and
post-FMT samples, suggesting an imbalance of pathways involved
in controlling glutamate metabolism within pre- and post-FMT
samples. Transport systems for amino acids, such as for histidine
(M00226), glutathione (M00348), and arginine (M00229), were
also overrepresented in pre-FMT samples. These data suggest that
in addition to the observed structural differences between recipi-
ents and donors, the potential metabolic contribution by the com-
munity is also greatly different between pre-FMT and donor/post-
FMT samples.

DISCUSSION
Although clinical recovery of CDI is ultimately diagnosed by the
resolution of clinical CDI symptoms, study protocol required
clinical testing for C. difﬁcile during the patient’s follow-up visit.
Three out of ﬁve recipients who tested positive for C. difﬁcile using
the Illumigene C. difﬁcile assay (Meridian Bioscience, Inc., Cin-
cinnati, OH) during their post-FMT appointment (Fig. 1, recipi-
ents 002, 003, and 012) were asymptomatic and considered to be
clinically recovered. For one symptomatic patient who tested pos-
itive for C. difﬁcile (recipient 005), a 7-day vancomycin course
resulted in successful clinical recovery and an eventual negative
test. Patient 006, who also tested positive, became symptomatic
after the initial post-FMT visit and was treated with vancomycin
for an indeﬁnite time. Other than a brief follow-up phone contact
to assess the status of the patient’s CDI symptoms up to 6 months
after the procedure, study protocol did not dictate that further
data be collected upon a positive C. difﬁcile test. Since 12 partici-
pants remained asymptomatic throughout study contact, we con-
sider this FMT study to have an 86% success rate.

We observed signiﬁcant differences in the microbiome follow-
ing FMT that support restoration of community diversity and
structure at an individual level. Our data suggest that the fecal
microbiota in post-FMT samples resembles the community of
each respective donor rather than the community observed prior
to FMT, supporting previous observations about the fecal micro-
biota community following FMT for the treatment of C. difﬁcile
(7, 11, 14, 17, 23). By comparing community composition and
structure per FMT pair, we observed differences in functional po-
tential of the microbiome based on the type of community present
within individual recipient-donor pairs. The results presented
here suggest that an imbalance of the microbiome during recur-
rent CDI is at least partially returned to healthy status following
FMT despite interindividual differences in community structure
observed prior to FMT. Interestingly, the resulting post-FMT mi-
crobial community within the recipient did not necessarily predict
C. difﬁcile test results or clinical recovery status of the recipient

patients. For instance, the post-FMT sample from patients 006
(symptomatic) and 012 (asymptomatic) both clustered within the
donor samples despite a positive C. difﬁcile test at their follow-up
visit (Fig. 2; see also Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). Simi-
larly, the post-FMT sample for patient 007 clustered among the
pre-FMT samples despite testing negative during their follow-up.
However, the post-FMT samples from patients 005 and 012,
which harbored a high abundance of Proteobacteria, clustered
within the pre-FMT samples (Fig. 2; see also Fig. S1).

Phylogenetically, a decreased abundance of Proteobacteria
members and an increased abundance of various Firmicutes and
Bacteroidetes were observed following FMT (Fig. 2; see also Fig. S1
in the supplemental material). However, we observed that the
most abundant OTUs within post-FMT samples (collected up to
1 month following the procedure) were not necessarily the most
abundant OTUs of the donor (see Table S2). It is hypothesized
that microbes from the donor directly colonize the recipient, thus
restoring colonization resistance. A longitudinal study by Hamil-
ton et al. investigated community dynamics up to 4 months fol-
lowing FMT in three patients (14). While the community post-
FMT was structurally more similar to the donor sample than the
pre-FMT sample, the most abundant OTUs ⬎3 months post-
FMT were not those of the donor. Similar observations of tran-
sient colonization by the donor community were described by
Angelberger et al., who analyzed the temporal dynamics following
FMT in ulcerative colitis patients (24). While the donor’s most
abundant OTUs were considered the most abundant within a
week post-FMT, the authors concluded that colonization by the
donor community was transient in most patients, followed by
colonization patterns that were not directly from the donor
source. This suggests a less direct contribution of FMTs in restor-
ing colonization resistance, such as functional provision of an en-
vironment conducive for growth of existing Bacteroidetes and/or
Firmicutes that can now repopulate the microbiota and/or direct
inhibition of C. difﬁcile growth via niche exclusion.

To gain insight into the functional differences among recipi-
ents with CDI and what a donor community might provide via
FMT, we used PICRUSt to predict the metagenomic contribution
of the communities observed. PICRUSt predicts metagenomic
potential by imputing the available annotated genes within a
known sequenced database, such as the KEGG catalogue, based on
the presence/absence of OTUs of a 16S rRNA survey. PICRUSt has
been utilized previously to describe differences in potential func-
tion within human samples and positively corresponds to actual
metagenomic and metabolic comparisons, despite ﬂaws used in
imputation (25, 26). Similar to the structural observations based
on 16S proﬁles, our results suggest an imbalanced representation
of gene pathways between pre- and post-FMT samples. PICRUSt
analysis suggested that core metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis
or the pentose phosphate pathway, were underrepresented, while
an increase in the types of transport pathways were overrepre-
sented, within pre-FMT samples. Furthermore, this analysis sug-
gested that differential representation of amino acid biosynthesis
pathways was present in pre-FMT compared to donor and post-
FMT samples, such as an increased coverage of pathways involved
in biosynthesis of histidine, an amino acid observed to promote

samples from individuals with inﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD)
(25). For instance, glutathione is involved in inﬂammatory cas-
cades during oxidative stress, which may be relevant in the devel-
opment of gastrointestinal inﬂammation. Although experimental
validation of the human metabolic environment that is able to
promote C. difﬁcile is necessary, metagenomic prediction tools,
such as PICRUSt, provide an important ﬁrst glance at the func-
tional contribution of a healthy community within the gut, lead-
ing to testable hypotheses.

Our results support previous observations that in addition to
changing the structural landscape of the gut (removal of speciﬁc
organisms), antibiotic-induced loss of colonization resistance af-
fects the metabolic potential of the environment as a whole (10,
28). In some individuals, this may develop into a more favorable
environment for C. difﬁcile to either colonize or grow. A study by
Theriot et al. identiﬁed signiﬁcant shifts in the intestinal metabo-
lome of antibiotic-treated mice (29). In particular, levels of sugars
that C. difﬁcile can utilize were greatly increased in susceptible
mice, reﬂective of a less diverse community structure. Addition-
ally, the abundance of taurocholic acid, a known germinant for
C. difﬁcile, was increased following antibiotic use. Few studies
have described the metabolic proﬁle of CDI patients in addition to
the structural changes. Antharam et al. observed a depleted
butyrate-producing bacterial proﬁle in CDI and diarrheal control
patients, suggesting that butyrate production may be important in
limiting C. difﬁcile growth (8). A recent study by Weingarden et al.
employed targeted and untargeted metabolomics to describe
changes in the metabolome before and after FMT and observed
similar shifts in the full metabolome, as with microbial composi-
tion (17). Speciﬁcally, they observed increased amounts of pri-
mary bile acids in recurrent CDI patients, consistent with in vitro
ﬁndings of C. difﬁcile growth and in vivo mouse models. However,
it is unclear whether these observations are a result or cause of
CDI. The availability of prospective samples prior to CDI infec-
tion in human studies is limited, making functional comparisons
prior to initial CDI difﬁcult. Additionally, the interindividual
variation of the microbiome in humans and differences in immu-
nity complicate the identiﬁcation of speciﬁc members that may
provide functional or structural colonization resistance. However,
identifying the speciﬁc metabolites, as well as the microbes that
can potentially provide these, that contribute to C. difﬁcile growth
will hopefully lead to new hypotheses of why certain individuals
become susceptible to CDI.

While current success rates are high for treatment of CDI, a
clear understanding of how FMT works has the potential to aid the
development of alternative biotherapeutics. Future methods may
include a deﬁned bacterial community that is effective in all pa-
tients without the need for donor screening or prebiotics that
improve the restoration of colonization resistance. Reports of
short-term risks, such as bacteremia, acute norovirus infection,
and IBD relapse, have been recently reported following FMT (30–
32), and a clear understanding of these potential dangers is neces-
sary to ensure the continued safety of FMT. Meanwhile, the long-
term effects of exposing the recipient to nonself microbiota are
undetermined. Because of the potential for negative downstream
effects, complete understanding of how FMT promotes microbi-
ota recovery is necessary for the advancement of biotherapeutics
in the treatment of recurrent CDI.

Fecal Microbiota Transplantation

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient enrollment and sample collection. Patients were enrolled at the
Essentia Health Duluth Clinic, Duluth, MN. Informed consent was re-
ceived from all participants under an approved Institutional Review
Board (IRB) protocol at Essentia Health Duluth Clinic (IRB no. SMDC-
09068; principal investigator, Timothy Rubin, FDA Investigational New
Drug [IND] no. 15460). To become a candidate for stool transplantation,
patients must have had a laboratory-conﬁrmed diagnosis of CDI followed
by at least two laboratory-conﬁrmed recurrences of CDI after antibiotic
treatment with metronidazole and/or vancomycin (Fig. 1; see also Fig. S1
in the supplemental material). Samples pre- and post-FMT were collected
at designated appointments before and after transplantation procedure.
Patients had brief scheduled telephone contacts at 2 weeks, 4 weeks,
3 months, and 6 months to discuss recovery and presence of recurrence or
adverse effects. Laboratory testing for C. difﬁcile toxin was conducted
during the patient’s post-FMT appointment at the time of stool collec-
tion. If a patient reported recurrence of symptoms of CDI (diarrhea or
abdominal pain) or if the follow-up C. difﬁcile toxin testing was positive,
the patient was referred to one of the study members (T. A. Rubin) for
clinical care outside of the study protocol.

Donor screening and preparation of donor stool. A healthy donor
was deﬁned as someone lacking acute gastrointestinal conditions (diar-
rhea) or chronic gastrointestinal conditions (inﬂammatory bowel disease,
microcolitis, celiac disease, sprue, or a history of colon cancer). Donors
must not have been treated with antibiotics in the 3 months preceding the
event and were screened for the following not more than 1 month before
the procedure: C. difﬁcile (toxin), hepatitis A, B, and C, syphilis, ova and
parasites, enteric bacterial pathogens, and HIV-1/HIV-2. Donor stool
(approximately 30 g or 3 cm3 in volume) was collected ⬍6 h prior to the
procedure and then brought to the clinic for preparation of the stool
suspension by laboratory staff. The stool was then combined with 90 ml
sterile saline and processed in a blender until a smooth consistency was
reached. The suspension was then ﬁltered using a coffee ﬁlter twice, yield-
ing 40 to 60 ml of stool suspension to be used for transplantation.

Fecal transplantation protocol. All protocols were approved by and
conducted at the Essentia Health Duluth Clinic, Duluth, MN, and con-
ducted as described previously (33). Prior to transplantation, patients
were treated with vancomycin (125 mg four times per day for at least
4 days) and a proton pump inhibitor the day before and the day of trans-
plantation. Transplantation was conducted nasogastrically, conﬁrming
the placement of the tube tip in the patient’s gastric antrum veriﬁed via
radiography. Approximately 25 to 50 ml of the stool suspension was as-
pirated into a syringe and administered through the nasogastric tube,
followed by ﬂushing with normal saline before removing the tube.

Sample preparation and sequencing. Total DNA was isolated using
the PowerMag soil DNA isolation kit optimized for epMotion (catalog no.
27100-4-EP; MoBio, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s di-
rections and adapted for a Biomek FXp lab automation workstation
(Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). The bacterial V3-V5 16S rRNA region was
ampliﬁed using the bar-coded 357F/926R primer set as used by the Hu-
man Microbiome Project (HMP) Consortium 454 sequencing protocol as
described previously (34). Samples were sequenced using 454 FLX Tita-
nium chemistry according to the manufacturer’s directions (Roche Diag-
nostics, Brandford, CT). Raw sequences were placed in the NCBI Se-
quence Read Archive (SRA) under the associated BioProject ID,
PRJNA238042.

Data analysis. Data were analyzed using a combination of the software
programs R, mothur, and JMP v.10.0. Sequences were processed with
mothur v.1.29.0 using the described 454 standard operating procedure
(SOP) (18). All OTUs were clustered at a cutoff of 0.02 (98% similarity)
and classiﬁed using the Ribosomal DNA Project (RDP) database (v9)
(19). Heat maps, principal coordinates analysis (PCoA), and bar plots
were created in R using the packages vegan and gplots (35, 36). Statistics
using the Wilcoxon test, analysis of molecular variation (AMOVA), and
analysis of variance (ANOVA) were calculated using JMP v.10.0 and R.

For PICRUSt, we normalized the OTU results by subsampling to the
lowest sequence count (3,500 OTUs/sample). This table was input into
the QIIME pipeline, which was used to reference the Greengenes 16S
rRNA database (v9), the required input for PICRUSt (20, 37). Within
PICRUSt, OTUs were normalized by 16S rRNA copy number, and met-
agenomes were predicted from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes (KEGG) catalogue (38). HUMAnN was used to predict down-
stream pathway coverage from the KEGG Ortholog results (21). ANOVA
in R was used to calculate the signiﬁcantly differentially abundant path-
ways (P ⬍ 0.001).
