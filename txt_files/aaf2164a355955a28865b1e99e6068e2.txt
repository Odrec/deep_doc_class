ABSTRACT Clostridium difﬁcile infection is one of the most common health care-associated infections, and up to 40% of patients
suffer from recurrence of disease following standard antibiotic therapy. Recently, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has
been successfully used to treat recurrent C. difﬁcile infection. It is hypothesized that FMT aids in recovery of a microbiota capa-
ble of colonization resistance to C. difﬁcile. However, it is not fully understood how this occurs. Here we investigated changes in
the fecal microbiota structure following FMT in patients with recurrent C. difﬁcile infection, and imputed a hypothetical func-
tional proﬁle based on the 16S rRNA proﬁle using a predictive metagenomic tool. Increased relative abundance of Bacteroidetes
and decreased abundance of Proteobacteria were observed following FMT. The fecal microbiota of recipients following trans-
plantation was more diverse and more similar to the donor proﬁle than the microbiota prior to transplantation. Additionally, we
observed differences in the imputed metagenomic proﬁle. In particular, amino acid transport systems were overrepresented in
samples collected prior to transplantation. These results suggest that functional changes accompany microbial structural
changes following this therapy. Further identiﬁcation of the speciﬁc community members and functions that promote coloniza-
tion resistance may aid in the development of improved treatment methods for C. difﬁcile infection.
IMPORTANCE Within the last decade, Clostridium difﬁcile infection has surpassed other bacterial infections to become the lead-
ing cause of nosocomial infections. Antibiotic use, which disrupts the gut microbiota and its capability in providing colonization
resistance against C. difﬁcile, is a known risk factor in C. difﬁcile infection. In particular, recurrent C. difﬁcile remains difﬁcult
to treat with standard antibiotic therapy. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has provided a successful treatment method
for some patients with recurrent C. difﬁcile infection, but its mechanism and long-term effects remain unknown. Our results
provide insight into the structural and potential metabolic changes that occur following FMT, which may aid in the development
of new treatment methods for C. difﬁcile infection.

Clostridium difﬁcile infection (CDI) is the leading cause of

health care-associated diarrhea, and rates of CDI have signif-
icantly increased during the past decade (1). It is estimated that
there are more than 500,000 cases of CDI in the United States
annually, and estimates of the ﬁnancial burden attributed to CDI
range from $1.3 billion to $3.4 billion (2, 3). The manifestations of
CDI can range from cramps, diarrhea, and colitis potentially to
more severe outcomes, including toxic megacolon and death (1).
Of signiﬁcant concern is the rate of recurrence following an initial
CDI episode; 20 to 40% of patients do not resolve their infection
following standard CDI treatment (metronidazole or vancomy-
cin) and experience a recurrence of disease, which is associated
with increased morbidity and mortality (1, 4). Once recurrence
has occurred, the risk of subsequent recurrences is increased fur-
ther (5).

The gut microbiota plays an important part on the pathogen-
esis of CDI. A healthy gut microbiota is thought to limit coloniza-

tion by pathogens, a function of the microbiota known as coloni-
zation resistance. A major risk factor for CDI is antibiotic use,
which disrupts the normal structure of the gut microbiota and
leads to the loss of colonization resistance (6). The difﬁculty in
acquiring patient samples prior to the development of CDI has
limited the identiﬁcation of speciﬁc members of the microbiota
that are capable of providing colonization resistance against CDI
in humans. While it is hypothesized that recurrent CDI occurs due
to the inability of the indigenous microbiota to recover following
antibiotic use (7), it is still unknown whether a speciﬁc microbial
community is more prone to recurrence than others. Comparison
of the fecal microbiota in patients developing nosocomial diar-
rhea with and without C. difﬁcile colonization revealed few com-
munity differences to indicate speciﬁc community structures sus-
ceptible to CDI (8), although prior studies have demonstrated that
a small number of patients with recurrent CDI exhibited a unique
microbiota community structure (9). More than likely, the struc-

tural differences observed following antibiotics reﬂect changes in
the functional, or metabolic, environment that contribute to CDI
susceptibility (10).

In recent years, a nonantibiotic treatment method for CDI that
is capable of restoring colonization resistance to C. difﬁcile has
reemerged. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), the intro-
duction of intestinal microbiota from a healthy donor to restore
the indigenous gut microbiota, has been successfully used to treat
recurrent cases of CDI when standard therapy fails (5, 11–13).
Although the use of FMT has a reported 90% success rate for
recurrent CDI (12), the speciﬁc mechanisms by which FMT re-
stores colonization resistance remains undetermined. Recovery of
colonization resistance to C. difﬁcile has been described for both
human (14) and mouse (15, 16) studies following FMT therapy,
but few studies have explored the functional changes following
FMT. One recent study using targeted metabolites observed an
increase in secondary bile salts following FMT, suggesting that
recovery of a microbiota community capable of restoring bile salt
metabolism is important in limiting recurrent CDI (17). It is likely
that a complex set of metabolites is required for full recovery of
colonization resistance.

The primary goal of this study was to follow structural changes
of the microbiota following successful FMT to elucidate the means
by which FMT restores colonization resistance. This study inves-
tigated changes in the composition and structure of the fecal mi-
crobiota before and after FMT for treatment of CDI. Using 16S
rRNA-encoding gene surveys, we compared the microbiota com-
munity from pre- and post-FMT fecal samples to that in their
respective donor sample. In addition to identifying the types of
organisms capable of colonizing the gut following FMT, we aimed
to understand the functional contribution of the organisms intro-
duced, using a predictive metagenomic tool that imputes the met-
agenomic potential based on the 16S rRNA community present.

RESULTS
Patient description and data acquisition. To compare composi-
tional changes following fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT),
we used 16S rRNA sequencing with fecal samples collected before
and after FMT from 14 recipient subjects. For 10 recipients, donor
stool was available for recipient-donor comparison. All recipients
had a history of at least two recurrent C. difﬁcile infections (CDI)
following an initial infection and failed standard therapy (vanco-
mycin, metronidazole, and/or ﬁdaxomicin) (Fig. 1; see also Ta-
ble S1 in the supplemental material). Healthy donors were deﬁned
as household members or known contacts without a history of
acute or chronic gastrointestinal disease and were previously
screened for several pathogens prior to the procedure (see Mate-
rials and Methods).

Total DNA was extracted from the fecal samples, and PCR
amplicons spanning the 16S rRNA V3-V5 region were sequenced
to compare the microbial communities before and after FMT.
Following removal of low-quality or chimeric sequences, 569,880
high-quality sequences were available for analysis (an average of
14,243 sequences/sample). To characterize the microbial commu-
nities, sequences were aligned to the SILVA reference alignment
and clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (cutoff ⫽
0.02) using the software program mothur (v.1.31) (18). Sequences
were taxonomically classiﬁed, or phylotyped, using the RDP da-
tabase (v9) (19). A total of 1,796 unique OTUs were detected

within all samples, belonging to 164 genera (see Table S2 in the
supplemental material).

Fecal community structure and diversity in donor-recipient
samples following FMT. Marked differences at both the phylum
and genus levels were observed among pre-FMT, post-FMT, and
donor samples (Fig. 2; see also Fig. S1 in the supplemental mate-
rial). The majority of sequences within pre-FMT samples were
classiﬁed as Proteobacteria (48.2%), whereas the relative abun-
dance of these sequences were signiﬁcantly lower in post-FMT
(11.2%; P ⬍ 0.001 using Wilcoxon’s nonparametric test) and do-
nor (0.73%; P ⬍ 0.0001) samples. At the genus level within pre-
FMT samples, Cronobacter (17.9%) and an unclassiﬁed Enterobac-
teriaceae member (20.3%) were most abundant. Although these
genera were observed in post-FMT samples (8.8%), they consti-
tuted only 0.12% of the sequences assigned in donor samples.
Considerable genus-level diversity within the Firmicutes was de-
tected in all samples, albeit at higher levels in post-FMT (51.6%)
and donor (65.4%) samples compared to levels in pre-FMT sam-
ples (43.6%). In both post-FMT and donor samples, OTUs clas-
siﬁed as Blautia (6.0%), Lachnospiraceae (incertae sedis, 5.6%),
unclassiﬁed Lachnospiraceae
(11.0%), and Faecalibacterium
(4.3%) comprised the most abundant Firmicutes (Fig. 2). In con-
trast, Bacteroidetes members were severely depleted in pre-FMT
samples (1.3%) compared to levels in post-FMT (32.3%; P ⬍
0.0001) and donor (32.8%; P ⬍ 0.0001) samples. At the genus
level within post-FMT and donor samples, OTUs classiﬁed as Bac-
teroides (24.0%) and Alistipes (3.7%) comprised the majority of
the Bacteroidetes phylum members.

Interestingly, changes in less-abundant genera were observed
following FMT procedure (see Fig. S1 and Table S2 in the supple-
mental material). Fusobacterium (phylum Fusobacteria), which
