Extroversion- Related Differences in Speed of Premotor and Motor Processing 

as Revealed by Lateralized Readiness Potentials_ Stahl & Rammsayer 

Abstract: 

Introverts and extroverts differentiate in speed of sensorimotor processing 

 
  Visual go/no- go task 
  No extroversion- related differences 
  BUT:  
o 
o  slower central and peripheral motor- processing 
o   lateralized readiness potential (LRP) 
o   electromyography data (EMG) 

introverts have a faster premotor processing 

  Researchers have failed when saying that there are no extroversion- related differences in 

reaction time 

  There actually are findings that show, that extroverts are faster in motor processing 

 

Summary: 

  Extroversion includes: sociability, talkativeness, liveliness, etc. 
  Difference between introverts and extroverts in psychomotor tasks: 
o  Response time measures: presents inconsistency of results 
o  Better consistency, when response latencies are divided into reaction times 

(RTstimulus onset to release of home button) and movement time (MTrelease 
of home button to press of target button) 

o   MT is faster for extroverts and slower for introverts 

  Electrophysiological studies: 

o  Elucidate differences in sensorimotor information processing 
o  Focus on : 

  N1 components: negative deflection that peaks at 100 ms after stimulus 

onset 

  Sensitive to stimulus characteristics such as intensity, modality and 

variations of attention 

  P3 components: positive deflection that peaks at 300 ms after stimulus onset 

 

Indicator of processes associated with stimulus evaluation and 
response selection 

Very different results 

  Brebener & Cooper: 

o  Extroverts depend on information processing 
o  Differenciated between: 
  Stimulus analysis 
  Response organization 

o  Excitiation resultin from response organization is stronger in extroverts than in 

introverts 

o   extroverts prefer fast responding 
o  introverts prefer introspection , take more time for stimulus analysis  

  Faster speed for motor processing in extroverts 
  Faster premotor information processing in introverts 

Method: 

  N= 56 first- year male undergraduate university students (age 19- 41) 
  Screened them with Eysenck’s Personality Questionnaire 
  CK= women 
  Group division into below- and above- median score on extroversion 
  Matching of groups  16 female introverts and 16 female extroverts 
  Were naïve about experimental hypothesis 
  Apparatus and stimuli: 

o  RF and RT were assessed by the use of force- sensitive keys 
o  Constant distance of the computer screen  
o  Visual response signals: letters u, v, w for 1.000 ms 

  Procedure: 

o  Go signals: u, v 
o  One letter right- and one letter left handed 
o  Respond as fast as possible without making mistakes 
o  No- Go signal: w 
o  Experimental session: 6 blocks (1. Block practice session)  

  12 left handed, 12 right handed and 12 no- go signals per block 

o  Session lasted about 20 min 
o  Determined RT and RF peaks  
o  Only correct answers were used  

  Electrophysiological Recordings (EEG) 

Results: 

  Behavioral Data: 

o  Extroverts responded more often to no- go trials than introverts 
o  Extroverts pushed the buttons with more force than introverts did 

  Correlation Analysis 

Discussion:  

  Recorded that RT, peak RF, TTP and response errors as behavioral measures 
  No extroversion- related differences in RT 
  Extroverts made more no- go errors than introverts  extroverts have more difficulty 

holding back a motor response than introverts 
Introverts can reduce their motor response speed to reduce their response errors 

 
  Electrophysiological analysis does not present reliable differences 
  Faster speed of promoter information processing in introverts
