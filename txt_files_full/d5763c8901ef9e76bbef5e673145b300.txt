Abstract
This  article  surveys  recent  data  and  empirical  literature  on  (trends  in)  unionization  and  its 
determinants  in  advanced  countries.  There  are  some  robust  stylized  facts,  for  instance  that 
unionization is positively related to public sector employment, establishment size, and the business 
cycle. Union-administered unemployment insurance and union presence at the workplace also 
play a positive role. However, some seemingly obvious explanations for union decline – such as 
economic globalization and changes in economic structure and workforce composition – do not 
seem to have impeded union membership everywhere; nor has the decentralization of collective 
bargaining.  It  also  remains  an  open  question  whether  changes  in  social  values  and  employee 
attitudes towards unions have affected unionization negatively.

Introduction
In the 20th century, trade unions became important labour market and political actors in 
most industrialized countries. In the 21st century, however, some observers argue that 
‘organised labour seems heading for extinction’ (The Economist, 21 September 2006). 
Since  unions’  existence  and  influence  depend  on  their  ability  to  attract  and  nurture  a 
loyal  membership,  it  is  important  to  know  which  factors  determine  the  extent  and 
stability of unionization.

Although the economic, sociological and political science literature contains a rea-
sonable amount of theoretical and empirical work on unions and their membership, rela-
tively few stylized facts have emerged and some of these are not so stylized and robust 
at all. In particular, some popular perceptions – for example, that union decline is ubiq-
uitous, that unions cannot adjust to structural changes in the economy, that some groups

in the workforce simply do not unionize, and that unions are victims of globalization – 
are highly questionable. By surveying recent empirical studies from various disciplines 
on unionization in (mostly) Western countries, this article attempts to provide a clearer 
picture of what we know (and do not know) about union membership and density.

The focus is on empirical regularities and stylized facts. These can often be related to 
theoretical considerations from various disciplines, though usually not unambiguously 
(Ebbinghaus et al., 2011; Schnabel, 2003). Tests of theoretical explanations have proved 
difficult, and empirical studies usually take an eclectic approach combining economic as 
well as socio-political considerations. Most empirical analyses of unionization use one 
(or  more)  of  three  approaches  (Ebbinghaus  and  Visser,  1999;  Schnabel,  2003).  They 
either  stress  cyclical  explanations  and  attempt  to  identify  the  macro-determinants  of 
union  growth  and  decline  by  means  of  time-series  studies,  or  they  provide  structural 
explanations and focus on individual characteristics of union (and non-union) members 
as well as on sectoral and occupational factors, using cross-sectional or panel studies, or 
they  favour  institutional  explanations  and  analyse  cross-national  variations  in  institu-
tional settings assumed to influence unionization. This distinction will be followed below 
when discussing the relationships between unionization and the business cycle, struc-
tural change, workforce composition and institutional settings.1 Since the availability of 
international (panel) datasets has recently enabled researchers to combine some of these 
approaches,  considerable  attention  will  be  given  to  such  international  analyses.  First, 
however, an update on the extent and development of unionization in advanced capitalist 
countries is in order.

Union density: Some data and developments
Comprehensive  data  on  union  membership  and  density  are  provided  by  the  ICTWSS 
Database (Visser, 2011). While these stem from different sources and comparisons across 
countries should thus be made only cautiously, this is a minor problem when making 
comparisons over time. Table 1 presents trends in union density (union membership net 
of those outside the active, dependent and employed labour force as a proportion of wage 
and salary owners in employment) in countries for which consistent data are available for 
long time periods. Density has fallen in 24 of 25 countries over the last 20 years and in 
23  of  24  countries  over  the  last  30  years  (with  the  notable  exceptions  of  Spain  and 
Finland, respectively). Over the longest possible observation period, 1960 to 2010, den-
sity has fallen in 13 out of 18 countries but increased in five countries.

Although a cross-sectional comparison of data that stem from various sources should 
not be over-interpreted, it is also apparent that density varies substantially across coun-
tries.  The  most  recent  data  for  2009–2010  range  from  around  70  percent  in  Finland, 
Sweden  and  Denmark  to  under  12  percent  in  France,  South  Korea  and  the  USA. 
Substantial variation can also be observed in previous years, and the coefficients of vari-
ation across countries calculated for these years have tended to increase over time, indi-
cating divergence rather than convergence.

Two stylized facts emerge from this brief analysis. First, density has indeed fallen 
over the last decades in almost all affluent countries. Second, density and its trends vary 
considerably  across  Western  countries,  with  no  signs  of  convergence  towards  union

decline  on  an  Anglo-Saxon  pattern.  While  these  variations  have  been  noted  before 
(Checchi and Lucifora, 2002; Schmitt and Mitukiewicz, 2012; Scruggs, 2002; Visser, 
2006), they need to be reiterated since they stand in contrast to conventional wisdom, in 
particular in Anglo-Saxon countries, that unions are about to become extinct everywhere. 
Against this background, I turn to international empirical evidence on a range of poten-
tial determinants of unionization.

Unionization and the business cycle
Following  influential  studies  for  the  USA  and  other  countries  by  Ashenfelter  and 
Pencavel (1969) and Bain and Elsheikh (1976), numerous time-series models were esti-
mated that try to explain union growth in terms of such components of the business cycle

as wage and price changes, employment growth, and unemployment (for detailed discus-
sions see the surveys by Riley, 1997 and Schnabel, 2003). In addition to their ad hoc use 
and justification of explanatory variables, a serious flaw of the older studies in the busi-
ness cycle approach is their failure to separate cycle and trend. Traditional cyclical mod-
els mainly explain the ups and downs of union membership (or density) by corresponding 
movements  in  business  cycle  variables  while  neglecting  shifts  in  underlying,  secular 
variables which may explain the trend.

Carruth and Disney (1988) were the first to distinguish explicitly between (short-run) 
cyclical  and  (long-run)  trend  factors  of  unionization  in  the  UK,  and  in  a  study  for 
Germany, Carruth and Schnabel (1990) made the first use of co-integration techniques in 
identifying  a  long-run  equilibrium  relationship  that  can  serve  as  an  error-correction 
mechanism in the dynamic modelling of unionization. Similar empirical approaches with 
co-integration and error-correction techniques have been undertaken, for example, by 
van Ours (1992) for the Netherlands, Borland and Ouliaris (1994) for Australia, Checchi 
and  Corneo  (2000)  for  Italy  and  Checchi  and  Visser  (2005)  in  a  panel  study  of  14 
European countries.

One stylized fact emerging from these studies is that union growth is procyclical. In 
particular,  it  appears  that  employment  growth  as  well  as  price  and/or  wage  inflation 
enhances membership growth, at least in the short term. In contrast, a rise in unemploy-
ment tends to reduce union growth and density (except in countries with a union-admin-
istered unemployment insurance, on which see below). Although estimated speeds of 
adjustment in many error-correction models are relatively low (Calmfors et al., 2001), in 
most European countries a return to lower unemployment thus works in the direction of 
stabilizing union density. This implies that in those countries it might be appropriate for 
unions to pursue strategies (or not oppose government policies) aimed at preventing or 
reducing unemployment.

Unionization and structural change
It is often argued that union growth and decline are influenced by secular trends that 
change  the  industrial  structure  from  high-  to  low-unionized  sectors  and  workplaces 
(Polachek, 2004). Examples are the shift in employment from manufacturing to private 
services, the reduction in average firm size that often goes with this and the changing 
importance of public sector employment. A closer look at the empirical evidence, how-
ever, reveals that purely sectoral explanations of union decline are too narrow.

Some  international  studies  for  groups  of  countries  find  that  a  shift  in  employment 
from manufacturing (the traditional union stronghold) to the service sector with lower 
union density (Blaschke, 2000; Lee, 2005; Polachek, 2004). Other studies report insig-
nificant effects (Brady, 2007) or varying effects depending on the specification and the 
size of the sample used (Calmfors et al., 2001). The empirical evidence from individual 
country studies is equally mixed. While some studies indicate the relevance of structural 
changes (Carruth and Schnabel, 1990 for Germany; Farber and Western, 2001 for the 
USA), many studies demonstrate that the impact of sectoral changes on union density is 
marginal (Blanchflower and Bryson, 2009 for the UK; Charlwood and Haynes, 2008 for

New Zealand; Checchi and Corneo, 2000 for Italy; Fitzenberger et al., 2011 for Germany; 
van Ours, 1992 for the Netherlands).

Parallel  to  the  decline  of  large  manufacturing  workplaces,  changes  in  the  size  of 
workplaces  reflecting  changes  in  the  organizational  structure  of  production  have 
become  important.  The  probability  of  unionization  is  usually  expected  to  rise  with 
establishment size because union costs of organizing should be lower in larger units, 
and  union  services  may  be  valued  most  highly  in  large,  bureaucratic  organizations 
where workers are likely to be treated impersonally and feel a greater need (or higher 
peer pressure) for representation (Riley, 1997; Schnabel, 2003). The empirical evidence 
clearly supports such a positive relationship. Studies using data on individuals from a 
wide range of countries included in the European Social Survey (ESS) find a positive 
correlation between establishment size and the probability of union membership when 
pooling across countries (Ebbinghaus et al., 2011; Kirmanoğlu and Başlevent, 2012) as 
well as in the majority of countries analysed separately (Schnabel and Wagner, 2007). 
Studies for individual countries also tend to show that unionization is more likely in 
larger  establishments  (for  instance,  Bain  and  Elias,  1985  for  the  UK;  Biebeler  and 
Lesch, 2007 for Germany; van den Berg and Groot, 1992 for the Netherlands). Since 
these studies are all cross-sectional, it is reassuring that a panel study for Germany by 
Fitzenberger et al. (2011) also finds a substantial positive impact of firm size on unioni-
zation. This suggests that the decline in average firm size observed in many countries 
tends to weaken unionization.

The empirical evidence is also quite clear-cut concerning the role of the public sector, 
where union organizing is said to be much easier because of lower recruitment costs in 
large  homogeneous  organizations  with  low  turnover  rates  and  low  employer  hostility 
towards  unionism  (Schnabel,  2003).  Descriptive  evidence  provided  by  Ebbinghaus 
(2006)  and Visser  (2006)  makes  clear  that  in  all  countries  analysed,  union  density  is 
considerably higher in the public than in the private sector. With one exception (Calmfors 
et al., 2001), the panel studies for groups of countries which have included this variable 
report that a higher share of public employment is associated with higher union density 
(Blaschke, 2000; Checchi and Lucifora, 2002; Checchi and Visser, 2005; Scruggs and 
Lange,  2002;  Visser,  2002). A  positive  relationship  between  public  employment  and 
unionization is also found in most cross-sectional studies for countries like the UK, the 
USA  and  Canada  (Blanchflower,  2007),  Germany  (Schnabel  and  Wagner,  2005),  the 
Netherlands (van den Berg and Groot, 1992) and for a group of 24 European countries 
(Kirmanoğlu and Başlevent, 2012).

The stylized facts emerging from this research are that everywhere unionization is 
positively related to public sector employment and to establishment size, whereas the 
impact  of  sectoral  shifts  from  manufacturing  to  private  services  remains  unclear  and 
seems to differ across countries. Note, however, that the share of public employment has 
varied over time in many countries, first increasing with the expansion of the welfare 
state and then often falling with privatization and deregulation. This means that while the 
contribution of public employment to (trends in) unionization has been important, this 
impact has not always served to stabilize union density and may even contribute to fur-
ther union decline in those countries that cut back the public sector.

Unionization and changing workforce composition
Parallel to sectoral changes in the economy, workforce composition has changed in all 
advanced countries. Usually the employment shares of women, foreign-born workers, 
atypically  employed  people,  white-collar  workers  and  highly  skilled  individuals  have 
increased over time, and this is expected to dampen unionization since some of these 
groups are supposed to have a lower attachment to the labour force, others are said to be 
more  individualistic,  and  all  of  them  seem  to  be  more  difficult  (and  more  costly)  to 
organize (Ebbinghaus et al., 2011; Schnabel and Wagner, 2007; Visser, 2006).

Starting  with  gender  effects,  it  was  often  regarded  as  a  stylized  fact  that  women 
exhibit a lower union density than men. This gap was interpreted as reflecting women’s 
weaker attachment to the labour force which would reduce the benefits of unionization 
both from the point of view of females and of unions. Over time, however, the gender 
gap  has  narrowed  and  has  disappeared  in  several  countries  (Calmfors  et  al.,  2001; 
Ebbinghaus and Visser, 2000). Descriptive evidence provided by Visser (2006) demon-
strates that in a number of countries, female union density is now equal to or even higher 
than male unionization. The comparative analysis of ESS data by Schnabel and Wagner 
(2007) shows that in eight of the 18 countries investigated, women’s density is higher 
than men’s.

Multivariate analyses also indicate that the relationship between gender and unioniza-
tion is inconclusive and varies among countries. Some cross-sectional studies using data 
of individuals pooled across countries find a significant negative effect of females on the 
probability of union membership (Brady, 2007; Kirmanoğlu and Başlevent, 2012). This, 
however, seems to vanish when controlling for atypical employment (as demonstrated by 
Ebbinghaus et al., 2011). When analysing countries separately and controlling for full-
time employment status, Schnabel and Wagner (2007) find that the gender variable is 
statistically insignificant in 11 of the 18 European countries investigated. Union density 
of women is significantly higher than that of men in the Nordic countries whereas it is 
still lower in Germany and Italy. That women are less likely to be union members is 
confirmed for Germany by Goerke and Pannenberg (2007), and for the Netherlands by 
van den Berg and Grift (2001), while Blanchflower (2007) obtains the same result for the 
UK, the USA and Canada (but varying estimation coefficients across other countries). In 
these few countries it thus might make sense for unions to focus their organizing efforts 
more on women. It is, however, difficult to draw more general conclusions. What seems 
clear is that in most countries the rising share of women in employment per se should not 
be a major obstacle to union growth. It may rather be the rise in atypical jobs mostly held 
by women that poses a problem for unionization.

In  most  advanced  countries,  the  employment  share  of  standard  full-time  jobs  has 
fallen in the last decades while atypical employment (such as part-time jobs, fixed-term 
contracts or temporary agency jobs) has been on the rise. This poses recruitment prob-
lems  for  unions  since  atypically  employed  workers  usually  have  weaker  ties  to  their 
current  workplace  and  are  more  difficult  to  recruit  and  keep  as  union  members.  The 
benefits of unionization may be lower both from the perspective of these workers and of 
unions, so that the latter have concentrated on organizing full-time workers. Ebbinghaus 
(2006) and Visser (2006) provide descriptive evidence for several countries that there is

a considerable gap in unionization between full-time and part-time (or other atypically 
employed) workers. In a cross-sectional analysis pooling data for individuals from 19 
European countries, Ebbinghaus et al. (2011) obtain a highly significant negative rela-
tionship between atypical employment and the probability of being unionized whereas 
Schnabel  and  Wagner  (2007)  find  very  few  significant  correlations  between  working 
full-time and being a union member when using the same data but analyzing countries 
separately. There  are,  however,  some  country  studies  showing  that  part-time  employ-
ment significantly lowers (or full-time employment increases) the probability of union 
membership (Blanchflower, 2007 for Canada, the USA and the UK). While these find-
ings are from cross-sectional studies, a panel study by Fitzenberger et al. (2011) also 
shows that working part-time reduces the probability of being unionized in West Germany 
(but not in East Germany), and the longitudinal analysis by Bodman (1998) finds that the 
rapid rise in part-time employment had a significant negative impact on unionization in 
Australia. As atypical employment continues to increase in many countries, this is bad 
news for the union movement.

Whether a rising share of foreign-born employees dampens unionization is an open 
question, not least because there is little empirical evidence. Hechter (2004) claims that 
ethnic heterogeneity resulting from immigration undermines solidarity and hence union-
ization;  this  receives  some  support  from  the  finding  by  Lee  (2005)  that  international 
migration is negatively associated with union density in a sample of 16 affluent OECD 
countries. In contrast, Schnabel and Wagner (2007) find no significant differences in the 
probability of union membership for native and foreign-born workers in the majority of 
European countries analyzed, and Brady (2007) even reports that foreign-born workers 
and net migration are positively related to the likelihood of being a union member.

Since  blue-collar  workers  have  been  unions’  traditional  stronghold,  the  shift  in 
employment towards white-collar work can be expected to reduce union membership 
and density. White-collar workers are said to have less homogeneous preferences and 
working conditions and weaker traditions and social customs of unionization. However, 
Schnabel and Wagner (2007) report that in 2002–2003 only in nine of the 17 European 
countries  investigated  was  union  density  lower  for  white-collar  than  for  blue-collar 
workers. Moreover, in their multivariate analyses a blue-collar worker dummy proved 
positive and highly significant in just two countries. More relevant for unionization than 
the outmoded distinction between blue- and white-collar workers may be the impact of 
education and qualification, which is investigated in a larger number of studies.

While skilled blue-collar workers are the traditional clientele of unions in most coun-
tries, employees with higher education are often assumed to be less willing to unionize, 
which might pose a problem for unions given rising educational levels in all countries. 
Better educated employees probably have greater individual bargaining power and thus 
lesser need for collective voice. However, the empirical evidence is not clear-cut. In a 
cross-sectional analysis pooling data for individuals from 18 affluent democracies in the 
late  1990s,  Brady  (2007)  finds  that  the  likelihood  of  being  unionized  rises  with  each 
level of education, and is higher for skilled manual workers than for other categories of 
employees such as clerical, manual or unskilled workers. Using pooled data for individu-
als from 24 European countries from the ESS 2008, Kirmanoğlu and Başlevent (2012) 
obtain a linear and positive relationship between years of schooling and the probability

of being a current or former member of a union. With data from the ESS 2002–2003, 
however, Ebbinghaus et al. (2011) find a curvilinear relationship: with increasing years 
of education, the probability of being a union member first increases and then decreases 
at about 15 years of full-time education (with a university degree). In contrast, dummy 
variables for levels of education are found to be insignificant in the majority of countries 
by Schnabel and Wagner (2007) when using the same dataset but analysing countries 
separately. What most studies tend to overlook, however, is the distinction between the 
private and public sectors. Analysing large individual datasets for the UK, the US and 
Canada, Blanchflower (2007) demonstrates that more educated workers are less likely to 
be union members in the private sector and more likely in the public sector.

Workforce  composition  in  all  developed  countries  is  also  increasingly  affected  by 
demographic  change. A  rising  average  age  of  the  workforce  and  cohort  replacement 
effects (in particular, stronger and higher organized cohorts retiring from the workforce) 
may affect union density if unionization varies in the age dimension. Descriptive evi-
dence for European countries presented by Ebbinghaus (2006) indicates that union den-
sity tends to be relatively low among young workers, increases with age, and falls when 
employees are near retirement. Such a concave relationship is also obtained in several 
multivariate analyses; but possible explanations (differential need for unions; different 
free-riding behaviour; different attitudes towards unions; structural and cohort effects) 
remain vague. With cross-sectional data for individuals, Blanchflower (2007) finds that 
the probability of being unionized follows an inverted U-shaped pattern in age, maximiz-
ing in the mid- to late 40s in 34 of the 38 countries investigated. However, such a pattern 
is  statistically  significant  in  only  four  of  the  18  countries  analysed  by  Schnabel  and 
Wagner  (2007),  which  may  be  because  they  employ  more  control  variables  than 
Blanchflower (2007). Further studies for individual countries that find a concave rela-
tionship include Goerke and Pannenberg (2007) for West Germany and Van Rie et al. 
(2011) for Denmark and Sweden. Pooling data across countries, Ebbinghaus et al. (2011) 
and Kirmanoğlu and Başlevent (2012) also obtain a concave age-unionization pattern, 
whereas Brady (2007) only tests and finds a linear relationship.

From this empirical evidence it seems safe to conclude that younger employees are 
least likely to be unionized, possibly because they are less interested in joining organiza-
tions that they perceive to represent primarily the interests of older workers (Ebbinghaus, 
2006) or because unionization is an ‘experience good’ and there is greater unsatisfied 
demand for union representation amongst young workers (Bryson et al., 2005). It is dif-
ficult to make more definite statements since there are two problems with most of the 
studies finding a significant relationship between age and unionization. First, the stand-
ard methods usually applied when testing for the joint significance of the linear and the 
quadric term in age do not seem to be fully appropriate (Schnabel and Wagner, 2012). 
Second, it cannot be ruled out that the age effects detected in these cross-sectional studies 
are confounded with cohort effects. Addressing that question for the US and the UK, 
Blanchflower  (2007)  finds  that  cohort  effects  exist  but  that  removing  these  does  not 
remove the inverted U-shape in age.

Using  cohort  analysis,  Schnabel  and  Wagner  (2008)  show  that  both  intra-cohort 
change and cohort replacement effects have played a roughly equal role in the substantial 
fall in union density in West Germany. Decomposing age, time and year effects, Böckerman

and Uusitalo (2006) obtain cohort profiles indicating that a large fraction of the decline 
in union density in Finland during the 1990s can be attributed to the decrease in density 
among the cohorts born after the early 1960s. Cohort effects pose serious problems for 
unions  for  at  least  two  reasons.  First,  if  older  cohorts  with  high  union  densities  are 
replaced by young cohorts with low densities (as in Germany and Finland), this implies 
that average density falls. Second, demographic change in many countries means that 
future cohorts of potential union members will be smaller than those they replace. This 
means that even if union density of new cohorts were the same as that of exiting cohorts, 
the smaller size of new cohorts would result in a fall of total membership. Density would 
not then fall, but unions would probably face increasing financial problems because of 
the fixed costs of maintaining a shrinking organization. While unions will not be able to 
influence  demographic  change,  they  must  intensify  recruitment  efforts  among  young 
employees. Although such a strategy may be expensive, it would clearly pay off if these 
cohorts become strongly unionized and if the young employees stay in the union and in 
the labour market for a long period of time.

Taken as a whole, these results suggest that changes in the composition of the work-
force play some role in explaining the changes in unionization observed in the last dec-
ades, but the contribution of compositional changes seems smaller than widely believed. 
Several country studies explicitly investigating the explanatory power of compositional 
changes underscore this conclusion (Andrews and Naylor, 1994 for the UK; Böckerman 
and  Uusitalo,  2006  for  Finland;  Charlwood  and  Haynes,  2008  for  New  Zealand; 
Fitzenberger et al., 2011 for Germany; Magnani and Prentice, 2003 for the USA; van den 
Berg  and  Grift,  2001  for  the  Netherlands). These  findings  imply  that  de-unionization 
would have occurred even in the absence of compositional changes.

If such decomposition analyses are right and it is changes in the coefficients estimated 
rather  than  compositional  changes  that  seem  to  drive  variations  in  unionization,  then 
changing attitudes of employees towards unions and changing social values may play a 
more  important  role.  Stressing  individualization  processes,  for  instance,  it  could  be 
argued  that  there  is  a  diffusion  of  more  individualistic  life  styles  and  post-materialist 
values (Inglehart, 1977) and that collective and group-specific orientation schemes lose 
their importance over time (Beck, 1994), which may contribute to union decline. Using 
data  from  the  ESS  2008,  Kirmanoğlu  and  Başlevent  (2012)  show  that  basic  personal 
values  are  related  to  (current  and  former)  union  membership  status.  Higher  self-tran-
scendence and conservation scores are associated with a greater probability of being a 
current member whereas higher openness-to-change and self-enhancement scores reduce 
the  likelihood  of  unionization.  Drawing  on  the  ‘rising  individualism’  argument,  the 
authors argue that changing personal values may have been an important factor behind 
the decline in union membership, but it should be noted that they were only able to con-
duct  a  cross-sectional  analysis.  Further  cross-sectional  analyses  show  that  individual 
union  membership  accompanies  pro-union  attitudes,  such  as  Visser  (2002)  for  the 
Netherlands and Schnabel and Wagner (2007) for most countries in Western Europe (but 
not for some post-communist countries in Eastern Europe). Biebeler and Lesch (2007) 
show that on average the attitudes of West German workers have (slightly) changed over 
the last 20 years towards a stronger emphasis on self-responsibility and economic free-
dom,  and  that  a  composite  index  of  economic  freedom  is  negatively  correlated  with

union membership. What is needed, however, are panel analyses showing that there have 
been substantial changes in individual employees’ attitudes and values over time and that 
this has indeed affected unionization. Since the empirical evidence on this point is very 
limited, ‘it must remain a matter of speculation whether employees are less motivated by 
collective values than, say, one or two generations ago’ (Calmfors et al., 2001: 31) and 
whether this has really contributed to falling union membership.

Unionization, institutional settings and globalization
There exist a number of institutional explanations that mainly focus on cross-national vari-
ations in unionization but which also can be used to explain union growth and decline over 
time. Variables emphasized in this literature dominated by political scientists and sociolo-
gists  (Brady,  2007;  Ebbinghaus  and  Visser,  1999;  Scruggs  and  Lange,  2002;  Western, 
1997)  include  union-administered  unemployment  insurance,  closed-shop  arrangements 
and union access to the workplace as well as structures of collective bargaining. In a wider 
sense, changes in the economic environment induced or favoured by changes in govern-
ment regulation, such as increasing globalization, also fall into this category.

One institutional variable that has been found strongly to affect unionization in most 
cross-national studies is the provision or administration of unemployment insurance by 
trade unions. This ‘Ghent system’ comes in two variants: either in the form of voluntary 
unemployment insurance funds set up by the unions and subsidized by the state, as in 
Sweden,  Denmark  and  Finland,  or  as  a  compulsory  unemployment  insurance  system 
partly administered by union officials, as in Belgium. Although union-run unemploy-
ment  insurance  may  not  be  a  ‘selective  incentive’  as  defined  by  Olson  (1965),  since 
union membership is usually not compulsory for those insured and there exist alterna-
tives options of acquiring insurance, the important role of union officials in the provision 
of unemployment benefits and the regular contact with the union during spells of unem-
ployment are said to motivate workers strongly to join unions and remain members 
when unemployed (for details, see Holmlund and Lundborg, 1999; Scruggs, 2002; Van 
Rie et al., 2011).

The high union density rates in the three Nordic countries and Belgium are therefore 
often attributed to positive effects of their Ghent systems. It is striking that among the 25 
countries listed in Table 1, density is indeed highest in Finland, Sweden and Denmark, 
with  Belgium  ranked  fifth  in  2010. A  number  of  multivariate  cross-sectional  studies 
show that Ghent system countries enjoy a substantial advantage in unionization (Brandl, 
2009; Ebbinghaus and Visser, 1999; Wallerstein and Western, 2000) and that individual 
employees  in  these  countries  are  much  more  likely  to  be  unionized,  ceteris  paribus 
(Brady, 2007; Ebbinghaus et al., 2011).

A similar picture emerges when long-term changes in union density are analysed. It 
may be no coincidence that in the period 1980 to 2010 density has remained most stable 
in Finland and Belgium (among the 24 countries listed in Table 1). When the percentage 
point change in union density between 1980 and 2010 is regressed on the starting value 
of density in 1980 and a dummy variable that takes the value of 1 for the four Ghent 
system countries, the following estimation results emerge (N = 24, R²= 0.596, t-statistics 
in parentheses):

The Ghent dummy and the starting level of union density explain almost 60 per-
cent of the variance in changing union density (whereas the density level on its own 
would explain less than 11%). Taken at face value, the coefficient of the Ghent dummy 
variable implies that the decline in union density over the period 1980 to 2010 was 27 
percentage points lower in countries with a Ghent system. A number of other studies 
(Blaschke, 2000; Checchi and Lucifora, 2002; Ebbinghaus and Visser, 1999; Scruggs, 
2002) confirm that the Ghent system has been associated with higher growth rates in 
density in various periods. Longitudinal analyses by Checchi and Visser (2005) and 
Visser  (2006)  further  indicate  that  while  in  general  unemployment  has  a  negative 
impact  on  union  density  in  the  short  and  long  run,  its  impact  is  positive  in  Ghent 
countries.

Given  this  impressive  empirical  evidence  on  the  importance  of  Ghent  systems  for 
promoting and sustaining high levels of union density, it might be asked whether the 
Ghent system is a possible cure for declining unionization in other countries. Pointing 
out that the majority of former countries with Ghent systems replaced these by manda-
tory insurance many decades ago, Van Rie et al. (2011) consider it highly unlikely that 
others countries will adopt a Ghent system. Moreover, they argue that the Belgian insti-
tutional set-up only stimulates union membership among particular groups and that the 
Ghent systems in the Nordic countries have been subject to erosion as unemployment 
insurance has become more costly and less generous (Lind, 2009). More specifically, 
Böckerman and Uusitalo (2006) opine that the fall in union density in Finland since the 
1990s mainly reflects the erosion of the Ghent system with the emergence of an inde-
pendent  unemployment  insurance  fund  not  requiring  union  membership.  Kjellberg 
(2011) argues that the substantial increase in fees for union unemployment funds initi-
ated by the centre-right government in 2007 is the main reason for the unprecedented 
decline in unionization in Sweden in recent years. The stabilizing effect of Ghent sys-
tems on union density should thus not be taken for granted and will most probably con-
tinue to be restricted to a small number of countries.

Another institutional variable that seems to play an important role for unionization is 
unions’ access to or presence at the workplace. This can be expected to increase union 
membership in various ways, for instance by facilitating unions’ recruitment efforts, ena-
bling them to represent visibly the interests of the workforce and creating social custom 
and reputation effects (Schnabel and Wagner, 2007). Following Ebbinghaus and Visser 
(1999), several cross-national analyses have included indicators of the degree of institu-
tionalized union access to the workplace in. Empirical analyses usually find that union 
access to the workplace significantly increases individuals’ probability of being a union 
member (Brady, 2007), that it is associated with higher union density (Ebbinghaus and 
Visser, 1999) and that it also positively affects changes in density (Checchi and Lucifora, 
2002; Checchi and Visser, 2005; Visser, 2002).2 Studies focusing on the actual presence 
of a union at the workplace rather than on its institutionalized access point in the same 
direction. In a cross-sectional analysis pooling data for individuals from 19 European 
countries,  Ebbinghaus  et  al.  (2011)  obtain  a  highly  significant  positive  relationship

between the presence of a union at the workplace and the probability of being unionized. 
When  using  the  same  data  but  analysing  countries  separately,  Schnabel  and  Wagner 
(2007) find union presence to be a strong predictor of union membership in almost all 
countries. The empirical evidence suggests that unions which want to increase or stabi-
lize their membership should try to increase (or at least maintain) their presence at the 
workplace, even if this might be opposed by employers and might become more difficult 
and more expensive as workplaces become smaller.

Unionization may also depend on a country’s structure of collective bargaining, with 
more centralized bargaining usually considered conducive to higher density (Scruggs 
and Lange, 2002). One reason is that bargaining centralization can reduce employers’ 
incentives to eliminate unions from their workplaces (because these now tend to inter-
fere less in workplace management and local wage-setting). Centralized bargaining also 
lowers transaction costs, helps to solve the latent conflict between capital and labour 
and can bring macroeconomic benefits, so that governments may have an interest in 
maintaining strong unions. On the other hand, bargaining centralization may make it 
easier for employees to free-ride on collective agreements without being members, in 
particular when these are extended to non-unionized employees and workplaces. The 
theoretical relationship between centralization and unionization is thus open, and the 
empirical evidence is equally mixed. Some cross-national studies report a positive rela-
tionship between unionization and bargaining centralization (Western, 1997) while oth-
ers obtain findings that are insignificant and/or difficult to interpret (Blaschke, 2000; 
Brady, 2007, Sano and Williamson, 2008; Scruggs and Lange, 2002). Panel studies for 
14  European  countries  by Visser  (2002)  and  Checchi  and Visser  (2005)  suggest  that 
centralization had a significant positive impact on unionization in the period 1950 to 
1996–1997, whereas Checchi and Lucifora (2002) find that the bargaining centraliza-
tion/coordination variable sometimes loses statistical significance and changes signs in 
their panel estimates for 13 countries between 1960 and 2000. Given these conflicting 
results it would be premature to predict that the recent trend towards decentralization of 
collective bargaining in several countries will automatically bring large-scale deunioni-
zation.  While  there  may  be  good  reasons  for  unions  to  oppose  decentralization  (for 
instance, higher transaction costs), membership considerations alone do not necessarily 
suggest such a strategy.

In comparison with some of the institutional variables discussed above, the empirical 
evidence  concerning  the  impact  of  globalization  on  unionization  is  more  limited. 
Although increasing national openness to trade, financial flows and foreign direct invest-
ment (FDI) is often thought to undermine unionization by weakening unions’ bargaining 
power and thus their attractiveness to employees, unions may also benefit from globali-
zation, for instance by serving as vehicles of insurance against volatile global market 
forces  (Brady,  2007;  Scruggs  and  Lange,  2002).  While  the  theoretical  relationship 
between  globalization  and  (de-)unionization  is  thus  open,  the  empirical  evidence  has 
become more and more univocal. Weak evidence for globalization effects is only pro-
vided by Western (1997) who finds that trade openness increased the likelihood that an 
advanced  country  would  experience  a  decline  in  unionization  in  the  1980s,  and  by 
Blaschke (2000) who reports a small dampening effect of trade openness on changes in 
union density in some of her specifications for the period 1970 to 1995.

In contrast, Scruggs and Lange (2002), in an analysis of 16 advanced countries in the 
period 1964 to 1994, show that controlling for cyclical and demographic features there 
are no robust significant relationships between changes in union density and increasing 
financial  market  openness,  FDI  flows  or  increased  trade  flows.  Similarly,  Sano  and 
Williamson (2008) find no robust impact of FDI and trade openness in a pooled sample 
of 18 OECD countries from 1980 to 2005, and for a panel of 14 European countries 
Checchi and Visser (2005) report that changes in union density are unaffected by proxies 
for increased globalization. In a multilevel analysis for a group of 18 affluent democra-
cies in the late 1990s, Brady (2007) finds that net trade and investment do not signifi-
cantly  affect  unionization  (see  also  Martin  and  Brady,  2007).  Finally,  an  analysis  of 
manufacturing  industries  in  the  USA  by  Magnani  and  Prentice  (2003)  concludes  that 
globalization as visible in international and domestic market competition cannot explain 
the bulk of the substantial decline in unionization in the period 1973 to 1994. This empir-
ical evidence stands in stark contrast to the widespread impression that globalization has 
undermined employees’ likelihood of being union members. It implies that unionization 
has neither been severely affected by institutional changes deregulating certain markets 
(in particular financial markets) nor can it be expected to benefit much from the re-regu-
lation of these markets.3

Conclusions
This article has shed some light on what we know and do not know about (trends in) 
unionization and its determinants in advanced countries. It has shown that there are 
relatively few robust stylized facts, and that some seemingly obvious explanations for 
the decline in unionization over the last decades do not hold on closer scrutiny. In 
particular,  the  following  perceptions  often  found  in  the  general  public  have  been 
debunked as myths. First, unions are not about to vanish everywhere. While density 
has  indeed  fallen  in  almost  all  advanced  countries,  it  has  remained  high  in  some 
European  countries  (in  particular  the  Nordic  countries).  Second,  union  growth  and 
decline are not mainly outcomes of changes in the sectoral structure of the economy 
and the composition of the workforce. Third, economic globalization in recent dec-
ades does not seem to have substantially undermined unionization. Fourth, the rela-
tionship between centralization of collective bargaining and unionization is open both 
theoretically and empirically; bargaining decentralization thus does not necessarily 
imply deunionization.

That said, the empirical literature does point to some regularities that may indeed be 
interpreted as stylized facts. First, union density and trends in unionization vary consid-
erably  across  Western  countries,  with  no  clear  signs  of  convergence.  Second,  union-
administered  unemployment  insurance  is  associated  with  higher  union  density  and 
smaller falls in density over time. Third, union access to, and presence at, the workplace 
play an important, positive role for (changes in) unionization. Fourth, unionization is 
related to the business cycle, with union growth being procyclical. In many countries a 
rise in unemployment tends to reduce union growth and density (but in countries with a 
Ghent system the reverse is the case). Fifth, in almost all countries unionization is posi-
tively  related  to  public  sector  employment  and  to  establishment  size.  Sixth,  younger

employees are generally less likely to be unionized (but it is less clear whether the prob-
ability of being unionized always follows an inverted U-shaped pattern in age).

Of course, this review of the empirical evidence can only provide a crude picture of 
major factors that seem to play a role for unionization, neglecting country-specific condi-
tions, national traditions, historical influences and differences between the Anglo-Saxon 
world and European welfare states (Schmitt and Mitukiewicz, 2012) that may also be 
relevant. Empirical studies have not always been able to disentangle the effects of paral-
lel and related developments (such as sectoral changes and changes in the composition 
of the workforce), to take full account of interactions between variables (such as institu-
tions,  business  cycle  effects  and  personal  characteristics),  and  to  establish  causation 
rather  than  just  correlation  between  variables.  The  empirical  evidence  also  does  not 
enable us to discriminate between alternative (but often related) theories from various 
disciplines. For these and other reasons, this review does not claim to provide a general 
explanation of union growth and decline.4 Nevertheless, the empirical regularities identi-
fied can be used to assess how unions will be affected by recent economic and social 
trends present in most countries and to speculate whether they will be able to cope with 
these challenges.

In contrast to widespread perceptions, some trends like economic globalization and 
the rising proportions of women, white-collar workers and highly educated employees in 
the workforce do not seem to have impeded union membership and density, and probably 
they will not pose serious problems for unions in the future. Similarly, given the mixed 
empirical evidence it seems premature to predict that the trend towards bargaining decen-
tralization in many countries will go along with large-scale deunionization. Given the 
lack of long-term empirical evidence it also remains an open question whether changes 
in  social  values,  rising  individualism  and  changing  attitudes  of  employees  towards 
unions have affected or will affect unionization negatively.

More  important  and  empirically  founded  challenges  for  unions  in  most  advanced 
countries seem to be demographic change (in particular, stronger and higher organized 
cohorts retiring from the workforce) and the difficulty in recruiting young employees. A 
major problem for the unions may also be that the employment share of the public sector, 
which is still a union stronghold, has been falling and may fall further because of privati-
zation, subcontracting and the shrinking of the welfare state. Another challenge comes 
from  the  rise  in  atypical  employment  visible  in  most  countries,  since  several  studies 
indicate  that  part-timers  and  other  atypically  employed  workers  are  more  difficult  to 
organize than other workers with stronger attachments to the labour market. Since union-
ization is positively correlated with firm size, the decline in the average size of firms in 
many countries may also undermine unionization, in particular if a reduction in union 
presence at the workplace accompanies this. Finally, in countries with a Ghent system, 
its erosion poses a serious threat to union membership and density.

Some of these trends working against unionization (such as demographic change and 
the decline in average firm size) cannot be influenced by the unions. Some others, how-
ever, may at least be dampened if the labour movement can exert political influence and 
successfully  oppose  further  privatization,  deregulation  and  reform  of  unemployment 
insurance systems. In addition, there are still large gaps in unionization that can be filled 
by effective union organization. Although a discussion of union recruitment and renewal

strategies (Frege and Kelly, 2004; Gall, 2009) is beyond the scope of this article, it seems 
obvious  that  recruitment  efforts  should  be  (more)  focused  on  young  and  atypically 
employed workers (in some countries also on women), that upholding or increasing union 
presence at the workplace is crucial for keeping and winning union members and that in 
general unions should probably more open up to new social interests (Ebbinghaus, 2006).
While  recent  reports  of  ‘union  revitalization’,  mainly  from Anglo-Saxon  countries 
(Gall, 2009) should not be overemphasized, unions in many countries, particularly in 
Western Europe, still have some chance to stabilize membership and density, not least 
because they are embedded in social, economic and political structures that help sustain 
them  (Bryson  et  al.,  2011).  For  decades,  public  perception  of  unions  has  been  that 
‘they’re  going  out  like  a  dinosaur’,  as  expressed  by  Bob  Dylan  in  his  song  ‘Union 
Sundown’  (released  in  1983!).  However,  unions  are  still  alive  and  reversals  in  union 
fortunes have happened in the past in many countries, so that it may be premature to 
relegate them to a museum of extinct species.

Notes
1.  Space constraints preclude us from discussing the role of some other variables that might be 
associated  with  unionization,  but  which  have  been  found  to  affect  union  membership  and 
density in an unstable way across countries and time periods. These include strikes (Calmfors 
et al., 2001; Checchi and Visser, 2005; Western, 1997), political attitudes (Kirmanoğlu and 
Başlevent,  2012;  Schnabel  and  Wagner,  2007),  the  broad  national  political  environment 
(Schmitt and Mitukiewicz, 2012) and government composition (Brady, 2007; Checchi and 
Visser, 2005; Scruggs and Lange, 2002; Western 1997), management opposition (Flanagan, 
2005; Freeman and Medoff, 1984), social capital (Ebbinghaus et al., 2011) as well as employ-
ees’ risk aversion (Goerke and Pannenberg, 2012).

2.  However, statutory employee representation and mandatory works councils do not necessarily 
exert a positive influence on unionization (Blaschke, 2000; Goerke and Pannenberg, 2007), and 
closed-shop practices that used to be common in Ireland and the UK do not always strengthen 
aggregate union density and density growth (Blaschke, 2000; Ebbinghaus and Visser, 1999).

3.  That  globalization  cannot  be  the  main  culprit  for  deunionization  is  also  suggested  by  the 
descriptive evidence reported in Table 1, which shows that in several countries union density 
has started to decline already in the 1960s, clearly prior to economic globalization, and that 
union  density  across  countries  has  diverged  over  time  (whereas  globalization  should  have 
affected countries in a largely similar way).

4.  Another reason for modesty is that we know little about the actual process of joining or leav-
ing a union, which very few studies have investigated (Van Rij and Daalder, 1997; Visser, 
2002; Waddington and Whitston, 1997).
