FIDUCIARY OWNERSHIP AND TRUSTS IN A COMPARATIVE

PERSPECTIVE

DANIEL CLARRY*

Abstract Ownership is an essential feature of trusts that serves as a useful
analytical and comparative tool in order to cross legal traditions and compare
diﬀerent legal institutions, which to a greater or lesser extent serve similar
socio-economic and legal functions. The concentration on ownership enables
one to burrow down into the normative roots of diﬀerent legal traditions. This
article comprises three substantive parts: ﬁrst, characterizing ownership and
the manner in which this concept distinguishes the civil and common law
traditions; second, contextualizing ownership in relation to trusts from diﬀer-
ent legal systems; and, third, conceptualizing some contemporary challenges
arising out of the divergent nature of ownership in the phenomenology of
the trust paradigm, the value of the trust to comparative law and its eﬀect
on the civil law as a distinct tradition. It is argued that trusts necessarily
involve the ﬁduciary administration of property and that ‘ﬁduciary ownership’
is a better shorthand description of the encumbered nature of trust property,
rather than ‘dual’ or ‘split’ ownership, which is misleading and mistaken.

Keywords: comparative law, ﬁduciary ownership, international private law, property,
trusts.

for the management of vast ﬁnancial wealth.1 The evolution of trusts remains
