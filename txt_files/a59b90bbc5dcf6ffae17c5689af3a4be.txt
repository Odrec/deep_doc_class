The problems of generalisation and decision making in research
•

limits of generalisation from any data by sampling methods and statistical significance 
testing 
generalisation is an aspect of decision making by the researcher

•
• main issues:

◦ rules of thumb for the decision-making process distort the reality of research
◦ it is not simply a matter of failing to find support for a hypothesis in a particular 

study but a decisionmaking process based not simply on basic statistical outcomes 
but on a finer judgement as to whether the hypothesis had been given a fair chance in
the research study.

Universalism
•

assumptions imply to be universal “laws of human behavior” but they are viewpoint 
dependent
e.g. social status, cultural differences

Sampling  and generalisation
•
•

sampling methods of participants are only part of the problem
introspectionism (research at researcher as participant) was replaced by behaviourism in 
the 20th century
single case studies for rare cases = applying the independent variable at different random
points in time
ideal sample size: precision against variability 
differences for study purpose (medical, training, pilot, etc)
for averaging values with low error margin: more participants=better precision
to find out relations/correlation fewer participants suffice
convenience sample: (easy to get, e.g. students) acceptable for finding a relation
however the representativeness is discussed, dependent on research subject
difference between population of interest and sample
participant rates can be very low
random selection does not necessarily result in a random sample

Statistics and generalisation
•
•

crucial: significant testing and size of trend,relationship,..
significant testing can overlook trends or make appear trends where there are none

Chance findings and statistical significance
•
•

bigger effects are more likely to be significant → larger sample size 
significance: 5%= 0.5 or less that an effect of that size as found by the specific research 
is found by chance, “insignificance” not the term for the opposite, but “ non-
significance”
small trends found in very large samples are likely not to generalise to small samples

•

alternative value of significance level: stricter 0.001 if this is required for the study

•
• Bonferroni adjustment for comparing several groups with overall significance level 0.5 

→ set value for each comparison to 0.17
for pilot studies: general trend important: 0.1

Directional and non directional hypotheses
•

directional hypotheses require ignorance of the data and a strong evidence why the trend 
is expected to go in one direction or replicating an experiment
directional hypothesis is supported by weaker data than would be required by the non-
directional hypothesis →  two tailed (2* 0.25%) and one tailed (1*0.5%) testings
if the trend goes in opposite direction: reject hypothesis because opposite effect must be 
chance finding
try to avoid directional testing

One versus Two-tailed
•

standard deviation: sort of average of the amount scores in a sample differ from the 
mean of the sample.
Standard error: sort of measure of the variation of sample means drawn from the 
population defined by the null hypothesis, tells us how likely each of the different 
sample means are, the distribution of sample means
If the null hypothesis is true, then samples that are unlike what would be expected on the
basis of this null hypothesis are likely to be uncommon.

Similaritiy between measures of effect and association
•
•

often t-test and Pearson correlation coefficient 
t  -test based on comparing the means of two samples, examines the size of the difference 
between the two means relative to the variability in the data. 

• The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) is a measure of the amount of  relationship 

between two variables
related testings

• To be statistically significant at the two-tailed .05 level, the t value has to be 2.00 or 

bigger for samples of more than 61 cases, less for bigger samples but 1,96 for infinite 
samples

• Bigger values of t generally indicate a bigger effect
•

Pearson’s correlation shows the size of an association between two quantitative variables
