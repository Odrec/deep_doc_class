Introduction

negation and downward monotonicity

Metalinguistic negation

Conclusion

Logical negation

All of us know when and how to use negative expressions, but what
is the unconscious linguistic knowledge that we have about them?

FOL: ¬, ¬¬p = p

(cid:74)not(cid:75) (cid:32) λp.¬p, i.e. sentence negation denotes a function

from a proposition to a proposition and thus has the semantic
type of < t, t >.
