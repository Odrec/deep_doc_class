Choosing not to act, or the ability to intentionally inhibit your actions lies at the core of
self-control. Even though most research has focused on externally primed inhibition, an
important question concerns how intentional inhibition develops. Therefore, in the present
study children (aged 10–12) and adults (aged 18–26) performed the marble task, in which
they had to choose between acting on and inhibiting a prepotent response, while fMRI data
were collected. Intentional inhibition was associated with activation of the fronto-basal
ganglia network. Activation in the subthalamic nucleus and dorsal fronto-median cortex,
regions which have previously been associated with intentional inhibition, did not dif-
fer between intentional inhibition and intentional action. Even though both children and
adults intentionally inhibited their actions to a similar extent, children showed more acti-
vation in the fronto-basal ganglia network during intentional inhibition, but not in the
subthalamic nucleus and dorsal fronto-median cortex. Furthermore, a positive relation
between self-reported impulsivity and intentional inhibition was observed. These ﬁnd-
ings have important implications for our understanding of disorders of impulsivity, such as
ADHD, which are associated with poor self-control abilities.

1. Introduction

Self-control abilities are of critical

importance for
successful functioning across the life span. A classical
experiment to test self-control is the marshmallow exper-
iment, a delay of gratiﬁcation test for preschool children
in which children can choose between one marshmallow
now or two marshmallows later (Mischel et al., 1989).

Studies with the marshmallow experiment have shown
that during the preschool ages there are large individual
differences in the ability to control the immediate impulse
to eat the ﬁrst marshmallow and wait for the second
marshmallow (Mischel et al., 1989) and experimental vari-
ations of this task have shown a developmental increase
in controlling immediate impulses between childhood
and adulthood (Christakou et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2013;
Scheres et al., 2006). These changes are accompanied by
neurodevelopmental changes. Recently, it has been shown
that individuals who were less able to delay gratiﬁcation
when they were preschoolers, showed poorer self-control
and reduced recruitment of the fronto-basal ganglia
network during a response inhibition task in adulthood
(Casey et al., 2011).

An important distinction which has been made in tasks
that involve self-control, is whether the inhibitory pro-
cess is externally or internally driven. Externally driven
response inhibition involves the ability to interrupt an
action when signaled by a cue in the environment, for
example, a trafﬁc light which turns red. Neuroscientiﬁc
studies have shown that the fronto-basal ganglia network,
with main nodes in right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG), stri-
atum, globus pallidus, and subthalamic nucleus (STN), is
consistently involved during externally driven response
inhibition (e.g. Aron et al., 2007; Aron and Poldrack, 2006;
Forstmann et al., 2012; Jahfari et al., 2011; King et al., 2012).
Developmental studies have also found evidence for the
involvement of the fronto-basal ganglia network in exter-
nally driven response inhibition in children (Cohen et al.,
2010; Ordaz et al., 2013). So far, most developmental neu-
roimaging studies have focused on the frontal component
of the fronto-basal ganglia network, namely the rIFG (Luna
et al., 2010). These studies have reported both increases
(e.g. Ordaz et al., 2013; Rubia et al., 2007) and decreases
(e.g. Booth et al., 2003; Durston et al., 2002) in inhibi-
tion related rIFG activation with age, but an age-related
increase in rIFG activation and a decrease in activation in
task-unspeciﬁc frontal regions appears to be the most com-
mon pattern (Crone & Dahl, 2012; Durston et al., 2006; Luna
et al., 2010). Overall, these studies show a stabilization of
response inhibition performance and its underlying neural
correlates during adolescence (Luna et al., 2010).

A second, but understudied component of self-control
is intentional inhibition. In daily life often both external
cues and internal processes play a role in the decision to
inhibit, although sometimes external cues are more impor-
tant (such as when stopping at a trafﬁc light) and other
times internal processes are more prominent (such as when
inhibiting yourself from taking another piece of chocolate).
However, in contrast to externally driven inhibition, inten-
tional inhibition is not triggered by an external cue. Instead,
intentional inhibition has been deﬁned as a late internally
driven veto process, a ﬁnal opportunity to inhibit before
action execution (Brass and Haggard, 2008; Filevich et al.,
2012; Haggard, 2008). Since intentional inhibition is not
preceded by any external stimulus, and does not result in
any overt behavior, intentional inhibition has proven difﬁ-
cult to investigate. Yet, this type of inhibition is involved in
many of our day to day activities such as inhibiting yourself
from taking another piece of chocolate, inhibiting press-
ing the send button when being on the verge of sending
an angry email, or inhibiting scratching itchy skin caused
by eczema. Delay of gratiﬁcation studies have reported
developmental improvements in the ability to intention-
ally inhibit the impulse to choose an immediate reward
(Christakou et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2013; Scheres et al.,
2006), but these tasks involve many different processes
besides intentional inhibition, such as reward sensitiv-
ity and reward discounting. A neuroscience perspective
can provide important insights into the development of
intentional inhibition, as this provides a covert measure
of a process, which occurs without a speciﬁc stimulus and
without any behavioral outcomes. An important question
concerns whether intentional inhibition is guided by the
same neural network as externally driven inhibition, or

whether intentional inhibition is associated with differ-
ent underlying neural circuitry, which may develop during
child and adolescent development.

In the present study, we used the child-friendly marble
paradigm to examine the neural correlates of intentional
action and inhibition in children. In this paradigm partic-
ipants are instructed to freely decide between responding
and inhibiting responding to a rolling marble. Children
between 10 and 12 years of age were included to allow for
comparison of the results to the externally driven response
inhibition literature (Booth et al., 2003; Bunge et al., 2002;
Durston et al., 2002; Rubia et al., 2007). Based on these prior
ﬁndings, we expect to observe activation in the main nodes
of the fronto-basal ganglia network (i.e. rIFG, striatum,
globus pallidus, and STN) during intentional inhibition,
comparable to what we have observed in adults (Schel
et al., 2014). If developmental differences in internally
driven inhibition share mechanisms with externally driven
response inhibition (Bunge et al., 2002; Durston et al., 2002;
Luna et al., 2010), then we may expect inhibition-related
activation in the rIFG to be stronger for adults compared to
children.

Recently, several studies have suggested that inten-
tional inhibition is associated with increased activation in
the dorsal fronto-median cortex (dFMC) (Brass & Haggard,
2007; Kühn et al., 2009), a region which was previously
found to be more active in early adolescents when inhibi-
ting a selﬁsh impulse in a sharing task (van den Bos et al.,
2011). Therefore, we examined whether more activity in
the dFMC during intentional inhibition was observed in
children compared to adults based on prior studies show-
ing that this region is more active in 10–12-year-olds
(Blakemore, 2008; Gunther Moor et al., 2012; van den Bos
et al., 2011).

In order to validate our experimental measure of inten-
tional inhibition, participants also completed the Barratt
Impulsiveness Scale (Patton et al., 1995) outside of the
scanner to obtain an estimate of impulsivity and self-
control in daily life. We expect daily life impulsivity to be
predictive of intentional action control performance.

2. Methods

2.1. Participants

Nineteen healthy right-handed children between 10
and 12 years of age (10 females, M = 11.56, SD = .83) and
twenty-four healthy right-handed adults between 18 and
26 years of age (13 females, M = 21.49, SD = 2.36) par-
ticipated in the experiment. The results from the adults
have previously been published in a larger report on
response inhibition (Schel et al., 2014). A chi-square test
revealed no signiﬁcant differences in gender distributions
between age groups (p = .92). All participants had normal
or corrected-to-normal vision, and no neurological or psy-
chiatric impairments according to self- or parent-report.
Informed consent was obtained for all participants and
the study was approved by the Internal Review Board
at Leiden University Medical Center. In accordance with
the guidelines of the Leiden University Medical Center,

all anatomical scans were reviewed by a radiologist. No
anomalous ﬁndings were reported.

To obtain an estimate of cognitive functioning, chil-
dren and adults completed the subtests similarities and
block design of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Chil-
dren (WISC) (Wechsler, 1981b) and the Wechsler Adult
Intelligence Scale (WAIS) (Wechsler, 1981a) respectively.
Estimated IQ scores were within the normal range (chil-
dren: M = 111.32, SD = 9.94, adults: M = 111.33, SD = 6.93)
and age groups did not differ in estimated IQ scores, F
(1,42) = .00, p = .99, 2 = 1.04−6.

2.2. Task

The marble task was adapted from Kühn et al. (2009).
Each trial (see Fig. 1) started with the presentation of a
ﬁxation screen (white cross against a black background)
with duration jittered between 1400 and 2000 ms. The ﬁx-
ation screen was followed by a screen showing a white
ramp with a white marble on top presented against black
background. After a variable duration of 1400–2000 ms
the marble started rolling down the ramp and partici-
pants could stop the marble from crashing by pressing
a button. Finally, a feedback screen, showing trial out-
come, was presented for 1000 milliseconds. There were
two task conditions: a green marble and a white marble
condition.

In the green marble condition, the white marble
changed to green as soon as it started rolling. The task
was programmed in such a way that participants viewed
16 rapidly presented static pictures showing the marble at
successive locations on the ramp, which was experienced
as a rolling movement. Participants were instructed to stop
the marble from crashing by pressing a response button
with their right index ﬁnger. When participants were suc-
cessful at stopping the marble, they were presented with
a feedback screen showing the location where they had
stopped the marble. When participants were not success-
ful at stopping the marble, they were presented with a
feedback screen showing a shattered marble beneath the
ramp. The speed of the marble was adjusted by a staircase-
tracking procedure. At the start of the experiment, the static
pictures were presented for 30 milliseconds each. When
participants were successful at stopping the marble the
duration was decreased with 10 milliseconds, making the
task more difﬁcult. When participants were not successful
at stopping the marble in time the duration was increased
with 10 milliseconds, making the task easier. The staircase
procedure was allowed to ﬂuctuate between 20 and 80 mil-
liseconds, allowing a response window between 320 and
1280 milliseconds.

In the white marble condition, the marble did not
change color and participants were instructed to choose
between responding and inhibiting. When participants
responded, they were presented with a feedback screen
showing the location where they had stopped the marble.
When participants inhibited, they were shown a feedback
screen showing the white marble at the bottom of the
ramp. In order to motivate participants to balance the
frequency of responding and inhibiting, they were told
that the stopped and non-stopped marbles would fall in

different baskets. Participants were instructed to collect
an equal amount of marbles in each basket, but were not
allowed to count or use a sequencing strategy; therefore,
participants were instructed to make an independent
decision every time the marble stayed white. At the
end of each block participants were shown how many
marbles they had collected in each basket. As will be
described in the results section, the participants were
successful in following the instruction to stop the marble
on approximately 50% of the trials.

In order to give participants sufﬁcient time to decide
between responding and inhibiting the speed of the white
marble rolling down the ramp was set considerably slower.
The speed of the sequentially presented static white marble
pictures was set to the speed currently reached in the green
marble condition plus 30 milliseconds. Consequently the
duration of the sequentially presented static white marble
pictures was allowed to ﬂuctuate between 50 and 110 mil-
liseconds, allowing a response window between 800 and
1760 milliseconds.

The experiment consisted of three blocks of 80 trials,
each block consisting of 48 green and 32 white marble tri-
als. Trials were presented in a pseudo-randomized order
so that each white marble trial was preceded by 0, 1, 2, or
3 green marble trials. The large proportion of green trials
served two functions. First, the green trials lead to a pre-
potent tendency for action. Since the green marble trials
were rather difﬁcult, participants had to remain focused
on the goal of responding quickly to the rolling marble,
thus increasing the prepotency of responding. Also, due
to the intermixed presentation of green and white trials
participants could not predict when a white trial would
be presented. Therefore participants had to be prepared to
quickly respond to a green marble during the whole dura-
tion of the experiment, leaving the prepotency intact. This
was desirable, so that intentional inhibition of action would
involve a late brake on an already-prepared action, rather
than a decision not to initiate action preparation. Second,
the randomized interleaving of intentional (white) and
instructed (green) trials also discouraged participants from
strategically pre-deciding a pattern of intentional action,
such as act-inhibit-act-inhibit, etc.

2.3. Barratt Impulsiveness Scale

Following the scanning session participants completed
the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) (Patton et al.,
1995). The BIS-11 is a measure of impulsive traits consisting
of three subscales: motor impulsivity (‘I act without think-
ing’), non-planning impulsivity (‘I’m not interested in the
future, but in today’), and attentional impulsivity (‘I have
difﬁculties sitting still during lectures’). For the child partic-
ipants the questions were rephrased in an age-appropriate
style (e.g. ‘I have difﬁculties sitting still in the classroom’
instead of ‘I have difﬁculties sitting still during lectures’).

2.4. Data acquisition

Scanning was performed with a standard whole-head
coil on a 3.0 Tesla Philips scanner at the Leiden Uni-
versity Medical Center. The marble task consisted of

Fig. 1. Trial structure of the marble task. Stimuli were presented at a black background. At the beginning of each trial a white marble on top of a ramp was
presented. After a variable delay (jittered between 1400 and 2000 ms) the marble started to roll down the ramp, and could change color to green.

3 event-related runs, each lasting approximately 6 min.
Functional data were acquired using T2*-weighted echo-
planar imaging (EPI). The ﬁrst 2 volumes of each run were
discarded in order to allow for equilibration of T1 satura-
tion effects (TR = 2.2 s, TE = 30 ms, sequential acquisition, 38
slices of 2.75 mm, ﬁeld of view 220 mm, 80× 80 matrix,
in-plane resolution 2.75 mm). After the functional runs a
high-resolution 3D T1-FFE scan for anatomical reference
was obtained (TR = 9.760 ms; TE = 4.59 ms, ﬂip angle = 8
degrees, 140 slices, 0.875× 0.875× 1.2 mm3 voxels, ﬁeld of
view = 224× 168× 177 mm3). Head motion was restricted
by using foam inserts between the head and the head coil.
Visual stimuli were projected onto a screen in the magnet
bore that could be viewed through a mirror attached to the
head coil.

2.5. Behavioral data analysis

The use of response selection strategies on the mar-
ble task was evaluated by computing the Random Number
Generation 2 (RNG2) index using Towse and Neil’s (1998)
RgCalc program. The RNG2 index is an adaptation of
the RNG index (Evans, 1978) optimized for two-choice
response sequences, which considers the randomness of
the sequence (Neuringer, 1986). Scores can range from 0
(no predictability) to 1 (complete predictability).

2.6.

fMRI data analysis

Data were preprocessed using SPM8 (Welcome Depart-
ment of Cognitive Neurology, London).
Images were
corrected for rigid-body motion. Translational movement
did not exceed 1 voxel (<3 mm) and mean movement
did not differ between age groups, F (1, 42) = .043, p = .84,
2 = .001. Structural and functional volumes were spatially
normalized to T1 templates. The normalization algo-
rithm used a 12-parameter afﬁne nonlinear transformation
involving cosine basis functions, and then resampled the
volumes to 3-mm cubic voxels. Templates were based on
the MNI305 stereotaxic space (Cocosco et al., 1997), an
approximation of Talairach space (Talairach and Tournoux,
1988). Functional volumes were spatially smoothed with
an 8-mm full-width-at-half-maximum isotropic Gaussian
kernel. Statistical analyses were performed on individual
participants’ data using the general linear model in SPM8.
The fMRI time series data were modeled by a series of
events convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response
function (HRF) and the temporal derivatives. The onset of
marble motion of each trial was modeled as an event of
interest. Separate regressors were deﬁned for white nogo
(intentional inhibibition), white go (intentional action),
green go (externally guided action), and green omissions
(omission on the green marble trials). The trial functions

M.A. Schel et al. / Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience 10 (2014) 93–103

97

were used as covariates in a general linear model, along
with a basic set of cosine functions to high-pass ﬁlter
(120 Hz) the data. The least-squares parameter estimates
of the height of the best-ﬁtting canonical HRF for the
different conditions were used in pairwise contrasts. All
reported effects consisted of at least 10 contiguous vox-
els that exceeded a false-discovery-rate (FDR) corrected
threshold of p < .05, unless otherwise speciﬁed.

Region of interest (ROI) analyses were performed to fur-
ther characterize the involvement of brain regions in the
development of intentional inhibition. ROI analyses were
performed with the MarsBaR toolbox in SPM8 (Brett et al.,
2002) (http://marsbar.sourceforge.net). ROIs that spanned
several anatomical regions were masked with marsbar-aal
ROIs. For rSTN, ROI analyses were performed on an anatom-
ical rSTN template derived from a study using ultrahigh 7
Tesla scanning (Forstmann et al., 2010). For dFMC, ROI anal-
yses were performed on a 6 mm radius sphere centered on
−7, 42, 21 (Kühn et al., 2009).

3. Results

3.1. Behavior

The ﬁrst comparison looked at performance on the
instructed green marble trials. The staircase-tracking pro-
cedure for green marble trials was overall successful,
showing that participants responded in time on 60.63%
of the trials (SD = 7.06). However, despite the tracking,
adults (M = 63.22, SD = 7.18) were more successful at res-
ponding to the green marble in time compared to children
(M = 57, 35, SD = 5.49), F (1,42) = 8.68, p < .01, 2 = .17 (see
Fig. 2A). Second, we examined the choice behavior on
the intentional white marble trials. As instructed, partic-
ipants decided to inhibit responding to the white marble
on approximately 50% of the trials (children: M = 40.73,
SD = 10.03; adults: M = 46.83, SD = 8.00). However, as can be
seen in Fig. 2A children more often responded to the white
marble compared to adults, F (1,42) = 4.92, p < .05, 2 = .11.
To examine the use of response selection strategies the
RNG2 index was computed. A mean RNG2 index of .81
(SD = .01) was observed. To examine the randomness of the
participants’ choice behavior, the participants’ RNG2 index
was compared with a RNG2 index computed over a set of
randomly generated sequences of go- and nogo-responses.
For the randomly generated set of go- and nogo-response
sequences a mean RNG2 index of .801 (SD = .002) was
observed. Although the RNG2 index for the randomly gen-
erated sequences was marginally but signiﬁcantly smaller
compared to the participants’ RNG2 index, F (1, 66) = 18.90,
p < .001, 2 = .22, these results indicate that the participants’
behavior was close to being random and not driven by sim-
ple alternation strategies. Children and adults did not differ
in RNG2 index, F (1,42) = 1.20, p = .28, 2 = .03, indicating
that children and adults did not differ in use of strategies
for deciding between responding and inhibiting.

Next, we examined whether there were differences in
response times to the instructed green and intentional
white marble trials. As expected, reaction times on the
green trials were shorter compared to the white trials,
F (1,41) = 60.79, p < .001, 2 = .60 (see Fig. 2B), indicating

that the decision process on the white trials took more
time. No main, F (1, 41) = .84, p = .37, 2 = .02, or interaction,
F (1,41) = 1.47, p = .23, 2 = .04, effects of age group were
observed.

No developmental differences in self-reported impuls-
ivity on the BIS-11 were observed (all p’s > .1) (see
Table 1). However, correlation patterns between self-
reported impulsivity and performance on the marble task
differed between age groups. First, adults who reported
more motor impulsivity, more often chose to inhibit,
r = .409, p < .05, but for children this correlation was not
signiﬁcant, r =−.084, p = .73 (see Fig. 3A). However, a
comparison between the correlations showed that the
correlations for adults and children did not differ signiﬁ-
cantly from each other, z = 1.06, p = .28. Second, adults who
reported more non-planning impulsivity, more often chose
to inhibit, r = .508, p < .05, but for children this correla-
tion was not signiﬁcant, r =−.331, p = .17 (see Fig. 3B). A
comparison between the correlations showed that the cor-
relations for adults and children differed signiﬁcantly from
each other, z = 2.72, p < .01, showing that the correlation
was present in adults but not in children. No correla-
tions between self-reported attentional impulsivity and
task performance were observed (all p’s > .05).

3.2.

fMRI

To identify the brain regions involved in intentional
inhibition, the contrast intentional inhibition > intentional
action (White NoGo > White Go) was computed for the
whole group (N = 43). This analysis revealed activation in a
fronto-basal ganglia network, including bilateral IFG, bilat-
eral striatum, and occipital lobe, but not in the STN and
the dFMC (see Fig. 4, and Supplementary Table 1 for the
MNI coordinates of peak values). A two-sample t-test on
the whole brain level revealed no developmental differ-
ences on the contrast intentional inhibition > intentional
action (White NoGo > White Go). To further examine the
involvement of the fronto-basal ganglia network in inten-
tional inhibition across development, ROI analyses were
performed for the rIFG, right putamen, right caudate, and
right globus pallidus.1 ROI analyses average across a set of
voxels and therefore have more power to detect changes
in a priori selected areas.

For rIFG no main effect of age group was observed F
(1, 41) = .29, p = .59, 2 = .01. However, there was a trend
for an age group × condition interaction, F (1,41) = 3.71,
p = .061, 2 = .08, indicating that children showed signif-
icantly more rIFG activation for intentional
inhibition
compared to intentional action, F (1,18) = 25.21, p < .001,

1 Here we only report right hemisphere ROIs in line with previous
response inhibition literature. However, for the left hemisphere ROIs sim-
ilar results were found.

2 = .0 = 58, whereas adults did not, F (1,23) = 2.05, p = .17,
2 = .08 (see Fig. 5).

In the right putamen no main effect of age group
was observed, F (1,41) = .91, p = .35, 2 = .02. However, an
age group × condition interaction, F (1,41) = 6.92, p < .05,
2 = .14, indicated that the activation difference between
intentional inhibition and intentional action in right puta-
men was larger for children, F (1,18) = 29.93, p < .001,
2 = .62, than for adults, F (1,23) = 4.03, p = .057, 2 = .15 (see
Fig. 5).

For right caudate there was a main effect of age group,
showing that children had more stimulus related deacti-
vation compared to adults, F (1,41) = 18.09, p < .05, 2 = .10
(see Fig. 5). However, no age group × condition interaction
was observed, F (1,41) = 2.25, p = .14, 2 = .05.

For right globus pullidus no main effect of age group
was observed, F (1,41) = .38, p = .54, 2 = .01. However,
an age group × condition interaction, F (1,41) = 7.28,

more right globus pallidus activation during intentional

However, when looking at the intentional inhibition deci-

clear bilateral STN activation was observed for both
intentional inhibition and intentional action (see Fig. 6,
and Supplementary Table 2 for the MNI coordinates of

the intentional
inhibition and action processes across
development a ROI analysis was performed for right

No dFMC activation during intentional inhibition was
observed in the contrast intentional inhibition > intentional

indeed were no differences in dFMC activation, a ROI anal-
ysis was performed for dFMC. This analysis showed that
dFMC activation did not differ between intentional inhi-
bition (White NoGo) and intentional action (White Go),
F (1,41) = .43, p = .52, 2 = .01. Also, no main, F (1,41) = .12,

whole brain regression analyses on the contrast White

4. Discussion

The present study examined the neural correlates of an
important component of self-control; namely intentional
inhibition, in children and adults. We used the marble task
previously developed by Kühn et al. (2009) to test the
neural correlates associated with responding to a rolling
marble versus withholding responding to a rolling mar-
ble, where the latter process requires intentional inhibition
of a prepotent response. As predicted, children and adults
showed different recruitment of the fronto-basal ganglia
network during intentional inhibition. However, no effects
were observed in the dFMC, suggesting that differences are
attributable to a similar process as what previously has
been observed for externally guided inhibition (see Luna
et al., 2010 for a review).

Prior studies have reported that there is a develop-
mental change in inhibitory performance when the task
involves external cues (Luna et al., 2010), but much less
is known about developmental differences when inhibi-
tion is internally driven. The ﬁrst question we addressed
was therefore whether children were able to withhold res-
ponding when they had to freely decide to do so. On a
behavioral level we show an early development of inten-
tional inhibition performance. That is to say, children
intentionally inhibited responding to the rolling marble on
approximately 50% of the trials. Also, our RNG2 results indi-
cate that children as well as adults did not use strategies to
choose between inhibiting and acting. These ﬁndings are
in line with our previous studies in which we have shown
mature performance levels on intentional inhibition tasks
in late childhood/early adolescence on similar tasks (Schel
and Crone, 2013; Schel et al., 2013).

Even though both children and adults inhibited respon-
ding to the marble on approximately 50% of the trials, it
is possible that developmental differences occur in neu-
ral responses to intentional inhibition demands, which is
potentially a more sensitive index than deciding whether

were observed at the FDR corrected threshold. However,
for non-planning impulsivity a signiﬁcant relationship
with intentional inhibition related brain activation in the
left putamen was observed at an uncorrected threshold
(p < .001, at least 10 contiguous voxels), such that par-
ticipants who reported more impulsivity showed more
activation in left putamen during intentional inhibition
(see Fig. 7). A ROI analysis of this left putamen region
showed a signiﬁcant positive correlation in adults, r = .600,
p < .005, but for children this correlation was not signiﬁ-
cant, r = .368, p = .12. However, the correlations for adults
and children did not differ signiﬁcantly from each other,
z = .93, p = .35. No relationships between motor and atten-
tional impulsivity and intentional inhibition related brain
activation were found.

to press the button or not. Therefore, we examined the
involvement of the fronto-basal ganglia network in inten-
tional inhibition in children and adults. We show that the
fronto-basal ganglia network, which is well known for its
involvement in externally driven response inhibition (Aron
et al., 2007; Aron and Poldrack, 2006; Jahfari et al., 2011)
is activated during both intentional inhibition and inten-
tional action. Although the fronto-basal ganglia network
was activated for both intentional inhibition and inten-
tional action, activation in most nodes of the network (i.e.
rIFG, right putamen and right globus pallidus) was larger
for intentional inhibition. Thus the fronto-basal ganlia net-
work appears to be important for inhibition, irrespective
of how inhibition was triggered (externally or internally
driven) (see also Schel et al., 2014).

Although there were no developmental differences on
the behavioral level, we observed differential recruitment
of the fronto-basal ganglia network such that children
showed more activation for intentional inhibition com-
pared to intentional action, whereas for adults activation
did not differ between intentional inhibition and inten-
tional action. Thus, it appears that children show increased
recruitment of the fronto-basal ganglia network during
intentional inhibition to reach adult performance levels.
The pattern of trend-level increased activation in rIFG and
increased activation in putamen during intentional inhibi-
tion in children compared to adults is consistent with some
studies on externally driven response inhibition (Casey
et al., 2002), but not with others which have reported
less recruitment of rIFG and instead compensatory recruit-
ment in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Bunge et al., 2002;
Durston et al., 2002; Luna et al., 2010). In this study, we do
not ﬁnd compensatory recruitment for children outside the
fronto-basal ganglia network. Thus, children already acti-
vate the same network as adults, but to a different extent.
One explanation for this pattern of results might be that
for adults acting and inhibiting are two equal response
options, whereas for children acting is the default response.
Therefore, overruling this default response in order to
intentionally inhibit, might require increased recruitment
of the fronto-basal ganglia network.

One notable ﬁnding was that the STN was not more
active for intentional inhibition, even though it has been
consistently reported as an important region for externally
driven inhibition. However, additional analyses showed
that the STN, which is conceptualized as a main inhibitory
node in the fronto-basal ganglia network for inhibition, was
equally activated for intentional inhibition and intentional
action. These ﬁndings corroborate the conceptualization of
response inhibition and response selection as “two sides of
the same coin” of Mostofsky and Simmonds (2008). Inhibi-
tion and action can be seen as two equal response options,
which are supported by a similar neural network (Karch
et al., 2009; Mostofsky and Simmonds, 2008).

Finally, we show that individual differences in self-
reported impulsivity are predictive of intentional inhibi-
tion performance and the underlying neural correlates.
Interestingly, the results of our exploratory analyses into
the relation between self-reported impulsivity and inten-
tional inhibition show that people who are more impulsive
more often chose to inhibit. Also, they showed more

activation in the left putamen during intentional inhibi-
tion (note that these results are based on an uncorrected
threshold of .001, >10 contiguous voxels). This is oppo-
site to the relation observed between impulsivity and
externally driven response inhibition; there more impuls-
ivity is predictive of worse inhibitory performance (Casey
et al., 2011). The positive relation between self-reported
impulsivity and intentional inhibition could suggest that
impulsivity is not always a negative trait. When provided
with a choice, impulsive people are well able to choose
to inhibit. Thus, acting does not always appear to be the
default choice. However, it should be noted that in the cur-
rent study, the choice between inhibition and action was
made in a relatively neutral context (i.e. there were no con-
sequences depending on either choice). In daily life, this is
often not the case. There the choice between inhibition and
action is almost always inﬂuenced by motivational factors
like loss, reward or punishment (Leotti and Wager, 2010).
How impulsivity inﬂuences intentional inhibition in those
circumstances remains an important question for future
research.

A continuing debate in research on intentional inhibi-
tion is the role of the dFMC. Some studies, including the
study by Kühn et al. (2009), which also used the marble
paradigm, have shown that the late veto of a response is
associated with more activity in the dFMC. This has been
interpreted as a role of this area in the voluntary control
of an action (i.e., the “whether” decision in action control)
(Brass and Haggard, 2008; Haggard, 2008). Several other
studies have conﬁrmed that this region is more active in
other paradigms on intentional inhibition, such as choos-
ing not to gamble (Campbell-Meiklejohn et al., 2008) or
inhibition of cigarette cravings (Brody et al., 2007). How-
ever, not all studies can replicate this effect, for example, in
a prior study in adults we observed dFMC activation only
under speciﬁc preceding context conditions (Schel et al.,
2014). In the current study, we found no evidence for dFMC
activation in children, suggesting that neural differences
are only observed in the network which is also engaged by
externally triggered inhibition.

Some limitations of the present study deserve mention-
ing. First, we only included a selected age-range (10–12
year-olds and 18–26 year-olds) in the present study. Future
studies should include participants across the whole age
range from early childhood to adulthood, to examine
whether there are speciﬁc developmental periods during
which intentional inhibition is most sensitive to develop-
mental change (see also: Schel and Crone, 2013). Second,
we cannot completely rule out the possibility that partic-
ipants might have pre-decided not to initiate an action,
instead of canceling a prepared action at the last moment
on the intentional inhibition trials. However, the fast paced
and unpredictable nature of the task, made it very difﬁcult
to pre-decide. In future research electromyography meas-
ures might be included, to make sure that initial action
preparation is also present on intentional inhibition trials.
Third, since the present study did not have an externally
guided inhibition condition, we could not directly compare
the development of intentional versus externally driven
inhibition. Follow-up studies should include an externally
driven inhibition condition to be able to directly compare

102

intentional and externally driven inhibition. Fourth, the
present study used the relatively neutral marble task, in
which there are no strong internal motivations for action.
An interesting avenue for future research might be to
include a strong affective or motivational component, such
as is the case in the marshmallow paradigm (Mischel et al.,
1989). This might be especially interesting for research in
adolescence, when there is a sensitivity towards rewards
(Somerville et al., 2011). Fifth, although the role of the rIFG
is typically interpreted in terms of response inhibition (for
a review, see Ridderinkhof et al., 2011), alternative con-
ceptualizations in terms of action selection have also been
proposed (Verbruggen et al., 2010). While the present study
does not allow to distinguish the role of rIFG with respect
to those alternatives, they may be reconciled by pointing
to the role of rIFG in overriding one response alternative
(here, to act) in favor of another (here, to inhibit).

To conclude, the present study was the ﬁrst to examine
the neural correlates of intentional inhibition in children
and adults. Although children performed at adult level,
children showed increased recruitment of the fronto-basal
ganglia network during intentional inhibition. Individual
differences in impulsivity were predictive of intentional
inhibition, more impulsive people were more likely to
choose to inhibit. This research has implications for
research into disorders of impulsivity, such as ADHD,
which are currently associated with poor self-control abil-
ities (Scheres et al., 2006, 2010). Many types of impulsive
behaviors, which are typical for children and adults with
disorders of impulsivity, require an intentional decision to
inhibit, given that external cues are not always available.
