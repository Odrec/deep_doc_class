Abstract

Defining the mutational landscape when individuals of a species grow separately and diverge over many generations can
provide insights into trait evolution. A specific example of this involves studying changes associated with domestication
where different lines of the same wild stock have been cultivated independently in different standard environments. Whole
genome sequence comparison of such lines permits estimation of mutation rates, inference of genes’ ancestral states and
ancestry of existing strains, and correction of sequencing errors in genome databases. Here we study domestication of the
C. elegans Bristol strain as a model, and report the genome sequence of LSJ1 (Bristol), a sibling of the standard C. elegans
reference wild type N2 (Bristol). The LSJ1 and N2 lines were cultivated separately from shortly after the Bristol strain was
isolated until methods to freeze C. elegans were developed. We find that during this time the two strains have accumulated
1208 genetic differences. We describe phenotypic variation between N2 and LSJ1 in the rate at which embryos develop, the
rate of production of eggs, the maturity of eggs at laying, and feeding behavior, all the result of post-isolation changes. We
infer the ancestral alleles in the original Bristol
isolate and highlight 2038 likely sequencing errors in the original N2
reference genome sequence. Many of these changes modify genome annotation. Our study provides a starting point to
further investigate genotype-phenotype association and offers insights into the process of selection as a result of laboratory
domestication.

Introduction

Selective breeding during domestication can lead to rapid and
dramatic changes in phenotype [1]. Understanding domestication
is important both because it can link phenotypic selection with
genetic change, and because it has been central to human success
[2,3]. Laboratory strains of model organisms are unusual examples
of domestication in which extensive inbreeding has maximized
phenotypic uniformity and artificial selection has been used to
improve laboratory handling [4–6]. Inbred lab strains often
exhibit significant phenotypic differences from wild isolates of the
same species. For example, olfactory responses of lab strains of
Drosophila differ from those of recently caught wild strains [7]. Lab-
adapted mouse strains show reduced exploratory behavior [8],
agility and strength [9], and risk aversion [10] compared to wild
caught mice. However, the consequences of laboratory domesti-
cation have not been systematically investigated in any animal.

laboratory studies of

With a few exceptions [11–16],

the
nematode C. elegans have used the same wild type reference strain:
N2 (Bristol). The progenitor of this strain was collected in Bristol,
England, sometime before 1956 by L.N. Staniland [17,18]. E.
Dougherty took its descendants to California, where two stocks of
the strain were maintained from 1956 by serial transfer, one in
axenic liquid culture and the other on nutrient agar inoculated

with E. coli [17]. In 1964, Dougherty sent Sydney Brenner at the
MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology one of these C. elegans sub-
strains. Brenner used this
stock to establish the laboratory
reference C. elegans wild strain, which he called N2 (Bristol). At
the MRC, N2 was maintained on agar plates with an E. coli food
source until c. 1970, when the strain was frozen (Figure 1a).

The sibling stock of the Bristol isolate that was cultivated in
axenic liquid culture appears to have also survived, and is called
LSJ1(Berkeley) [16]. Here we refer to it as LSJ1(Bristol) to indicate
its origins. Distinct growth conditions and inadvertent selective
breeding are likely to have exposed the N2 and LSJ1 sub-cultures
to different selective pressures. Additionally, both strains likely
experienced genetic bottlenecks, with associated founder affects,
prior to freezing. Comparing the genomes of N2 and LSJ1 Bristol
strains would highlight genetic changes associated with lab
domestication as well as errors in the C. elegans reference genome.
The ancestral and derived alleles at each polymorphic locus could
also be established by comparing the genomes of Bristol-derived
strains and of other wild C. elegans isolates.

One striking difference between N2 and most other wild C.
elegans isolates is in foraging [11]. N2 feeds alone, whereas most
wild isolates feed in groups [11,15]. Dimorphism in foraging is
associated with two alleles of the neuropeptide receptor npr-1 that
differ at codon 215. Aggregating strains encode the ancestral npr-1

215F allele whereas N2 encodes npr-1 215V [11,19]. Twelve other
wild isolates that are genetically closely related to N2 also show
solitary behavior and encode npr-1 215V, which would be
consistent with recent occurrence of the polymorphism in wild

populations. Surprisingly however, the LSJ1 strain feeds in groups
and encodes the npr-1 215F allele, which would suggest that the
npr-1 215V allele arose during laboratory domestication of N2
[13,20]. These conflicting data suggest two hypotheses: that the 12
