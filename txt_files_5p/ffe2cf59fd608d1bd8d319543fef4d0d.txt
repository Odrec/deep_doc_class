CHARACTER OF THE EMOTIONS

HEIDEGGER: BEFINDLICHKEIT

Befindlichkeit

- “sich befinden”
- We are always in some affective state
- Befindlichkeit is not a disruptive occurrence, but an ever-

present and, moreover, all-permeating phenomenon

- Difference between episodic emotions and moods; but the 

difference is not that moods are not directed at 
something while emotions are!

HEIDEGGER: BEFINDLICHKEIT

- The term Befindlichkeit covers both

- Moods
- Object-specific emotions

- Object-specific emotions = episodic and directed 

towards specific objects and events

- Moods are directed towards my thrownness into the 

world

HEIDEGGER: BEFINDLICHKEIT

Thrownness

- “facticity”
- “being delivered over to the there”
- “the burdensome character of  Dasein”
- We find ourselves inheriting circumstances that we have 

not chosen – i.e., with a certain make-up […] in a 
certain world […]. Our thrownness consists in the fact 
that we must exists with a large number of  ‘givens’ 
(393)

HEIDEGGER: BEFINDLICHKEIT

Disclosure

- Heidegger rejects correspondence as the deeper 

meaning of  truth in favor of  disclosedness

- “to lay open”
- A process of  discovering or finding something out by 

letting that thing come to light
≠ acquisition of  propositional knowledge!

DISCLOSURE VIA 

OBJECT-SPECIFIC EMOTIONS

1) Self-disclosure

2) Disclosure of  others

3) Instrumental/heuristic disclosure

4) Inexplicit or “gut” disclosure

5) “Phenomenological” disclosure

DISCLOSURE VIA MOODS

“Whatever the cause of  a particular mood may be […], to 
have a mood is to have a relation to what is inevitable in 
our lives. Our moods are about and directly confront the 
‘that’ and the ‘how’ of  our thrownness” (393)

- Disclosure of  trownness via moods doesn’t have to 
mean that we are fully cognizant of  our thrownness

- Nonpropositional, inexplicit and less-than-fully-

conscious way of  disclosing

DISCLOSURE VIA MOODS

Grundbefindlichkeit / Grundstimmung

 Example: Angst
• Anxiety brings us face to face with the ‘world as 

world’ and our own being as ‘being-in-the-world as 
such’

• We come to understand the defining features of  

human existence through anxiety

HEIDEGGER‘S  “BOLD“  CLAIM

 Some things are only knowable or experiencable by  

means of  emotions!

- Emotions reveal things that cannot otherwise be 

revealed: 

Difference between knowing that one will die and not giving 
a damn and knowing that one will die and giving a damn

“DISCLOSRE“ VS. “COGNITION“

- Cognition is derivative species of  disclosure
- Disclosure, as a broader phenomenon, entails:

- Knowing-that
- Knowing-how
- Emoting
- Creation of  art
- … etc. ?

- Weberman-“Definition”

 Claim: There is no non-affective disclosure –

understanding is always attuned!

WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED SO FAR?

INTERIM RECAP

That‘s just your 
emotions talking –
be rational and get 
a grip on yourself! 
Your feelings are 
irrelevant here.

It‘s interesting you 
feel that way, but let‘s 
turn to the facts now.

You are being impulsive 
– calm down and be 
objective.

Don‘t use such 
charged language, and 
leave your 
sentimentality out of  
this!

Facts are facts, 
regardless of  what 
you think or how 
you feel about 
them.

Come on! 
Don‘t get 
hysterical!

Don‘t let your 
feelings guide 
you! I just can‘t 
talk to you if  you 
won‘t calm down.

Well, now let‘s keep 
matters in perspective –
you‘re just arguing for 
your personal feelings. 
That‘s irrational.

Ok well, that‘s 
your subjective 
point of  view but 
we are talking 
about facts now.

This is a scientific 
question – values and 
subjective feelings are 
misplaced here! You have 
to stay neutral and 
objective in order to be a 
serious scientist!

INTRODUCTION SESSION

Costs I
(Recall)

$ 11 per part

*  12,5 million cars

=  $ 137 million

(to improve safety)

Costs II 
(Accidents)

180 deaths * $ 200 000
+ 180 injuries * $ 67 000
+ 2000 vehicles * $ 700

=  $ 49,5 million

FIRST TEXT: DYLAN EVANS

The Head and the Heart

EMOTION vs. RATIONALITY?

“RATIONALITY“

Rational

Emotional

“RATIONALITY“

“Rationality” can‘t be reduced to “instrumental reason”!
“Rationality” can‘t be reduced to “means-end-rationality”!
“Rationality” can‘t be reduced to … !

“Rationality” is a normative concept!

 Someone/something can just be rational 

according to a specific norm!

“RATIONALITY“

Behavior … etc.

Judgment
Emotion

… etc.

Desire

Belief

… etc.
Perception
Decision

… etc.

… can be rational or more rational or less 
rational or irrational…! Based on reasons! 
According to a norm! 

SECOND TEXT: CATHERINE ELGIN

The Heart has its Reasons

But …

FIRST INTERMEZZO

What do we / philosophers mean with “emotion”, 
“mood”, … ???

 We need some clarity! Definitions! The truth 

about all the concepts!

THE URGENT NEED FOR CLARITY

We all want to have clear categories and definitions in 
order to sort things, to feel comfortable, to have the 
feeling that everything has its place – to have certainty.

Bad news:
That‘s not possible – every order is the denial of  a 
multitude of  other possible orders …

THE URGENT NEED FOR CLARITY

“[…] a certain Chinese encyclopaedia entitled 'Celestial Empire of  
benevolent Knowledge'. In its remote pages it is written that the 
animals are divided into: 
(a) belonging to the emperor, (b) embalmed, (c) tame, (d) sucking 
pigs, (e) sirens, (f) fabulous, (g) stray dogs, (h) included in the 
present classification, (i) frenzied, (j) innumerable, (k) drawn with a 
very fine camelhair brush, (l) et cetera, (m) having just broken the 
water pitcher, (n) that from a long way off  look like flies.”

Jorge Luis Borges (1942): The analytic language of  John Wilkins.

NO DEFINITIONS …

… but maybe a sketch of  some ideas may help?

Like:
• Examples for differentiations between affective phenomena
• What could be different factors/components of  emotions?
• How do people classify emotions?
• Are emotions biological phenomena? Or social constructs?
• …

NO DEFINITIONS …

… but maybe a sketch of  some common theories?

The most classically differentiated perspectives:
• Somatic/feeling theories
• Cognitivist theories
• Perceptual theories
• “Situated” accounts
• …

SECOND TEXT: CATHERINE ELGIN

The Heart has its Reasons

ELGIN

1) Feelings
2) Frames of  mind
3) Tenability
4) Emotional honesty
5) Classification
6) Emotions and (the range of) epistemology

ELGIN

1) Feelings
2) Frames of  mind
3) Tenability
4) Emotional honesty
5) Classification
6) Emotions and (the range of) epistemology

Many questions concerned the issue of  what it can mean

for an emotion to be (unjustified). So we had a second
intermezzo!

SECOND INTERMEZZO

Notions of  appropriateness

in the affective realm

APPROPRIATENESS SESSION

1) Emotions: phenomenality, intentionality, evaluation

2) Emotions and perceptions
3) Correctness, justification and the fundamentum in re

4) What is missing? About the perspectival nature of  

emotions and the fundamentum in persona

ELGIN AGAIN

1) Feelings
2) Frames of  mind
3) Tenability
4) Emotional honesty
5) Classification
6) Emotions and (the range of) epistemology

We discussed some issues regarding 
emotions and art for a while. Are you still 
interested in having one of  the remaining 
sessions about this? And if  so – what 
exactly? 

ELGIN AGAIN

Focus so far: potential cognitive functions that 

emotions might play and justificatory questions (can we
trust our emotional insight? etc.)

Then, we changed our focus from how an emotion may
reveal insight to a specific ‘object’ / realm of  emotional 
insight, so to speak to one example of  the what of  
emotional insight  namely: morals!

THIRD TEXT: JESSE PRINZ

EMOTIONISM

- Metaphysical emotionism

EMOTIONISM

- Metaphysical emotionism

- Epistemic emotionism

Epistemic Emotionism
= Moral concepts are essentially related to 
emotions

“The disposition to feel the emotions 
mentioned in the metaphysical thesis is a 
possession condition on the normal 
concept ‘right’ (‘wrong’). (Prinz 2007, 21)

We left this (almost 
completely) out so far 
– is this a topic for 
one of  the remaining 
sessions?

FOURTH TEXT: HILARY PUTNAM

FACTS vs. VALUES?

THICK ETHICAL CONCEPTS

Example:

normative usage
(Father: “my child’s 
teacher is cruel”)

descriptive usage
(Historian: “monarch 
xy was cruel”)

normative 
component

cruel

descriptive 
component

IMPLICATIONS OF A BELIEF IN THE F/V 

DICHOTOMY

Putnam:

“[…] the question as to what the differences are 
between ‘factual’ judgments and ‘value’ judgments is 
no ivory-tower issue. Matters of  – literally – life and 

death may well be at stake.” (2002, 2)
