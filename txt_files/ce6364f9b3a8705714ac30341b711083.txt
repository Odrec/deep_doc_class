1. Introduction 
 
This excerpt deals with the grammar of adjectives with regard to secondary 
school students. All examples are taken from the British National Corpus (BNC) and 
are  categorized  as  classroom  interaction  and  academic  writings  respectively.  The 
purpose of Second Language Education shall not only focus on the mere study and 
transfer  of  rules  but  need  to  include  greater  amounts  of  genuine  listening  and 
speaking situations. To do so, students need to develop—and ultimately achieve—
certain competences that are defined in the “Niedersächsisches Kerncurriculum für 
das Gymnasium – gymnasiale Oberstufe im Fach Englisch”. One of the main areas 
of  competence  consists  of  functional-communicative  skills:  “Im  Englischunterricht 
ist  die  sprachliche  und  interkulturelle  Handlungsfähigkeit  das  übergeordnete  Ziel. 
Erfolgreiches sprachliches Handeln umfasst die Fähigkeit zu Rezeption, Produktion 
und Interaktion.” The highest communicative competence lies within the ability to 
successfully deal with native speakers and hence develop communication skills that 
range from B2 to C1 according to the “Common European Framework of Reference 
for Languages: Learning, Teaching, Assessment” (CEFR). 
 
Therefore,  the  following  explanations  intend  to  not  only  show  written 
communication  but  at  the  same  time  showcase  spoken  interaction.  Henceforth,  the 
aim of this grammar is to illustrate a variety of adjectives that are commonly used by 
native speakers to allow students to develop native-like skills. We, the authors, intend 
to  hand  the  learner  a  toolbox  of  adjectives  that  they  can  use  in  educational  and 
academic contexts.  
In the following this grammar will show how to use an adjective, where to 
 
put it in the sentence structure and finally about the different types of meaning that 
may derive from one specific German term like “schön”.
