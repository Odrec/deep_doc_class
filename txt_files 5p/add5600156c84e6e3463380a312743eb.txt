Science, Ethics and War: A Pacifists Perspective (Jeffrey Kovac) 
Question: According to the text the concept of “just war“ comprises the concepts jus in bello, 
jus ad bellum and jus post bellum. Jus ad bellum says war is justified if there is a “just” cause 
and a high probability of success. Disregarding that the latter is very unlikely to be predicted 
correctly-  how  would  advocates  of just war deal with a situation where cause and expected 
outcome  are  in  conflict  with  each  other  (say  there  is  a  cause  which  is  considered  just  but 
success is rather unlikely)? Regarding the conjunctive nature of the concept if one conjunct is 
false surely the whole formula should be rendered false?
