The Na+ gradient produced across the cardiac sarcolemma by the ATP-dependent Na+-pump is a constant
source of energy for Na+-dependent transporters. The plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) is one
such secondary active transporter, regulating intracellular pH, Na+ concentration, and cell volume. NHE1,
the major isoform found in the heart, is activated in response to a variety of stimuli such as hormones and
mechanical stress. This important characteristic of NHE1 is intimately linked to heart diseases, including mal-
adaptive cardiac hypertrophy and subsequent heart failure, as well as acute ischemic-reperfusion injury.
NHE1 activation results in elevation of pH and intracellular Na+ concentration, which potentially enhance
downstream signaling cascades in the myocardium. Therefore, in addition to determining the mechanism un-
derlying regulation of NHE1 activity, it is important to understand how the ionic signal produced by NHE1 is
transmitted to the downstream targets. Extensive studies have identiﬁed many accessory factors that interact
with NHE1. Here, we have summarized the recent progress on understanding the molecular mechanism un-
derlying NHE1 regulation and have shown a possible signaling pathway leading to cardiac remodeling, which
is initiated from NHE1. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled “Na+ Regulation in Cardiac Myocytes”.

provided by Na+–K+-ATPase. The housekeeping isoform NHE1 is a
key regulator of intracellular pH (pHi), Na+ concentration, and cell vol-
ume in virtually all tissues [1]. In cardiac muscles, intracellular acidosis
results in Na+-overload via NHE1, followed by a sustained increase in
the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration via cardiac Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. In
addition, acidosis itself seriously reduces myoﬁbrilar Ca2+ sensitivity,
resulting in contractile dysfunction. Therefore, it is important for cardiac
muscles to rapidly remove acid load during contraction, particularly
under pathological conditions such as ischemia.

NHE1 has also been implicated in cardiac hypertrophy and chronic
heart disease. In various diseased animal models, the NHE1 inhibitor
had a highly beneﬁcial effect [2]. The involvement of NHE1 in chronic
disease is strongly linked to the ﬁnding that NHE1 is activated in

response to hormones such as endothelin-1 and norepinephrine, as
well as mechanical stress like stretching; these factors are all inducers
of cardiac remodeling. In studies on NHE1, 2 fundamental questions
arise: 1) How is NHE1 regulated? and 2) What does NHE1 regulate?
Many upstream and downstream targets of NHE1 have been identiﬁed.
In this review, we will brieﬂy summarize the basic knowledge on the
NHE1 molecule and then report the recent progress on several accesso-
ry factors of NHE1, which play critical roles in the regulation of NHE1 ac-
tivity. Finally, we will discuss the ampliﬁcation of downstream signaling
pathways by NHE1 activation, leading to cardiac remodeling. The
structure–function relationship and pathological aspects of this trans-
port system have been extensively reviewed earlier [2–9]. Interested
readers should also refer to these reviews.

2. Na+/H+ exchanger molecule

In 1989, Sardet et al. ﬁrst cloned the human Na+/H+ exchanger
cDNA by genetic complementation of exchanger-deﬁcient cells [10].
This protein is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues and is now known
as NHE1. Since the initial identiﬁcation of NHE1, 9 isoforms have been
discovered, referred to as NHE1–NHE9. NHE1–NHE5 are expressed in
the plasma membrane, while NHE6–NHE9 localize to the intracellular
membranes such as the Golgi apparatus and endosomes [11]. In contrast
to the ubiquitous expression of NHE1, NHE2–NHE5 show a restricted ex-
pression pattern: for example, NHE2–NHE4 is predominantly expressed
in the epithelial cells of the kidney, small intestine and stomach, and
NHE5 is mainly expressed in the brain. In addition to NHE1–NHE9, at
least 3 different exchangers or exchanger-like proteins (NHA1–2 and
sperm-NHE) are known [12,13]. Interestingly, human NHA2, which
shares homology with the bacterial Na+/H+ antiporter NhaA, is an
amiloride-insensitive and phloretin-inhibitable cation-H+ exchanger
that may be involved in essential hypertension [14,15]. Sperm-NHE is
critical for male fertility and sperm motility [16]. It contains a potential
voltage sensor and a consensus cyclic nucleotide-binding motif [16] and
has been shown to be important for bicarbonate regulation of adenylate
cyclase [17].

NHE1 is the major isoform found in cardiac muscle. NHE1 can be sep-
arated into the amino (N)-terminal transmembrane domain (~500 resi-
dues) catalyzing ion transport and the carboxy (C)-terminal hydrophilic
cytoplasmic domain (~300 residues) mediating the regulation of ex-
change activity. Derivatives of the NHE1 inhibitor amiloride are known
to interact with the N-terminal domain of NHE1 [18–20]. Initial cysteine
accessibility analysis allowed us to construct a topology model of NHE1
consisting of 12 transmembrane spanning segments with some
membrane-protruding regions (Fig. 1A) [21]. The 3-dimensional structur-
al model [22,23], based on the structure of NhaA [24], predicts the cation-
and inhibitor-binding sites provided by several transmembrane helices
(TMs 4 and 9). The predicted topology model [23] is slightly different
from the previously described model of NHE1 [21]. At least in part of
the NHE1 overexpressed in ﬁbroblasts, the N-terminal tail just prior to
the ﬁrst hydrophobic segment (or the ﬁrst putative transmembrane do-
main, TM1) was detected as a part of the mature molecule [21],
suggesting that the N-terminus is not cleaved. However, in vitro topology
analysis later showed the presence of a signal sequence, suggesting the
possible cleavage of the N-terminus [25]. Recent amino acid sequencing
analysis of NHE1 puriﬁed from ﬁbroblasts or SF9 insect cells revealed
that cleavage indeed occurs between Gly-36 and Leu-37 just behind
TM1 (cleavage site in Fig. 1A) (Wakabayashi, S., unpublished observa-
tion). Therefore, the initial experiment [21] might instead detect a
minor fraction of NHE1 in which the N-tail remained under forced
expression.

NHE1 exists as a homodimer in the plasma membrane [26–28],
with a compact globular domain assigned to the transmembrane do-
main [29]. Although dimerization essentially occurs between the
N-terminal transmembrane domains of 2 subunits [28], there is evi-
dence that the cytoplasmic domains also contribute to dimer formation

[27]. While dimerization with a catalytically inactive NHE1 mutant
markedly reduced the exchange activity of the wild-type NHE1 through
an acidic shift of the pHi dependence [30], such dominant negative effect
was not observed when the cytoplasmic H+ concentration was sufﬁ-
ciently high [28,30]. These observations support the view that dimeriza-
tion of 2 active subunits is required for NHE1 to possess exchange
activity in the neutral pHi range, although each subunit is capable of cat-
alyzing transport in the acidic pHi range. This notion is supported by the
kinetic data obtained using oscillating pH electrodes combined with
whole cell patch clamp and can be explained by the “coupled dimer
model,” in which 2 Na+ and 2 H+ ions are transported per cycle [31].

NHE1 catalyzes an electroneutral exchange of Na+ and H+ across the
membrane. In contrast to external pH dependence, the concentration
dependence of cytosolic H+ on Na+/H+ exchange is much steeper,
with a Hill coefﬁcient of >2. Such pHi dependence suggests the existence
of more than 1 H+ binding site. Activation of the exchange activity by cy-
tosolic H+ is explained by the presence of additional H+-binding site(s)
(H+-modiﬁer site or H+-sensor) [32,33]. However, a recent study
reported that H+ activation of NHE1 is best explained by an allosteric
model for a dimer transporter without considering an additional H+ sen-
sor site [34]. Such a model is well ﬁtted to the activation of NHE1 in re-
sponse to mitogens and osmotic stress [34,35]. Although a deﬁnitive
conclusion for the mechanism underlying H+ activation awaits detailed
mapping of H+-binding sites on the NHE1 molecule, several critical
amino acid residues such as Glu-131, Arg-327, and Arg-440 have been
identiﬁed as important determinants of the pHi dependence of NHE1
[34,36,37]. It is generally accepted that acute activation of NHE1 occurs
via an increase in the afﬁnity of cytoplasmic H+ for NHE1, rather than
an increase in the maximal exchange activity (Vmax).

3. Regulation of NHE1

NHE1 is activated in response to various extracellular stimuli. This is
thought to occur via the interaction of accessory proteins or bioactive sub-
stances with the cytoplasmic domain by a phosphorylation-dependent or
phosphorylation-independent mechanism. The cytoplasmic domain of
NHE1 has been reported to interact with various proteins, including
Ca2+-binding proteins, protein kinases, phosphatases, and cytoskeletal
proteins [38–48]. In addition, NHE1 is known to be phosphorylated at
Ser-703 by p90 ribosomal S6 kinase [49] and at Ser-648 by protein kinase
B/Akt [50,51]. Furthermore, the distal cytoplasmic region of NHE1 is phos-
phorylated at multiple sites [52–54]. Identiﬁcation of many accessory fac-
tors and multiple phosphorylation sites has suggested that regulation of
NHE1 occurs through a complex process. However, the precise binding
sites of accessory factors on NHE1 have been determined in only a few ex-
amples. In addition, a previous serial deletion mutant study [55] showed
that the pHi sensitivity of NHE1 was largely affected only by the deletion
of 2 cytoplasmic subdomains, the juxtamembrane cytoplasmic domain
with ~100 residues (amino acid [aa] 500–600) and the autoinhibitory
middle region (aa 636–659). Therefore, accessory factors linked to these
2 subdomains may have a larger impact on the acute regulation of ex-
change activity. Here, we have summarized research progress on the 3 ac-
cessory factors that have been studied most extensively: Calcineurin B
homologous protein (CHP), calmodulin (CaM), and phospholipids
interacting with these subdomains.

3.1. Calcineurin B homologous protein

Of the accessory proteins that interact with the exchangers, the
greatest attention has been focused on calcineurin B homologous
proteins (CHPs) [56]. CHPs were identiﬁed at nearly the same time
by 4 separate groups by using different strategies: phage library
screening [39]; yeast 2-hybrid screening [57] (personal communica-
tion from Dr. Hiroshi. Kanazawa, 1996); immunoprecipitation with
NHE1 [58], as an NHE1-interacting protein; and biochemical meth-
odology, as a protein (p22) involved in vesicular transport [59].
