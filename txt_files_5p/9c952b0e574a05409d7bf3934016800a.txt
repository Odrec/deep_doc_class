Neural Correlates of the Self: 

The right ventromedial prefrontal Cortex 

VMPFC  in general: 
• Value representation/ implicit  affect 
  Lane 2008 
• Gut decisions  
  Bechara & Damasio 2009 
• Emotion regulation  
  Davidson 2002 

Right VMPFC: 
• own face processing                                      

e.g. Keenan et al. 2001 

• self-referential traits                  

e.g. Craik et al. 1999
