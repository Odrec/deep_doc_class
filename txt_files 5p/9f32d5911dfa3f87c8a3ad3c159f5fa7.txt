First, I must to say, very good text.  

I have one question, or I have one problem with this text.  

Sandberg wrote: „  However, even in human societies that allow polygamy it is usually relatively rare 

(less than 20%) and tied to high economic status [51, 79]. Thus, even when almost 80% of surveyed 

societies allow polygamy, monogamy is practiced by 80% of their inhabitants. The largest populations 

mostly belong to officially monogamous societies [80]. It is possible that polygamy is a function of the 

resources of male and the freedom of the females to select the best partners, even if having to share 

that partner with others.“ 

 

I agree with Sandberg with economic status. But for example, when all people from country, which 

use  polygamy  have  lot  of  many  and  good  economic  status,  this  people  would  like  to  polygamy 

(especially man).  

Matt Ridley in publication Red Queen talk about strategy for life. In people – ladies like quality and 

males like quantity. Why? Because it is better strategy for life genes. I think, married is only our rules 

from religion – nothing else.
