Question for “Responsible Dual Use”, John Forge
Julian Putzer

The author argues that scientist need justification for their research as a part of their forward-looking 
responsibility. This justification need to be the good or neutral intention of a dual use research, the 
example given in the text concerns weaponry and a justification in the likes of the need for defensive 
capabilities.
In my opinion every scientist is obliged to produce as much knowledge as possible, the outcomes are to
handle by society. My question therefore is, isn’t every research justified by producing knowledge and 
isnt it society's obligation to control the usage of what comes from that knowledge?
