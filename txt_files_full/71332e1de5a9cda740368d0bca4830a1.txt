Introduction to  
English Language Teaching 

Session 5:  

Approaches and methods 

1 

Past and present issues in ELT: 

 Make use of L1 or avoid it? 

 Focus on form(s) or focus on meaning? 

 Study rules or have language learning 

“take care of itself”? 

 

 What do you think?

‘Approach’ and ‘method’  

 

“Language teaching is sometimes discussed in 
terms of three related aspects: APPROACH, 
METHOD, and TECHNIQUES. 

Different theories about the nature of language 
and how languages are learned (the approach) 
imply different ways of teaching language (the 
method), and different methods make use of 
different kinds of classroom activity (the 
technique).” 
 
(Richards/Platt/Weber 1985: 15 f.)

Describing methods and techniques 

1. comparative, use of L1 
= crosslingual 

 

2. Language centred, 
analytical, formal = 
objective 

 

Non-comparative, 
avoidance of L1 = 
intralingual 

Message-centred, 
experiental = 

subjective 

 

3. Cognitive „learning“ = 
explicit 

Non-cognitive  
„acquisition“ = implicit 

(Stern 1983, quoted in Doff/Klippel 2007, 265f.)

Communicative Language 
Teaching (CLT) 

 What is CLT? 

 

 Look at the „communicative continuum“ 

(Harmer 2004, 70). How can this 
continuum be useful in practice? 

 Harmer mentions some points of 

criticism of CLT (70-71). Do you think 
they are valid?

Task-based learning (Willis 1994) 

Pre-task phase 

Priming and preparation activities, introducing topic and 

task 
 

Task  

Task, planning a report and reporting back 

 

Form Focus 

Analysis and practice 

Common procedure: Presentation, 
Practice, Production (PPP) 

 criticism 

“The problem is that PPP serves the teacher’s needs but it is 
debatable whether or not it fulfills the needs of the learner.” 
(Trowbridge) 

 variations and alternatives 

 integration

Task-based learning (TBL) 

 

 Read the passage on TBLL and PPP in 

M.H./S.v.D. (42). How does their perspective 
differ from those that were introduced in 
Harmer? Do you think their points are 
justified?

The Lexical Approach 

“Language consists not of traditional 
grammar and vocabulary but often of 
multi-word prefabricated chunks.” (Lewis 
1997:3)

Why deal with approaches and 
methods? 

 a view of how the field of language teaching 

has evolved 

 source of well-used practices, which teachers 

can adapt or implement based on their own 
needs 

 foil for reflection 

 help teachers becoming clearer on where 

they stand 

12 

Conclusions 

 Methods are informed by approaches and 

implemented following certain procedures and/or 
using certain techniques. 

 Knowledge of approaches, methods, procedures and 

techniques is useful for various reasons. 

 A number of modern approaches/methods are quite 

influential, but they have also been criticised.  

 Teachers rarely prescribe to a clearly outlined 
method: “The actual way [teachers] do things 
depends not on the choice of a method […] but rather 
on why and where [they] are teaching” (Harmer, 79).
