Eukaryotic replication disrupts each nucleosome as the fork passes, followed by reassembly of disrupted nu-
cleosomes and incorporation of newly synthesized histones into nucleosomes in the daughter genomes. In this
review, we examine this process of replication-coupled nucleosome assembly to understand how characteristic
steady-state nucleosome landscapes are attained. Recent studies have begun to elucidate mechanisms involved in
histone transfer during replication and maturation of the nucleosome landscape after disruption by replication. A
fuller understanding of replication-coupled nucleosome assembly will be needed to explain how epigenetic
information is replicated at every cell division.

INTRODUCTION

Animals and plants develop from a single-celled zygote to a multicel-
lular organism with scores of different cell types that perform a multitude
of unique functions and yet carry the same genome. This diversity in
cellular identity during development and adulthood is achieved by dif-
ferential gene activation and repression in distinct cell types. Gene ex-
pression is influenced by nucleosomes, which mediate accessibility and
hence all biochemical activities on the genome. The overall inhibitory
role of nucleosomes on genomic access is modulated by posttransla-
tional modifications of histones in the nucleosome and the replace-
ment of canonical histones in the nucleosome by histone variants.
Thus, the pattern of differential gene expression that contributes to
cellular identity is reflected in features that differentiate nucleosomes
along the genome, the “nucleosome landscape.” The major histone
modifications classically associated with repressed chromatin domains
include H3K9 trimethylation (H3K9me3), which is found in consti-
tutive heterochromatin, and H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), which
is found in facultative heterochromatin. The major histone variants
include H3.3, H2A.Z, and the centromeric H3 variant, cenH3. In meta-
zoans, H3.3 and H2A.Z are broadly distributed throughout the ge-
nome, but are differentially enriched at particular regions including
actively transcribed regions, whereas cenH3 is rarely found outside
of centromeres.

The nucleosome landscape of different cell types is established in
large part through processes that disrupt and replace nucleosomes,
mainly transcription, chromatin remodeling, and replication. Exam-
ples of transcription and remodeling establishing the cell type–specific
nucleosome landscape include widespread transcription at enhancers
(1), remodeling (2), and nucleosome turnover (3) at Polycomb response
elements (PREs) in Drosophila, which are sites required for maintain-
ing cell type–specific transcriptional programs through several cell divi-
sions during development.

For eukaryotic development to proceed, the nucleosome landscape
must be reproduced by default in daughter cells after DNA replication,
which proceeds bidirectionally from origins bound by the origin recog-
nition complex. The replication fork consists minimally of the mini-
chromosome maintenance (MCM) helicase and DNA polymerase,
both of which are loaded at replication origins at the beginning of re-
plication, and the replicative processivity clamp, PCNA. The MCM
complex forms a channel around a single strand of DNA (the leading

strand of replication) and unwinds DNA in front of it (4). An MCM
channel translocating on single-stranded DNA will result in the com-
plete disruption of the nucleosome. Thus, over a few seconds of passage
of the helicase and the replication machinery behind, there is massive
disruption that dissociates the prereplication nucleosome landscape.

After the new strand of DNA is synthesized by the polymerase, as-
sembly factors reconstitute old nucleosomes and assemble new nucleo-
somes behind the replication fork. Because there is a doubling of genetic
material during replication, cells require double the amount of the ge-
nome packing material, namely, the histones. To provide sufficient
material at S phase, there is massive synthesis of the four canonical
histones, which form the nucleosome core that wraps 147 base pairs
(bp) of DNA, and the linker histone H1, which cements an additional
~20-bp DNA wrap to the nucleosome surface. Newly replicated chro-
matin must incorporate both the preexisting histones disrupted by the
replication fork and the newly synthesized histones. The main ques-
tions for elucidating the inheritance of nucleosome features during rep-
lication are as follows: How are old and new histones incorporated
during replication-coupled nucleosome assembly? How is the nucleo-
some landscape altered during replication?

Stable inheritance of epigenetic information through replication is
exemplified by cytosine methylation at CG dinucleotides in most
animals and plants. At CG dinucleotides, methylation is symmetric,
that is, the cytosine on both strands is methylated. At replication, each
daughter CG dinucleotide inherits one of the two symmetrically methy-
lated cytosines from the parental strand, base-paired to an unmethylated
cytosine on the newly synthesized strand, that is, a hemimethylated CG
dinucleotide. The Dnmt1 methyltransferase recognizes the hemi-
methylated CG dinucleotide and methylates the cytosine on the newly
synthesized strand. Thus, the methylation status of parental CG dinu-
cleotides is inherited by the daughter chromosomes through the hemi-
methylated state. In this review, we describe examples where
nucleosomes are “replicated” on the daughter chromosomes analogous
to cytosine methylation at CG dinucleotides, with the goal of delineat-
ing the underlying mechanisms.

NUCLEOSOME INHERITANCE THROUGH REPLICATION

To understand how nucleosomes are inherited through replication, we
need to first consider the constraints posed by the structure of the nu-
cleosome. The nucleosome core consists of the centrally located H3-H4
tetramer flanked on either side by an H2A-H2B dimer. Nucleosomal
DNA enters at the “proximal” H2A-H2B dimer and exits at the “distal”

H2A-H2B dimer. The twofold mirror symmetry of the nucleosome
means that half the length of nucleosomal DNA (73 bp) wraps one-half
of the histone octamer consisting of one each of the H2A-H2B and
H3-H4 dimers. DNA-histone contacts at the entry and exit sites of the
nucleosome are the most labile, and these contacts can be lost during
normal thermal fluctuations, resulting in transient unwrapping of nu-
cleosomes (5). This results in H2A-H2B dimers being more susceptible
to loss and replacement than H3-H4. In contrast, the central location of
the H3-H4 tetramer is expected to restrain its turnover, which in exper-
imental measurements is markedly lower than that of H2A-H2B (6).
Tracking nucleosome inheritance then becomes primarily a problem
of tracking the H3-H4 tetramer through replication.

The nucleosome landscape as defined by the identity of H3 and H4
would be marked by H3 variants H3.1/H3.2 or H3.3 and posttransla-
tional modifications on H3 and H4. Posttranslational modifications
associated with active chromatin are predominantly found on H3.3
compared to H3.1/H3.2, whereas modifications that are part of the
machinery involved in repression (H3K27me and H3K9me) are pre-
dominantly found on H3.1/H3.2 (7). Inheritance of a silenced region
through replication would in some scenarios involve inheritance of
H3-bearing modifications associated with repression at the same ge-
nomic location. Alternatively, the silenced region could be set up afresh
each time after replication. Of the several modes of nucleosome assembly,
replication-coupled assembly is distinguished by the fact that the canon-
ical H3 (H3.1 and H3.2, hereinafter referred to as H3) is incorporated
into chromatin only through this pathway (8). Replication-independent
pathways of nucleosome assembly strictly incorporate only H3.3 (8).

Given alternative pathways and mechanisms to maintain the nu-
cleosome landscape, we need to determine what is the relative signif-
icance of replication-coupled assembly in maintaining the nucleosome
landscape through inheritance. Whereas histones are essential, disrup-
tion of replication-coupled assembly is not lethal in the budding yeast,
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, indicating that nucleosome assembly path-
ways are largely redundant in this organism. However, disruption of
replication-coupled assembly results in derepression of silent loci (9–12).
A requirement for replication-coupled assembly to maintain silencing
is also seen in the worm, Caenorhabditis elegans, where deletion of 11
residues in the H3 C terminus in 1 of 24 H3 genes results in the loss of
asymmetry in the identities of a neuron pair (13). Deletion of these re-
sidues in H3 is predicted to destabilize the nucleosome due to loss of
contacts that stabilize the H3-H4 tetramer interface. The H3 C-terminal
deletion is phenocopied by disruption of replication-coupled assembly,
which suggests that impaired replication-coupled assembly can affect
developmental decisions. Here, similar to the situation in budding yeast,
inefficient assembly or assembly of destabilized nucleosomes (with mu-
tant H3) results in replication-independent assembly pathways filling
in the “holes” in the nucleosome landscape with H3.3 after replication.
The replication-coupled assembly pathway is also essential for devel-
opment in plants (Arabidopsis thaliana) (14, 15) and in flies (Drosophila
melanogaster) (16, 17), even in the presence of alternate nucleosome assem-
bly pathways. In cultured human cells, disruption of replication-coupled
assembly results in increased replication-independent incorporation of
H3.3 (18). Because old H3.3 is enriched in histone modifications that
are primarily associated with active chromatin, it is possible that
spurious incorporation of H3.3 could disrupt silencing at inactive
regions.

The importance of replication-coupled nucleosome assembly in
maintaining silent chromatin states in yeast and for proper devel-

opment in worms, flies, and plants suggests a role for this pathway in
epigenetic inheritance. Direct evidence for the essentiality of the main-
tenance of histone variants through replication is exemplified by cenH3,
the histone variant that replaces H3 at centromeres. Loss of cenH3 main-
tenance through replication can result in loss of centromere identity (19).

TRACKING CHROMATIN INHERITANCE
THROUGH REPLICATION

Nucleosome inheritance would involve not only the transfer of old
histone variants and posttranslational modifications to the newly syn-
thesized chromosomes but also preservation of the genomic location
of the old histones. In principle, we can track nucleosome inheritance
at multiple levels: in bulk, at the level of genomes or chromosomes, at
the level of large chromatin domains (~10 kb), and at the single nu-
cleosome level. Currently, we have solid evidence for chromatin inher-
itance only at the bulk level.

Several methods have been developed recently to temporally track
proteins associated with replication forks by isolating newly replicated
chromatin labeled with nucleotide analogs (20–22). Combining the
isolation of newly replicated chromatin with differential labeling of
old and new histones with stable isotopes has enabled the quantifica-
tion of the extent of transfer of old, modified histones and histone
variants at the replication fork (23). This method also has high tem-
poral resolution, enabling pulse-chase experiments to track the matu-
ration of newly assembled chromatin over time. In cultured human
cells, this method showed that only a small fraction of old H2A.Z is
retained in the newly replicated chromatin and that H2A.Z is incor-
porated much later than fork progression, indicating little or no inher-
itance of H2A.Z during replication. H3.3 levels in newly replicated
chromatin are the same as in bulk chromatin, indicating fast incorpo-
ration of both old and new H3.3 into the newly replicated chromatin.
Thus, with respect to histone variants, H3.3 levels drop twofold immedi-
ately after replication, indicative of random segregation to both daughter
chromosomes, whereas H2A.Z levels drop much more, indicating loss of
H2A.Z in the daughter chromosomes. With respect to histone mod-
ifications, the newly replicated chromatin has half the levels of
H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 compared to total H3. This could be
attributed to equal distribution of old H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 be-
tween the daughter chromosomes, as evidenced by the lack of these
methylation marks in newly synthesized H3.

H3K27me3 is deposited by the Polycomb repressive complex 2
(PRC2) (24, 25). H3K27me3 is part of the machinery that maintains
transcriptional repression of large chromatin domains over successive
cell divisions (26). In the embryonic germ line of worm hermaphro-
dites, H3K27me3 is maintained by PRC2 on maternal chromosomes
but remains absent from previously unmodified paternal chromosomes
(27). Conversely, in a PRC2 null embryo, H3K27me3 containing pater-
nal chromosomes retain the modified nucleosomes during twofold
dilution at each cell division. This provides direct evidence of post-
translationally modified histone inheritance through successive cell
divisions (27).

Spatially restricted inheritance of old histones has also been ob-
served in germline stem cells in fly testes (28). These stem cells are at-
tached to a cellular structure called the hub, and the daughter cells that
go on to differentiate can be clearly distinguished from the stem cells
spatially. When the fates of old and newly synthesized histones were
