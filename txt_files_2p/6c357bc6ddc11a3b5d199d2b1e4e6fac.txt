ABSTRACT 

This  study  proposes  that  the  existing  policy-making  categories  of  forced  migration  fail  to 

encompass  the  unique  displacement  experiences  of  individuals,  and  thus  fail  to  fulfill  their 

particular needs. In the first part of the study, in order to construct a theoretical framework, I 

juxtapose what I see as two different groups of forced migration literature. In the second part, 

using the data collected during my fieldwork in Turkey, I illustrate the importance that factors 

other than push factors have in forced migration, thus suggesting that forced migrants are not 

only passive victims, but active people who consciously use their social networks and various 

types of capitals in order to influence their migration.  In the final part,  I argue  for  a critical 

approach to  forced migration research, that  would be open for  authentic  voices of migrants, 

and that would create more flexible, analytic categories of forced migration.
