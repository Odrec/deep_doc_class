Exercise 1 (8/20)

Transform the following sentences into optimal DNF. Show how you performed the transformation
e.g. by noticing something significant about the sentence being transformed, constructing a truth 
table for it, and/or specifying the logical principles being invoked during optimization. 

1.1.

A → (B ↔ C)

1.2. 

 X → Y ↔ ¬Y → ¬X

1.4.

¬Q

Exercise 2 (8/20)

Transform the following sentences into optimal CNF. Show how you performed the transformation 
e.g. by noticing something significant about the sentence being transformed, constructing a truth 
table for it, and/or specifying the logical principles being invoked during optimization.

Exercise 3 (4/20)

Which of the following statements is true? Briefly explain your answer.

3.1.

3.2.

3.3.

3.4.

A CNF is a disjunction of conjunctions.

The set {

∧¬,→,

} is a complete system.

Every wff in disjunctive normal form contains the disjunction symbol.

A, B, C  Ψ. Therefore, A, B, and C semantically entail Ψ.
