The yiaQRS genes of Escherichia coli K-12 are involved
in carbohydrate metabolism. Clustering of homologous
genes was found throughout several unrelated bacteria.
Strikingly, all four bacterial transport protein classes
were found, conserving transport function but not mech-
anism. It appears that during evolution the ability to
transport, phosphorylate and metabolize substrates of
unknown identity have been conserved. However, the
transporter classes have been swapped. This probably
demonstrates the subtlety of transport-protein evolution.

The gene cluster designated yiaJKLMNOPQRS (GenBank
accession number g1789999 – 1790008) in the Escherichia
coli K-12 genome (Figure 1a) has been suggested to be
involved in the uptake and metabolism of carbohydrates
[1–5]. Recently, we have demonstrated that the bind-
ing protein-dependent secondary transporter (Figure 2a)
encoded by the yiaMNO genes transports the rare pentose
L-xylulose, providing the ﬁrst evidence that these systems
are able to transport carbohydrates [6]. During character-
ization of this transporter we became interested in the
function of the remaining genes in the cluster. An increase
in the availability of genome databases has permitted a
search for similar gene clusters among other organisms.
Homologs of the individual yiaQ, yiaR and yiaS genes
were discovered in several bacterial and archaeal genomes
(T.H. Plantinga et al., unpublished). Remarkably, cluster-
ing of these genes in putative operons occurs in a limited

Figure 1. The structural organization of highly similar gene clusters that contain
yiaQRS homologs (blue). These cluster with members from any of the four classes
of bacterial transport proteins (purple). This is demonstrated in four model organ-
isms. Conventional nomenclature is used, with proposed alternatives provided
below each gene. Shades of blue identify genes that encode homologous
enzymes: yiaQ and yjfV, 3-keto-L-gulonate 6-phosphate decarboxylases; yiaR and
yjfW, (putative) L-xylulose 5-phosphate 3-epimerases; yiaS and yjfX, ribulose-5-
phosphate 4-epimerases. The (putative) kinases are shown in yellow. (a) The
yiaJ– S gene cluster of Escherichia coli K-12 contains a binding protein-dependent
secondary transporter {yiaM, small [4 transmembrane domains (TMDs)] mem-
brane protein; yiaN,
large [12 TMDs] membrane protein; yiaO, periplasmic
substrate-binding protein}. (b) The yiaJ– S gene cluster of Klebsiella oxytoca con-
tains a secondary transporter (yiaX2) and a chemotaxis-like protein (yiaX1). (c) The
yjfQ–X gene cluster of E. coli K-12 contains a phosphotransferase system (PTS)
(yjfS, permease IIC component; yjfT and yjfU, cytosolic phosphotransferase com-
ponents IIB and IIA, respectively). (d) The YPO3328-3332 genes of Yersinia pestis
encode a binding protein-dependent primary ATP-binding cassette (ABC) trans-
porter [YPO3328, periplasmic substrate-binding protein; YPO3330, ABC (ATPase)
domain; YPO3331 and YPO3332, permease domains]. The gene order is not con-
served, but yiaR, yiaS and yiaP homologs are present. Red (yiaJ and yjfQ), putative
regulators; tnp, transposase. [1– 4,7,9,17].
