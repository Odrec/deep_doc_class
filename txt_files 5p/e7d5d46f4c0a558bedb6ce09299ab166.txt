QUESTIONS ON EAGLETON, “WHAT IS LITERATURE”

'essence' of literature whatsoever”? Do you agree? Why? 
• Why does Eagleton state that literature is a “functional” 

rather than an “ontological” term?

• What is a ‘literary canon’? How does Eagleton critique it? 
• Do you agree with the statement, “All literary works…are 
'rewritten', if only unconsciously, by the societies which read 
them”? Why?

• Discuss the statement, “The claim that knowledge should be 

'value-free' is itself a value-judgement”.

• How does Eagleton explain the term ‘ideology’?
