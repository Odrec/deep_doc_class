SUMMARY

TCP proteins belong to the plant-speciﬁc bHLH transcription factor family, and function as key regulators of
diverse developmental processes. Functional redundancy amongst family members and post-transcriptional
down-regulation by miRJAW of several TCP genes complicate their functional characterization. Here, we
explore the role of TCP3 by analyzing transgenic plants expressing miRJAW-resistant mTCP3 and dominant-
negative TCP3SRDX. Seedlings and seeds of mTCP3 plants were found to hyper-accumulate ﬂavonols, an-
thocyanins and proanthocyanidins, whereas levels of proanthocyanidins were slightly reduced in TCP3SRDX
plants. R2R3-MYB proteins control not only early ﬂavonoid biosynthetic steps but also activate late ﬂavo-
noid biosynthetic genes by forming ternary R2R3-MYB/bHLH/WD40 (MBW) complexes. TCP3 interacted in
yeast with R2R3-MYB proteins, which was further conﬁrmed in planta using BiFC experiments. Yeast three-
hybrid assays revealed that TCP3 signiﬁcantly strengthened the transcriptional activation capacity of R2R3-
MYBs bound by the bHLH protein TT8. Transcriptome analysis of mTCP3 and TCP3SRDX plants supported a
role for TCP3 in enhancing ﬂavonoid biosynthesis. Moreover, several auxin-related developmental abnor-
malities were observed in mTCP3 plants. Transcriptome data coupled with studies of an auxin response
reporter and auxin efﬂux carriers showed that TCP3 negatively modulates the auxin response, probably by
compromising auxin transport capacity. Genetic experiments revealed that the chalcone synthase mutant
tt4-11 lacking ﬂavonoid biosynthesis abrogated the auxin-related defects caused by mTCP3. Together, these
data suggest that TCP3 interactions with R2R3-MYBs lead to enhanced ﬂavonoid production, which further
negatively modulates the auxin response.

INTRODUCTION

The plant-speciﬁc TCP family of transcription factors is
named after the ﬁrst three identiﬁed members: TEOSINTE
BRANCHED1 in maize (Zea mays), CYCLOIDEA (CYC) in
Antirrhinum majus, and PROLIFERATING CELL NUCLEAR
ANTIGEN FACTOR in rice (Oryza sativa). Repeated gene
duplications during land plant evolution have enlarged this
family of bHLH-containing DNA-binding proteins (Martın-
Trillo and Cubas, 2010). The Arabidopsis thaliana genome
encodes 24 TCP transcription factors. Based on the struc-
ture of their conserved TCP domains, 13 TCP proteins have
been identiﬁed as members of class I (TCP-P) and have
been suggested to function as positive regulators of cell
proliferation (Kosugi and Ohashi, 2002). The other 11 TCP
proteins belong to class II (TCP-C). CYC controls ﬂoral sym-
metry formation in Antirrhinum (Luo et al., 1996), and its
Arabidopsis ortholog TCP1 participates in brassinosteroid

biosynthesis and modulates longitudinal elongation of
leaves and stems (Guo et al., 2010; Koyama et al., 2010b).
The products of
II/TCP-C genes, TCP12
(BRANCHED2) and TCP18 (BRANCHED1), operate as inte-
grators of branching signals within axillary buds (Aguilar-
Martinez et al., 2007), and TCP12 has also been shown to
repress the ﬂoral transition of axillary meristems (Niwa
et al., 2013). Generation of miRJAW-resistant versions and
dominant-negative forms of TCPs have revealed function-
ally redundant roles for miRJAW-targeted CINCINNATA
(CIN)-TCP genes (TCP2-4, TCP10 and TCP24) in the control
of
leaf morphogenesis and senescence by modulating
jasmonate biosynthesis (Palatnik et al., 2003; Schommer
et al., 2008). Class II CIN-TCPs have also been shown to
regulate the morphogenesis of shoot lateral organs as well
as correct petal and stamen development (Palatnik et al.,

defense responses (Sugio et al., 2011).

Arabidopsis plants synthesize three classes of ﬂavo-
noids, including colorless to pale yellow ﬂavonols, red to
purple anthocyanins, and colorless proanthocyanidins,
which become brown upon oxidative reactions. Flavonoid
biosynthesis is largely regulated at
the transcriptional
level, and starts with the general phenylpropanoid metabo-
lism involving phenylalanine ammonia lyase, cinnamate
4-hydroxylase and 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (4CL). Molecu-
lar dissection of ﬂavonoid metabolism reveals that chal-
cone synthase (CHS), chalcone isomerase (CHI), ﬂavanone
3-hydroxylase (F3H) and ﬂavanone 3′-hydroxylase are
encoded by TRANSPARENT TESTA4 (TT4), TT5, TT6 and
TT7, respectively. Sequential reactions catalyzed by these
enzymes produce dihydroﬂavonols, the last common inter-
mediates in the biosynthesis of ﬂavonoid end-products
(Figure S1). Dihydroﬂavonols are then oxidized to ﬂavonols
by ﬂavonol synthase (FLS), such as quercetins and ka-
empferols. These early steps of the ﬂavonoid biosynthetic
pathway are controlled by the R2R3-MYB proteins MYB11,
MYB12 and MYB111, which activate the early biosynthetic
genes CHS, CHI, F3H and FLS1 (Mehrtens et al., 2005;
Stracke et al., 2007) (Figure S1). Dihydroﬂavonol 4-reduc-
tase (DFR), encoded by the late biosynthetic gene TT3,
reduces dihydroﬂavonols to leucoanthocyanidins, and
downstream enzymes participate in the production of an-
thocyanins and proanthocyanidins (Nesi et al., 2002; Ap-
(Figure S1). Three classes of
pelhagen et al., 2011)
regulatory proteins,
including R2R3-MYBs, bHLHs and
TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABROUS1 (TTG1/WD40), form
the ternary transcriptional
complex MYB-bHLH-WD40
(MBW), which activates several late ﬂavonoid biosynthetic
genes (Nesi et al., 2002; Appelhagen et al., 2011). Anthocy-
anin biosynthesis is regulated by an MBW complex con-
sisting of TTG1, one R2R3-MYB protein (PRODUCTION OF
ANTHOCYANIN PIGMENT1 (PAP1), PAP2, MYB113 or
MYB114), as well as one of the bHLH proteins TT8, GLA-
BROUS3 (GL3) or ENHANCER OF GLABRA3 (EGL3) (Gou
et al., 2011). Seed-speciﬁc activation of proanthocyanidin
production requires activity of an MBW complex compris-
ing the R2R3-MYB protein TT2, TT8 and TTG1 (Nesi et al.,
2002; Ramsay and Glover, 2005). Several transcription fac-
tors, such as the miR156-targeted SQUAMOSA PRO-
MOTER BINDING PROTEIN9 (SPL9),
the WIP-type zinc
ﬁnger protein TT1 and the R3-MYB protein MYBL2, have
been shown to interact with R2R3-MYBs or bHLHs to regu-
late ﬂavonoid biosynthesis, possibly by affecting the stabil-
ity of
the ternary MBW complex (Dubos et al., 2008;
Appelhagen et al., 2011; Gou et al., 2011).

Endogenous ﬂavonols are considered to be natural regu-
lators of cellular auxin efﬂux and polar auxin transport
(Murphy et al., 2000; Peer et al., 2004; Lazar and Goodman,
2006; Santelia et al., 2008; Petrasek and Friml, 2009).

Transcriptome analysis of young seedlings expressing the
inducible dominant-negative version of TCP3 (TCP3SRDX)
revealed an altered auxin response during Arabidopsis leaf
differentiation, such as up-regulation of PIN-FORMED1
(PIN1), PIN5 and PIN6 as well as down-regulation of PIN3,
PIN4 and PIN7 (Koyama et al., 2010a). In this work, trans-
genic plants expressing miRJAW-resistant mTCP3 and
dominant-negative TCP3SRDX were characterized through-
out the plant life cycle, and newly observed phenotypes
were further analyzed. Our results indicate that TCP3 stim-
ulates ﬂavonoid biosynthesis and negatively modulates
the auxin response, thereby causing a plethora of auxin-
related developmental defects.

RESULTS

Phenotypic analysis of transgenic plants expressing
mTCP3 and TCP3SRDX

Arabidopsis thaliana plants over-expressing TCP3 (p35S::
TCP3) as well as knockout mutants of TCP3 show no visible
phenotypic alterations as a consequence of miRJAW-
guided cleavage of TCP mRNAs and the functional redun-
dancy of TCP transcription factors (Table S1) (Koyama
et al., 2007). To reveal the developmental role of TCP3, the
miRJAW-resistant version mTCP3 and the dominant-nega-
tive repressor TCP3SRDX were engineered by synonymous
substitutions in the miRJAW target site and fusion of the
EAR motif repression domain to the TCP3 C-terminus,
respectively (Hiratsu et al. 2003; Palatnik et al., 2003). In
agreement with previous reports (Koyama et al., 2007),
24.2% of the p35S::mTCP3 plants formed fused cotyledons,
leading to early death within 4 days after germination
(Table S1), and 95.7% of the p35S::TCP3SRDX plants devel-
oped wavy leaves and irregular cotyledon vasculature
(Table S2). Additionally, the majority of the surviving trans-
genic plants (Tables S1 and S2) showed phenotypes that
were not observed previously, supporting further functions
for TCP3 during plant development. Wild-type and p35S::
TCP3SRDX transgenic plants formed a spiral phyllotaxy,
with an angle of 137.5° between the leaf initials (Figure 1a,
c). In contrast, 65.0% of the p35S::mTCP3 plants showed
decussate phyllotaxy, whereby each pair of leaves formed
a 90° angle with the previous pair (Figure 1b). In contrast
to the regular vascular patterns observed in wild-type coty-
ledons (Figure 1d), p35S::mTCP3 and p35S::TCP3SRDX
transgenic cotyledons developed irregular vascular xylem
strands (Figure 1e,f). Vascular breaks were also observed
for the ﬁrst true leaf expressing p35S::mTCP3 (Figure S2e).
p35S::mTCP3 plants showed reduced primary root growth
and formed fewer lateral roots (Figure 1h). By contrast,
p35S::TCP3SRDX plants (Figure 1i) developed more lateral
roots than wild-type plants (Figure 1g). Furthermore, trans-
genic plants expressing p35S::mTCP3 displayed a bushy
stature with reduced apical dominance, and developed a
