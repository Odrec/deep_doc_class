Karl Friston is a theoretical neuroscientist and 
authority on brain imaging. He invented statistical 
parametric mapping (SPM), voxel-based 
morphometry (VBM) and dynamic causal modelling 
(DCM). These contributions were motivated by 
schizophrenia research and theoretical studies of 
value-learning- formulated as the dysconnection 
hypothesis of schizophrenia. Mathematical 
contributions include variational Laplacian 
procedures and generalized filtering for hierarchical 
Bayesian model inversion. Friston currently works on 
models of functional integration in the human brain 
and the principles that underlie neuronal 
interactions. His main contribution to theoretical 
neurobiology is a free-energy principle for action and 
perception (active inference).

…a bird can act (to avoid

What is free-energy? 

…free-energy is basically prediction error 

sensations – predictions 

= prediction error 

where small errors mean low surprise 

More formally, 

Sensations 

Action 

External states 
in the world 

Internal states of 
the agent (m) 

Free-energy is a function of sensations and a recognition density over 
hidden causes 
 
 
 
and can be evaluated, given a generative model comprising a likelihood 
and prior: 
 
 
 
So what models might the brain use?
