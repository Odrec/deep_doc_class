1. Definition: ‘Constructed Language’ 

International ‘auxiliary’ 

(second) languages 

 

Languages created for the use 

in fiction 

• Internationally shared vocabulary 
• Grammars: much more systematic 

and regular than those of natural 
languages 

• Not intended for use outside the 

fictional context 

• Sketches of the language  

or 
Extensive vocabularies, grammars   

• Esperanto 
• Latino Sine Flexione 
• Interglossa / Glossa 
• Basic English 
• Globish 

• Elvish in Lord of the Rings 
• Klingon in Star Trek 
• Na’vi in Avatar 
• Dothraki in Games of Thrones 
• Simlish in Sims 

• Overlapping between the two types (cf. Newspeak) 
• Artificial languages haven’t really established

 

1. Why reduce English? 

2. Globish 

3. Basic Global English

5. Discussion 

8 

1. Why reduce English? 

 

 Key to world peace and economic growth 

 Sharing education, freedom, wealth and  happiness 

  

“Language is the most vital human means to 

transport and exchange information” 

 

9 

1. Why reduce English? 

 

 Peace: 

 requires a common feeling (e.g. a common language) 
 endangered through restricted individual thinking 

(different languages crucial) 

 understanding and communication 
 

 Economic growth: 

 sharing ideas 
 endangered through monocultural thinking 
 requires empathy for other people 
 

10 

1. Why reduce English? 

 

 Global triglossia: 
 mother tongue 
 global language 
 foreign language of choice 
 

 Global language: 

 English, Chinese, French, Spanish, artificial language 
 Global English (Globish, Basic Global English) 
 

11 

2. Globish 
 

 Invented by the French Jean-Paul Nerrière 
 System of “reduced” English: 

 Vocabulary of 1,500 words 
 Pronunciation should be understandable (not perfect) 
 simple standard grammatical rules 
 “threshold level of English”  
 tool to communicate anywhere                                       

in the world 

 

12 

2. Globish 
 

 phonology: 

 simplified, no strict rules 
 different stress 
 long and short vowels: globish ( ˈgloʊbɪʃ )  globish ( 

ˈglɑbɪʃ ) 

 th ignores the h: [θ]  [t] ; [ð]  [d] 
 

13 

2. Globish 
 

 grammar: 

 also no strict rules 
 e.g. progressive forms not mandatory 

  

 

I have served twenty years in the Navy. 

vs. 

I have been serving in the Navy for twenty years. 

14 

3. Basic Global English 

 

 invented by Joachim Grzega (German) 

 criticism of other reduced Englishes 

 main cause for communicative breakdown:    

phonetic or lexical mistakes (rarely grammatical) 

 major aspect ofBasic Global English: 

     teach pronunciation and vocabulary 

15 

3. Basic Global English 

 

Grammar: 
 20 basic rules 
 same present tense for all persons 

 She want instead of She wants 

 no article in front of nouns 
 avoid passive voice 
 eliminate pre- and postpositions 

 I‘ll pay the coffee instead of I‘ll pay for the coffee 

 

16 

3. Basic Global English 

 

I‘ve got less cars 

I look forward to see you tomorrow 

There‘s five cats in the picture 

I love not her 

I go next week 

17 

3. Basic Global English 

 

Sound and writing system: 
 Standard English alphabet 
 IPA transcription system 
 correct consonant sounds except for  /θ/ and /ð/  
 correct vowel quantitiy, not quality 
 aspiration after initial /p/, /t/ and /k/ 
 rhoticity (AmE) 
 /t/ (BrE) 

 

18 

3. Basic Global English 

 

Vocabulary: 
 750 words + 250 words of your own choice 
 no internationalisms 
 word-formation: conversion, affixation, 

compounding 
 paraphrasing 
 be aware of false friends 
 no metaphors 

19 

3. Basic Global English 

 

Politeness strategies: 
 12 rules 
 positive words (good – not good) 
 respect for other cultures‘ values 
 colloquial speech (not too complex) 
 formal situations 

 Yes, please and No, thank you 
 Could you open the window? instead of Open the window. 
 I suggest that we… instead of Let‘s do… 

20 

3. Basic Global English 

 

Educational aspects: 
 don‘t correct every mistake 
 observe your mother tongue (similarities, 

differences) 

 easy learning: BGE can be covered in 30 hours

5. Discussion 

 

 

Is Globish just bad English? 

Do we need a global language? 

24 

Newspeak 
 

1. General information 

 

2. Linguistic features 
2.1. General purpose 
2.2. Semantic reduction 
2.3. Morphology 
2.4. Types of vocabulary 
 

3. Discussion 

26 

1. General information 

 

 ‘Constructed language’ in George Orwell’s 1984 (1946) 
   Language created for the use in fiction 
 
 Official language of Oceania 

 

 Invented for the ideological needs of ‘Ingsoc’,  
 

English Socialism 

27 

1. General information 

 

 Information on the novel 
 
 Division of the world into three blocs: Oceania, Eurasia 

& Eastasia 

 
 Protagonist: Winston Smith 

 

 Totalitarian government: Individuals are suffering 

from constant surveillance 
 
 

28 

29 

1. General information 

 

•1984 was published (context: Cold War) 

•Only specialists used ‘Newspeak’ 

1946 

1984 

•Expectation: ‘Newspeak’ has replaced 

2050 

‘Oldspeak’ (Standard English) 

International ‘auxiliary’ (second) language 
  Overlapping of the two categories 
 

30 

1. General information 

 

 Based on Standard English 
   a posteriori artificial language 
 
 

 
BUT: Difficult to understand for English- 
speakers in those days  
 

 

     

31 

2.1. General purpose 

 

 
 

“Newspeak was designed not to extend but 

to diminish the range of thought, […].” 

 
 
 
 
 
Source: Orwell, G. 1946. “The Principles of Newspeak”. In:  Orwell, Georges. 1946. 1984. New 

York: Signet Classics. 

32 

2.2. Semantic reduction 

 

“Its vocabulary was so constructed as to give exact and 
often very subtle expression to every meaning that a 
Party member could properly wish to express, while 
excluding all other meaning and also the possibility of 
arriving at them by indirect methods.”  

 
“This was done partly by the invention of new words, but 

chiefly by eliminating undesirable words and stripping 
such words as remained of unorthodox meanings, and 
so far as possible of all secondary meaning whatever.” 

 
 
Source: Orwell, G. 1946. “The Principles of Newspeak”. In:  Orwell, Georges. 1946. 

1984. New York: Signet Classics. 

33 

 
 

2.2. Semantic reduction 

 

Example 
 
“The dog is free from lice.” 
 
‘free’: the dog has no lice 
 
 
 

  NOT: ‘politically free’; ‘intellectually free’  

Source: Orwell, G. 1946. “The Principles of Newspeak”. In:  Orwell, Georges. 1946.   1984. New York: 

Signet   Classics. 

34 

 
 

2.2 Semantic reduction 

 

 Omnipresence of “ready-made phrases” 

 

 No relation between words and their meanings 

 

 Speaker does not think on his own → becomes a 

machine 
 

 Newspeak reflects the political ideology 

 
 
 

35 

2.2 Semantic reduction 

 

 Newspeak as a form of (elite) jargon 

 

 
 Symbolizes orthodoxy in 1984 

 

 
 Tendency to prefabrication of sentences → jargon of a 

certain field/profession always has a vocabulary which 
is often known before an utterance is made 
 
 

36 

2.3. Morphology  

 

 
 

 

noun 
verb 
adjective   
adverb 

Any word could be used as  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
thinkful 
 

think 
to think; thinked 

thinkwise 

37 

2.3. Morphology  

 

think   

thinked 

Suffixes 
‘-ed’ used to form past tense and past participle: 
 
 
‘-ful’ used to form an adjective: 
 
 
 
‘-wise’ used to form an adverb: 
 
thinkwise 
 
 

think   
rapid   

thinkful 
speedful 

think   

 

38 

2.3. Morphology  

 

Suffixes 
‘-s’/ ‘-es’ used to form plural: 
 
  man 
 
‘-er’ / ‘-est’ for comparision; no irregular forms and forms 

oxes 
mans 

ox  

 
 

with ‘more’ / ‘most’: 
good, gooder; goodest 

 
 
 
 

39 

2.3. Morphology  

 

good – plusgood 

good – better   

Prefixes: 
‘plus-’ as intensifier instead of ‘more’ / ‘-er’: 
 
 
‘doubleplus’ as further intensification of ‘plus’: 
 
 
‘Un-’ for negation, e.g. ‘warm’  ‘uncold’ 
 
 
 
 

      ‘bad’  ‘ungood’ 

good – better – best  good – plusgood – doubleplusgood 

 

 

 

40 

2.3 Morphology 

 

 Compounding: 

 

  Compounding as a structural preference of 
Newspeak → ex.: “Newspeak”, “unperson” 
 

 Creation of compounds based on the same root → 

ex.: “good”, “ungood”, “plusgood”, 
“doubleplusgood” 
 

41 

2.3 Morphology 

 

 Important compounds: 

 

 Doublethink → 2+2=5 

 

 Thoughtcrime → “crime” not yet been put into practice 

 

 “crime”= beliefs/doubts that oppose or question the 

ruling regime 
 

 

42 

2.4. Types of Vocabulary 

 

Three classes of vocabulary: 
 
  A vocabulary 
 
 
 
 

C vocabulary 

B vocabulary 

43 

2.4. Types of Vocabulary 

 

A vocabulary: 
 Small number of words 
 Simple concepts (meanings) 
 Borrowed from English 

 

 Words needed in everyday life: 

  hit, run, dog, tree, sugar, house, field 

 
 

44 

2.4. Types of Vocabulary 

 

B vocabulary: 
 Words for political purposes – euphemisms: 

  ‘Minipax’  (= Ministry of Peace, i.e. Ministry of War) 
 

 Abbreviations (often used in totalitarian systems): 
Ministry of Truth  ‘Record Department’  ‘Recdep’ 

 
 Compound words: noun-verb: 
(=‘orthodoxy’)  

  ‘goodthink’ 
 
 

45 

2.4. Types of Vocabulary 

 

C vocabulary: 
 Technical words  
 Additional to A and B vocabulary 

 

 No word for the concept ‘science’ 
 Fields have their own words; rather unconnected 

 

 
 

46 

Inconveniences of Newspeak 

 

 Loss of flexibility of meaning 

 

 Limited vocabulary 

 

 Natural human language → infinitely creative 

 

 Restriction of this creativity in Newspeak 

47 

3. Discussion 

 

“George Orwell’s 1984  is the expression of a mood, and it 

is a warning. The mood it expresses is that of near 
despair about the future of man, and the warning is that 
unless the course of history changes, men all over the 
world will lose their most human qualities, will become 
soulless automatons, and will not even be aware of it.”
