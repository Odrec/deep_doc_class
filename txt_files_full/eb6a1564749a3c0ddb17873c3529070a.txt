what is modeling? 

„a set of ideas that describes a natural 
process and can be used to explain a 

specific set of phenomena”  

(Cartier, Rudolph & Stewart 1999) 

 

 
 
Approaches of modelling human performance in 
interactive behaviour: 
GOMS, EPIC, EPIC-Soar, ACT-R

Prediction using the model works: 

 

 

 

 

 

what else can the model be used 

for? 

diagnosis 

bracketing: 

predicting an upper and lower limit for the 

expected data; 

 profiling: 

find the microstrategy which was most probably 

used; 

 analysis: 

analyse why the used strategy differs from the 

best; 

 

 

a problem with the technology design ? 

 

what you should remember 

about microstrategies 

● different microstrategies in the same 

task context 

● microstrategy selection is nondeliberate 

● explicit verifications have to be 

eliminated for faster microstrategies  

● improve predictions of performance by 

using microstrategies 

● microstrategies can be used for diagnosis 

implications:  
why milliseconds matter 

milliseconds add up!! 

in our text we had between 22% and 560% time 
increase between slowest and fastest microstrategy. 

 

 

best case: the interface feels sluggish and 
nonresponsive. 

worst case: this sluggish response or user-
attempts to avoid it result in higher workload 
and increased errors. 

microstrategies can also be used to evaluate new 
technologies. 

New workstation 

Project Ernestine (1980s) 

 
new workstation: 

•880msec faster appears the screen 

information 

 

•fewer keystrokes 

removed not from 

critical path 

added to critical path! 

 

 
 

•4,1 seconds per call = saves $12,3 

million per year! 

 

0,6 seconds slower 

=  

$2 million per 

year! 

GOMS - advantages and 

weaknesses 

advantages: 
• little effort 

• little cost 

weaknesses: 
● unpredictability of the 

user (behaviour affected 

• not time consuming 
 
 

by fatigue, social 

surrounding, 

organizational factors) 

● do not allow error 

● imply expert users, not 

novices
