Abstract The thesis of the extended mind (ExM) holds that the material under-
pinnings of an individual’s mental states and processes need not be restricted to
those contained within biological boundaries: when conditions are right, material
artefacts can be incorporated by the thinking subject in such a way as to become a
component of her extended mind. Up to this point, the focus of this approach has
been on phenomena of a distinctively cognitive nature, such as states of disposi-
tional belief, and processes of planning and calculation. In this paper, we aim to
expand the scope of ExM by considering the case for extended affectivity. We begin
by clarifying the central commitments of ExM, before investigating its applicability
to a range of affective phenomena, both dispositional and occurrent. We argue that
proponents of ExM should also accept that the vehicles of emotions, moods, sen-
timents, temperaments, and character traits can extend beyond skull and skin.

1 Introduction

According to the thesis of the extended mind (ExM henceforth), under certain
circumstances we should see the material vehicles that realize the mind as
encompassing not just brain activity, but also that of the body and the material
environment. This ‘‘vehicle externalist’’ thesis was formulated by Clark and
Chalmers (1998) and has been further elaborated by Andy Clark in subsequent
works (e.g., Clark 2003, 2008, 2010a, b), partly in response to critical engagement
by those sympathetic to internalism (for example by Adams and Aizawa 2001,
2010a, b; Rupert 2004; Weiskopf 2008).
