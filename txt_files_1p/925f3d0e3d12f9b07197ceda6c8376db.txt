Supreme Court of the United States

v.

reasoned judgment in identifying interests of the person
so   fundamental   that   the   State   must   accord   them   its
respect. . . .

et al.;

Argued April 28, 2015.
Decided June 26, 2015.

Justice KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.

The Constitution promises liberty to all within its
reach, a liberty that includes certain specific rights that
allow   persons,   within   a   lawful   realm,   to   define   and
express their identity. The petitioners in these cases seek
to find that liberty by marrying someone of the same sex
and having their marriages deemed lawful on the same
terms and conditions as marriages between persons of the
opposite sex.

I

These cases come from Michigan, Kentucky, Ohio,
and Tennessee, States that define marriage  as a union
between   one   man   and   one   woman.   See,  e.g.,  Mich.
Const., Art. I, § 25; Ky. Const. § 233A; Ohio Rev.Code
Ann. § 3101.01 (Lexis 2008); Tenn. Const., Art. XI, § 18.
The petitioners are 14 same-sex couples and two men
whose same-sex partners are deceased. The respondents
are state officials responsible for enforcing the laws in
question. The petitioners claim the respondents violate the
Fourteenth  Amendment   by   denying   them   the   right   to
marry or to have their marriages, lawfully performed in
another State, given full recognition. . . . 

III

Under   the   Due   Process   Clause   of   the   Fourteenth
Amendment, no State shall “deprive any person of life,
liberty,   or  property,  without  due  process  of   law.”  The
fundamental   liberties   protected   by  this   Clause   include
most of the rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights. See
Duncan v. Louisiana,  391 U.S. 145, 147–149, 88 S.Ct.
1444, 20 L.Ed.2d 491 (1968). In addition these liberties
extend to certain personal choices central to individual
dignity   and   autonomy,   including   intimate   choices   that
define personal identity and beliefs. See, e.g., Eisenstadt
v. Baird,  405 U.S. 438, 453, 92 S.Ct. 1029, 31 L.Ed.2d
349 (1972); Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 484–
486, 85 S.Ct. 1678, 14 L.Ed.2d 510 (1965).

The   identification   and   protection   of   fundamental
rights is an enduring part of the judicial duty to interpret
the Constitution. That responsibility, however, “has not
been reduced to any formula.”  Poe v. Ullman,  367 U.S.
497, 542, 81 S.Ct. 1752, 6 L.Ed.2d 989 (1961) (Harlan,
J.,   dissenting).   Rather,   it   requires   courts   to   exercise

Applying these established tenets, the Court has long
held the right to marry is protected by the Constitution. In
Loving v. Virginia,  388 U.S. 1, 12, 87 S.Ct. 1817, 18
L.Ed.2d   1010   (1967),   which   invalidated   bans   on
interracial unions, a unanimous Court held marriage is
“one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly
pursuit of happiness by free men.” The Court reaffirmed
that holding in Zablocki v. Redhail, 434 U.S. 374, 384, 98
S.Ct. 673, 54 L.Ed.2d 618 (1978), which held the right to
marry was burdened by a law prohibiting fathers who
were behind on child support from marrying. The Court
again applied this principle in Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S.
78, 95, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987), which held
the right to marry was abridged by regulations limiting
the privilege of prison inmates to marry. Over time and in
other contexts, the Court has reiterated that the right to
marry is fundamental under the Due Process Clause. See,
e.g., M.L.B. v. S.L. J., 519 U.S. 102, 116, 117 S.Ct. 555,
136 L.Ed.2d 473 (1996); Cleveland Bd. of Ed. v. LaFleur,
414 U.S. 632, 639–640, 94 S.Ct. 791, 39 L.Ed.2d 52
(1974); Griswold, supra, at 486; Skinner v. Oklahoma ex
rel. Williamson,  316 U.S. 535, 541, 62 S.Ct. 1110, 86
L.Ed. 1655 (1942);  Meyer v. Nebraska,  262 U.S. 390,
399, 43 S.Ct. 625, 67 L.Ed. 1042 (1923).

It cannot be denied that this Court's cases describing
the   right   to   marry   presumed   a   relationship   involving
opposite-sex partners. The Court, like many institutions,
has made assumptions defined by the world and time of
which it is a part. . . . 

Still,   there   are   other,   more   instructive   precedents.
This   Court's   cases   have   expressed   constitutional
principles of broader reach. In defining the right to marry
these cases have identified essential attributes of that right
based   in   history,   tradition,   and   other   constitutional
liberties   inherent   in   this   intimate   bond.   See,
 e.g.,
Lawrence,  539   U.S.,   at   574;  Turner,   supra,  at   95;
Zablocki, supra, at 384; Loving, supra, at 12; Griswold,
supra,  at 486. And in assessing whether the force and
rationale of its cases apply to same-sex couples, the Court
must respect the basic reasons why the right to marry has
been long protected. See, e.g., Eisenstadt, supra, at 453–
454; Poe, supra, at 542–553 (Harlan, J., dissenting).

This analysis compels the conclusion that same-sex
couples   may   exercise   the   right   to   marry.   The   four
principles and traditions to be discussed demonstrate that
the   reasons   marriage   is   fundamental   under   the
Constitution apply with equal force to same-sex couples.
