SUMMARY

TCP proteins belong to the plant-speciﬁc bHLH transcription factor family, and function as key regulators of
diverse developmental processes. Functional redundancy amongst family members and post-transcriptional
down-regulation by miRJAW of several TCP genes complicate their functional characterization. Here, we
explore the role of TCP3 by analyzing transgenic plants expressing miRJAW-resistant mTCP3 and dominant-
negative TCP3SRDX. Seedlings and seeds of mTCP3 plants were found to hyper-accumulate ﬂavonols, an-
thocyanins and proanthocyanidins, whereas levels of proanthocyanidins were slightly reduced in TCP3SRDX
plants. R2R3-MYB proteins control not only early ﬂavonoid biosynthetic steps but also activate late ﬂavo-
noid biosynthetic genes by forming ternary R2R3-MYB/bHLH/WD40 (MBW) complexes. TCP3 interacted in
yeast with R2R3-MYB proteins, which was further conﬁrmed in planta using BiFC experiments. Yeast three-
hybrid assays revealed that TCP3 signiﬁcantly strengthened the transcriptional activation capacity of R2R3-
MYBs bound by the bHLH protein TT8. Transcriptome analysis of mTCP3 and TCP3SRDX plants supported a
role for TCP3 in enhancing ﬂavonoid biosynthesis. Moreover, several auxin-related developmental abnor-
malities were observed in mTCP3 plants. Transcriptome data coupled with studies of an auxin response
reporter and auxin efﬂux carriers showed that TCP3 negatively modulates the auxin response, probably by
compromising auxin transport capacity. Genetic experiments revealed that the chalcone synthase mutant
tt4-11 lacking ﬂavonoid biosynthesis abrogated the auxin-related defects caused by mTCP3. Together, these
data suggest that TCP3 interactions with R2R3-MYBs lead to enhanced ﬂavonoid production, which further
negatively modulates the auxin response.

INTRODUCTION

The plant-speciﬁc TCP family of transcription factors is
named after the ﬁrst three identiﬁed members: TEOSINTE
BRANCHED1 in maize (Zea mays), CYCLOIDEA (CYC) in
Antirrhinum majus, and PROLIFERATING CELL NUCLEAR
ANTIGEN FACTOR in rice (Oryza sativa). Repeated gene
duplications during land plant evolution have enlarged this
family of bHLH-containing DNA-binding proteins (Martın-
Trillo and Cubas, 2010). The Arabidopsis thaliana genome
encodes 24 TCP transcription factors. Based on the struc-
ture of their conserved TCP domains, 13 TCP proteins have
been identiﬁed as members of class I (TCP-P) and have
been suggested to function as positive regulators of cell
proliferation (Kosugi and Ohashi, 2002). The other 11 TCP
proteins belong to class II (TCP-C). CYC controls ﬂoral sym-
metry formation in Antirrhinum (Luo et al., 1996), and its
Arabidopsis ortholog TCP1 participates in brassinosteroid

biosynthesis and modulates longitudinal elongation of
leaves and stems (Guo et al., 2010; Koyama et al., 2010b).
The products of
II/TCP-C genes, TCP12
(BRANCHED2) and TCP18 (BRANCHED1), operate as inte-
grators of branching signals within axillary buds (Aguilar-
Martinez et al., 2007), and TCP12 has also been shown to
repress the ﬂoral transition of axillary meristems (Niwa
et al., 2013). Generation of miRJAW-resistant versions and
dominant-negative forms of TCPs have revealed function-
ally redundant roles for miRJAW-targeted CINCINNATA
(CIN)-TCP genes (TCP2-4, TCP10 and TCP24) in the control
of
leaf morphogenesis and senescence by modulating
jasmonate biosynthesis (Palatnik et al., 2003; Schommer
et al., 2008). Class II CIN-TCPs have also been shown to
regulate the morphogenesis of shoot lateral organs as well
as correct petal and stamen development (Palatnik et al.,

2003; Koyama et al., 2007, 2010a; Nag et al., 2009) and
defense responses (Sugio et al., 2011).

Arabidopsis plants synthesize three classes of ﬂavo-
noids, including colorless to pale yellow ﬂavonols, red to
purple anthocyanins, and colorless proanthocyanidins,
which become brown upon oxidative reactions. Flavonoid
biosynthesis is largely regulated at
the transcriptional
level, and starts with the general phenylpropanoid metabo-
lism involving phenylalanine ammonia lyase, cinnamate
4-hydroxylase and 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (4CL). Molecu-
lar dissection of ﬂavonoid metabolism reveals that chal-
cone synthase (CHS), chalcone isomerase (CHI), ﬂavanone
3-hydroxylase (F3H) and ﬂavanone 3′-hydroxylase are
encoded by TRANSPARENT TESTA4 (TT4), TT5, TT6 and
TT7, respectively. Sequential reactions catalyzed by these
enzymes produce dihydroﬂavonols, the last common inter-
mediates in the biosynthesis of ﬂavonoid end-products
(Figure S1). Dihydroﬂavonols are then oxidized to ﬂavonols
by ﬂavonol synthase (FLS), such as quercetins and ka-
empferols. These early steps of the ﬂavonoid biosynthetic
pathway are controlled by the R2R3-MYB proteins MYB11,
MYB12 and MYB111, which activate the early biosynthetic
genes CHS, CHI, F3H and FLS1 (Mehrtens et al., 2005;
Stracke et al., 2007) (Figure S1). Dihydroﬂavonol 4-reduc-
tase (DFR), encoded by the late biosynthetic gene TT3,
reduces dihydroﬂavonols to leucoanthocyanidins, and
downstream enzymes participate in the production of an-
thocyanins and proanthocyanidins (Nesi et al., 2002; Ap-
(Figure S1). Three classes of
pelhagen et al., 2011)
regulatory proteins,
including R2R3-MYBs, bHLHs and
TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABROUS1 (TTG1/WD40), form
the ternary transcriptional
complex MYB-bHLH-WD40
(MBW), which activates several late ﬂavonoid biosynthetic
genes (Nesi et al., 2002; Appelhagen et al., 2011). Anthocy-
anin biosynthesis is regulated by an MBW complex con-
sisting of TTG1, one R2R3-MYB protein (PRODUCTION OF
ANTHOCYANIN PIGMENT1 (PAP1), PAP2, MYB113 or
MYB114), as well as one of the bHLH proteins TT8, GLA-
BROUS3 (GL3) or ENHANCER OF GLABRA3 (EGL3) (Gou
et al., 2011). Seed-speciﬁc activation of proanthocyanidin
production requires activity of an MBW complex compris-
ing the R2R3-MYB protein TT2, TT8 and TTG1 (Nesi et al.,
2002; Ramsay and Glover, 2005). Several transcription fac-
tors, such as the miR156-targeted SQUAMOSA PRO-
MOTER BINDING PROTEIN9 (SPL9),
the WIP-type zinc
ﬁnger protein TT1 and the R3-MYB protein MYBL2, have
been shown to interact with R2R3-MYBs or bHLHs to regu-
late ﬂavonoid biosynthesis, possibly by affecting the stabil-
ity of
the ternary MBW complex (Dubos et al., 2008;
Appelhagen et al., 2011; Gou et al., 2011).

Endogenous ﬂavonols are considered to be natural regu-
lators of cellular auxin efﬂux and polar auxin transport
(Murphy et al., 2000; Peer et al., 2004; Lazar and Goodman,
2006; Santelia et al., 2008; Petrasek and Friml, 2009).

Transcriptome analysis of young seedlings expressing the
inducible dominant-negative version of TCP3 (TCP3SRDX)
revealed an altered auxin response during Arabidopsis leaf
differentiation, such as up-regulation of PIN-FORMED1
(PIN1), PIN5 and PIN6 as well as down-regulation of PIN3,
PIN4 and PIN7 (Koyama et al., 2010a). In this work, trans-
genic plants expressing miRJAW-resistant mTCP3 and
dominant-negative TCP3SRDX were characterized through-
out the plant life cycle, and newly observed phenotypes
were further analyzed. Our results indicate that TCP3 stim-
ulates ﬂavonoid biosynthesis and negatively modulates
the auxin response, thereby causing a plethora of auxin-
related developmental defects.

RESULTS

Phenotypic analysis of transgenic plants expressing
mTCP3 and TCP3SRDX

Arabidopsis thaliana plants over-expressing TCP3 (p35S::
TCP3) as well as knockout mutants of TCP3 show no visible
phenotypic alterations as a consequence of miRJAW-
guided cleavage of TCP mRNAs and the functional redun-
dancy of TCP transcription factors (Table S1) (Koyama
et al., 2007). To reveal the developmental role of TCP3, the
miRJAW-resistant version mTCP3 and the dominant-nega-
tive repressor TCP3SRDX were engineered by synonymous
substitutions in the miRJAW target site and fusion of the
EAR motif repression domain to the TCP3 C-terminus,
respectively (Hiratsu et al. 2003; Palatnik et al., 2003). In
agreement with previous reports (Koyama et al., 2007),
24.2% of the p35S::mTCP3 plants formed fused cotyledons,
leading to early death within 4 days after germination
(Table S1), and 95.7% of the p35S::TCP3SRDX plants devel-
oped wavy leaves and irregular cotyledon vasculature
(Table S2). Additionally, the majority of the surviving trans-
genic plants (Tables S1 and S2) showed phenotypes that
were not observed previously, supporting further functions
for TCP3 during plant development. Wild-type and p35S::
TCP3SRDX transgenic plants formed a spiral phyllotaxy,
with an angle of 137.5° between the leaf initials (Figure 1a,
c). In contrast, 65.0% of the p35S::mTCP3 plants showed
decussate phyllotaxy, whereby each pair of leaves formed
a 90° angle with the previous pair (Figure 1b). In contrast
to the regular vascular patterns observed in wild-type coty-
ledons (Figure 1d), p35S::mTCP3 and p35S::TCP3SRDX
transgenic cotyledons developed irregular vascular xylem
strands (Figure 1e,f). Vascular breaks were also observed
for the ﬁrst true leaf expressing p35S::mTCP3 (Figure S2e).
p35S::mTCP3 plants showed reduced primary root growth
and formed fewer lateral roots (Figure 1h). By contrast,
p35S::TCP3SRDX plants (Figure 1i) developed more lateral
roots than wild-type plants (Figure 1g). Furthermore, trans-
genic plants expressing p35S::mTCP3 displayed a bushy
stature with reduced apical dominance, and developed a

Figure 1. Phenotypes of mTCP3 and TCP3SRDX plants.
(a–c) Ten-day-old wild-type (a) and TCP3SRDX plants (c) show a normal spiral phyllotaxy, whereas mTCP3 plants show a decussate phyllotaxy (b). Twenty-ﬁve
independent plants were examined for each genotype.
(d–f) Wild-type cotyledons formed four loops of xylem strands emanating from a mid-vein (d). In contrast, mTCP3 (e) and TCP3SRDX cotyledons (f) developed
discontinuous vascular xylem strands. Thirty cotyledons from 15 independent 10-day-old plants were analyzed.
(g–i) Compared to 12-day-old wild-type roots (g), mTCP3 plants exhibited reduced primary root growth and formed fewer lateral roots (h), whereas TCP3SRDX
plants formed more lateral roots (i). Twenty-ﬁve 12-day-old plants were analyzed for each genotype.
(j–l) mTCP3 transgenic plants produced smaller dark brown seeds (k), whereas TCP3SRDX plants produced pale brown seeds (l) that were similar in size to the
brown seeds of wild-type plants (j).Twenty-ﬁve plants were examined for each genotype.

mean of 29 shoots of similar length at maturity (Fig-
ure 1m), in contrast to seven and nine shoots for wild-type
and p35S::TCP3SRDX-expressing plants, respectively (Fig-
ure 1m; 25 plants analyzed). Compared to the brown wild-
type seeds (Figure 1j), plants harboring p35S::mTCP3
developed smaller and darker brown seeds (Figure 1k). In
contrast,
transgenic plants expressing p35S::TCP3SRDX
formed pale brown seeds (Figure 1l) that were similar in
size to wild-type seeds (Figure 1j). Additionally, p35S::
mTCP3 plants produced smaller dark-green leaves without
an obvious distinction between the leaf petiole and the leaf
lamina (Figure S2b), smaller petals (Figure S2j), shorter in-
ﬂorescences with reduced internode lengths, and shorter
siliques with a defect in ﬂoral organ abscission (Figure
S2 m,q), as well as thinner green stems and thinner roots
(Figure S2r,u). In addition to developing bigger leaves and
petals with wavy margins as well as crinkled siliques
(Koyama et al., 2007) (Figure S2c,l,p), p35S::TCP3SRDX-
expressing plants also formed irregular bulges on the
adaxial side of leaves (Figure S2c).

The miRJAW-resistant version of TCP3SRDX was also
generated, and expression of the p35S::mTCP3SRDX con-
struct in wild-type plants produced the same phenotypes
as observed in p35S::TCP3SRDX plants (Table S2). To
exclude exogenous effects caused by ubiquitous expres-
sion driven by the CaMV 35S promoter, both miRJAW-
resistant and -sensitive versions of TCP3 and TCP3SRDX

were also expressed in the context of the TCP3 locus
(pTCP3::TCP3, pTCP3::mTCP3, pTCP3::TCP3SRDX and
pTCP3::mTCP3SRDX). Phenotypic investigation of
these
transgenic populations revealed similar activities of the
CaMV 35S promoter and TCP3 regulatory sequences
(Tables S1 and S2), as supported by the observation that
the TCP3 promoter drives a ubiquitous GUS expression
(Figure S3). Further analysis was therefore focused on
p35S::mTCP3 and p35S::TCP3SRDX plants.

Analysis of young mTCP3 seedlings conﬁrmed the fused
cotelydon phenotype described by Koyama et al. (2007),
and further observation of surviving transgenic plants
revealed diverse phenotypes that were not reported pre-
viously, such as altered leaf phyllotaxy, defects in vascular
patterning, reduced apical dominance, bushy architecture,
and impaired root growth and development, as well as
reduced organ size, implicating a possible role for TCP3 in
auxin biosynthesis or signaling.

Flavonoid accumulation in mTCP3 and TCP3SRDX
transgenic plants

In p35S::mTCP3 seedlings, hyper-accumulation of purple
pigments was observed at the junction between the elon-
gated hypocotyl and cotyledons (Figures 1h and 2b),
whereas the corresponding junctions of wild-type and p35S::
TCP3SRDX plants were green (Figures 1g,i and 2a,c). Antho-
cyanin contents were not signiﬁcantly affected in p35S::

Figure 2. Flavonoid accumulation in mTCP3 and TCP3SRDX plants.
(a–c) Eight-day-old seedlings expressing mTCP3 accumulated purple anthocyanin pigments in the junction region between the elongated hypocotyl and cotyle-
dons (b, arrow), whereas the junction region of TCP3SRDX and wild-type plants was green (a,c). Twenty independent plants were examined for each genotype.
Scale bars = 0.5 cm.
(d) Compared with wild-type seedlings, levels of anthocyanins and ﬂavonols were >9-fold (P < 0.001) and 3.68-fold higher (P < 0.001), respectively, in mTCP3
seedlings, but were not signiﬁcantly affected in TCP3SRDX seedlings (P = 0.16 and P = 2.12, respectively). Fifty miligrams of 8-day-old seedlings and 20 inde-
pendent 6-day-old seedlings were used for anthocyanin and ﬂavonol quantiﬁcation, respectively. Three replicates were performed.
(e–m) Hyper-accumulation of ﬂavonols in the cotyledonary node (f), the hypocotyl–root transition zone (i) and the root tip (l) was observed in DPBA-stained 6-
day-old mTCP3 plants. In contrast, ﬂavonol levels in TCP3SRDX plants (g,j,m) were similar to those observed in DPBA-stained wild-type plants (e,h,k). Twenty
independent plants were examined for each genotype. Arrows indicate the hypocotyl–root transition zone. Scale bars = 0.5 cm (e–g) and 0.2 cm (h–m).
(n–p) Proanthocyanidins and their precursors were stained dark red with vanillin in the endothelium of wild-type immature seeds (n). Expression of mTCP3
increased production of proanthocyanidins in the endothelium and the outer seed coat layers (o). Conversely, TCP3SRDX seeds showed reduced accumulation
of these products in the endothelium (p). Fifty immature seeds from ten independent plants of each genotype (ﬁve immature seeds per plant) were tested. ol,

TCP3SRDX seedlings but were ninefold enhanced in p35S::
mTCP3 seedlings compared to wild-type (Figure 2d). The ﬂa-
vonol accumulation in the cotyledonary node, the hypo-
cotyl–root transition zone and the root tip of wild-type and
transgenic seedlings was analyzed using the ﬂavonol-spe-
ciﬁc dye diphenylboric acid-2-aminoethyl ester (DPBA). Sig-
niﬁcantly increased ﬂavonol levels in these three regions
were observed in p35S::mTCP3 plants (Figure 2d,f,i,l). By
contrast, the ﬂavonol level of p35S::TCP3SRDX plants (Fig-
ure 2d,g,j,m) was similar to that of wild-type seedlings (Fig-
ure 2d,e,h,k). Proanthocyanidins belong to the third group of
ﬂavonoids and are located speciﬁcally in the innermost cell
layer of the seed coat, the endothelium (Devic et al., 1999).
Uncolored proanthocyanidins and their precursors in the
endothelium of immature wild-type seeds were stained dark
red by vanillin staining (Figure 2n). Expression of mTCP3
caused not only increased accumulation of proanthocyani-
dins in the endothelium, but also ectopic deposition in the
outer layers of the seed coat (Figure 2o), which accounts for
the dark brown color of mature transgenic seeds (Figure 1k).
Conversely, TCP3SRDX seeds exhibited reduced levels of
these products in the endothelium (Figure 2p), consistent
with the attenuated brown coloration observed in mature
seeds (Figure 1l). Collectively, hyper-accumulation of antho-
cyanins, proanthocyanidins and ﬂavonols in mTCP3 plants,

as well as reduced levels of proanthocyanidins in TCP3SRDX
plants, indicate that TCP3 probably participates in regulation
of the ﬂavonoid biosynthetic pathway.

Auxin response of mTCP3 and TCP3SRDX transgenic
plants

The observed auxin-related developmental defects of
mTCP3 plants prompted us to compare the expression pat-
tern of the auxin response reporter pDR5::GUS in wild-
type, mTCP3 and TCP3SRDX plants. The pDR5::GUS repor-
ter was mainly expressed at the apices and vascular tis-
sues of wild-type leaves (Figure 3a,e)
(Mattsson et al.,
1999). Relative to wild-type plants (Figure 3a,d), expression
of mTCP3 induced a theeefold reduction in the pDR5::GUS
reporter activity (Figure 3b,d). Transgenic plants express-
ing TCP3SRDX showed no signiﬁcant changes in reporter
activity (Figure 3c,d). To investigate whether addition of
exogenous auxin is able to rescue the reduced auxin
response observed in mTCP3 plants, wild-type, mTCP3 and
TCP3SRDX plantlets expressing pDR5::GUS were exposed
for 15 h prior to GUS staining to 1-naphthaleneacetic acid
(NAA), which is more long-lived than indole-3-acetic acid
(IAA). Incubation of mTCP3 seedlings in the presence of
NAA did not result in increased activity of the pDR5::GUS
reporter (Figure 3d,g,h), in contrast with the signiﬁcantly

Figure 3. Expression of auxin-responsive genes in mTCP3 and TCP3SRDX plants.
(a–c) The auxin-responsive pDR5::GUS reporter showed weaker GUS expression in 10-day-old mTCP3 plants (b) compared to wild-type (a) and TCP3SRDX
plants (c). Twenty independent plants were examined for each genotype. Bars in (a)-(c) = 0.5 cm.
(d) GUS enzymatic activity was about threefold lower in mTCP3 transgenic plants compared to wild-type plants (P < 0.001, ***) and not signiﬁcantly altered in
TCP3SRDX plants (black bars). To test the effect of NAA on expression of the pDR5::GUS reporter, seedlings were transferred 5 d after germination from normal
agar growth medium to plates containing just the NAA solvent 1.7910-7 M NaOH (- NAA, gray bars) or on medium with NAA (white bars) and GUS enzymatic
activity was determined 15 h later. Incubation of mTCP3 seedlings in NAA (gray versus white bars) did not lead to increased expression of the pDR5::GUS repor-
ter, contrasting with signiﬁcantly elevated reporter expression in wild-type (P < 0.001, ***) and TCP3SRDX plants (P < 0.001, ***). Twenty mg fresh tissue was
used for quantiﬁcation of GUS activity for each genotype and three replicates were performed.
(e–j) Treatment of mTCP3 seedlings with NAA did not affect expression of the pDR5::GUS reporter (g versus h), contrasting with heightened expression in
wild-type (e versus f) and TCP3SRDX plants (i versus j). Twenty independent plants were analyzed for each genotype and representative images of the ﬁrst true
leaves were shown. Bars = 0.2 cm.

elevated expression of
this reporter in wild-type (Fig-
ure 3d,e,f) and TCP3SRDX plants (Figure 3d,i,j). These
results suggest that expression of mTCP3 reduces auxin
transport capacity and/or sensitivity.

Membrane-localized PIN proteins are known to mediate
polar auxin transport, and visualization of these proteins
fused to GFP allows detailed characterization of their distri-
bution and abundance (Teale et al., 2006). To further deﬁne
the effect of expressing mTCP3 on auxin transport, func-
tional pPIN1::PIN1-GFP and pPIN2::PIN2-GFP constructs
were introduced into mTCP3 plants. In comparison to wild-
type roots (Figure S4a), PIN1 showed an overall decreased
abundance but an unaltered localization pattern in mTCP3
roots (Figure S4b). By contrast, the PIN2 localization and
abundance in mTCP3 roots (Figure S4d) was similar to that
observed in wild-type roots (Figure S4c). These observa-
tions are consistent with a previous report showing that
PIN1 localization and abundance were ﬂavonol-sensitive
but PIN2 localization and abundance were not (Peer et al.,
2004). The reduced abundance of PIN1 therefore probably
accounts for reduced auxin transport capacity observed in
mTCP3 plants.

Identiﬁcation of differentially expressed genes in mTCP3
and TCP3SRDX plants

Microarray experiments were performed using ATH1 Gene-
Chips, and transcriptome comparison between wild-type,
mTCP3 and TCP3SRDX seedlings revealed a large number

of de-regulated genes that were grouped into 11 functional
categories (308 and 75 genes for mTCP3 plants and 126
and 208 genes for TCP3SRDX plants were up- and down-
respectively; Figure S5a–d). Expression of
regulated,
mTCP3 affected transcription of genes in the categories
‘ﬂavonoid biosynthesis’ (3% up-regulated; Figure S5a) and
‘auxin signaling’ (9% down-regulated; Figure S5b). In con-
trast, among the up-regulated genes in TCP3SRDX plants,
no ﬂavonoid biosynthesis-related genes were identiﬁed,
but 2% belong to the category ‘auxin signaling’ (Figure
S5c). Among the down-regulated genes in TCP3SRDX
plants, no auxin signaling-related genes were detected, but
2% of the genes fall into the category ‘ﬂavonoid biosynthe-
sis’ (Figure S5d). To explore potential TCP3 target genes
that contribute to observed alterations of ﬂavonoid accu-
mulation and auxin response, further analysis focused on
candidate genes that were associated with ﬂavonoid
metabolism and auxin signaling. Nineteen genes showing
a more than twofold expression change (P < 0.05) between
wild-type and mTCP3 seedlings were identiﬁed (Table 1).
Ten genes involved in the ﬂavonoid biosynthetic pathway
were up-regulated 3.27-
to 24.35-fold in mTCP3 plants
(Table 1). These include the regulatory R2R3-MYB gene
PAP1 and structural genes encoding key ﬂavonoid biosyn-
thetic enzymes, such as 4CL, CHS/TT4, F3H/TT6, DFR/TT3
and LDOX/TT18. The late ﬂavonoid genes DFR/TT3 and
LDOX/TT18 participate in anthocyanin biosynthesis and

with the strong anthocyanin accumulation observed in
mTCP3 seedlings.
In TCP3SRDX seedlings, these genes
were either unaffected or were affected in the opposite
direction, showing a 1.24- to 4.90-fold down-regulation
(Table 1). A 2.07-
to 8.62-fold down-regulation was
observed for auxin signaling-related genes in mTCP3
plants. These genes encode proteins that participate in
polar auxin transport (AUX1, ATP-binding cassette trans-
porter 1/PGP1 and ATP-binding cassette transporter 19/
PGP19) or encode the indole-3-acetic acid amido synthase
(GH3.17), the auxin receptor (TIR1) or the auxin-inducible
transcription factor (AUX/IAA29) (Table 1). Genes that neg-
atively affect the auxin response, such as CYP83B1/SUR2,
which encodes a negative regulator of auxin production
(Bak et al., 2001), and the auxin-responsive gene SAUR
(At2 g46690), which possibly encodes a negative regulator
of auxin synthesis and transport (Kant et al., 2009), were
up-regulated 3.27- and 2.05-fold, respectively (Table 1).
Enhanced expression was observed for auxin-related
genes in TCP3SRDX plants, such as AUX/IAA29 (3.24-fold)
and PAR1 (3.14-fold), that encodes a transcriptional repres-
sor of
the indole-3-acetic acid-responsive genes and
SAUR68. The transcriptome data thus imply that TCP3 reg-
ulates ﬂavonoid biosynthesis positively and modulates the
auxin response negatively.

The consensus sequence GT/CGGNCCC has been deter-
mined to be a DNA binding site for class II TCP proteins,
with no more than two mismatches allowed for successful
recognition (Kosugi and Ohashi, 2002; Schommer et al.,
2008). The distribution of this consensus site was exam-
ined in the regions extending 1000 bp upstream of the

respective genes as well as in their introns. None of the 19
de-regulated genes was found to possess such a binding
motif with fewer than three mismatches. Therefore, TCP3
proteins may regulate transcription of these genes by par-
ticipation in a transcription factor complex in which TCP3
itself does not bind to a class II consensus recognition site.

Identiﬁcation of proteins interacting with TCP3

Expression of the early ﬂavonoid biosynthetic genes is
controlled by the three closely related R2R3-MYBs: MYB11,
MYB12 and MYB111 (Stracke et al., 2007). For transcrip-
tional activation of the late ﬂavonoid biosynthetic genes,
the R2R3-MYB–bHLH–WD40 (MBW) complex is required
(Dubos et al., 2010). Some transcription factors, such as
miR156-targeted SPL9, the WIP-type zinc ﬁnger protein TT1
and the R3-MYB protein MYBL2, have been shown to par-
ticipate in the regulation of ﬂavonoid biosynthesis by asso-
ciating with R2R3-MYBs or bHLHs to alter the stability of
this ternary complex (Dubos et al., 2008; Appelhagen et al.,
2011; Gou et al., 2011). Based on these reports, we consid-
ered that TCP3 may also interact with these regulatory pro-
teins to participate in control of the ﬂavonoid biosynthetic
pathway. Yeast two-hybrid assays were performed using
TCP3 as bait fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (BD),
and key regulators of early ﬂavonoid biosynthetic genes
(MYB12 and MYB111) and late ﬂavonoid biosynthetic
genes (TT2, PAP1, PAP2, MYB113, MYB114, TT8, TTG1,
TT1 and MYBL2) as well as the trichome initiation regula-
tor GLABROUS1 (GL1) as prey fused to the GAL4 activation
domain (AD) (Figure 4a). Except for GL1, strong interac-
tions of TCP3 with all other analyzed R2R3-MYBs (MYB12,

MYB111, TT2, PAP1, PAP2, MYB113 and MYB114) were
observed. However, TCP3 did not interact directly with the
bHLH protein TT8, the WD40 domain protein TTG1 or GL1
(Figure 4a). TCP3 was also found to form a heterodimer
with the smaller R3-MYB protein MYBL2 but not with TT1
(Figure 4a).

To further investigate TCP3 interactions with key regula-
tory proteins of the ﬂavonoid pathway in planta, bimolecu-
lar ﬂuorescence complementation (BiFC) assays were
performed. The N-terminus of YFP (YN) was cloned
upstream of TCP3, and the C-terminus of YFP (YC) was N-
terminally fused to TT8, TTG1 and each of the six tested
R2R3-MYBs (TT2, PAP1, PAP2, MYB113, MYB114 and GL1).

for co-expression of TCP3 with TT2, PAP1, PAP2, MYB113
and MYB114, but not with GL1, TT8 and TTG1 (Figure 4c–g
and Figure S6), demonstrating that TCP3 binds to ﬂavonoid
R2R3-MYBs in the nucleus in planta and may thus affect
transcriptional processes. As negative controls, co-expres-
sion of non-fused YN with non-fused YC or one of the
fusion proteins with non-fused YN or non-fused YC failed
to reconstitute a ﬂuorescent YFP chromophore (Figure 4b).

activated TCP3

2011). To examine whether TCP3 is able to strengthen TT8
interactions with R2R3-MYBs, yeast three-hybrid assays
were performed to compare interaction strengths of the
tested proteins by monitoring reporter expression using
b-galactosidase assays. In addition to containing a site for
integrating TT8 as a bait, the yeast three-hybrid vector
pBRIDGE also possesses a second site for conditional
expression of TCP3. Transcription of TCP3 was repressed
in the presence of 1 mM methionine (TCP3–), whereas the

PAP2 were individually fused to the activation domain
(AD-TT2, AD-PAP1 and AD-PAP2), and the pBRIDGE vector
with only the TT8 integration was used as a control (BD-
TT8). Consistent with previous reports (Zimmermann
et al., 2004), protein interactions between each of the three
R2R3-MYBs and TT8 were observed for each of the three
control experiments lacking TCP3 expression, with interac-
tion strengths varying from 54.45 to 69.23 Miller units
(Figure 4h). However, co-expression of TCP3 with TT8 and
each of the three tested R2R3-MYB genes led to signiﬁ-
cantly enhanced reporter activity (93.62–107.51 Miller
units; Figure 4h), suggesting that TCP3 inﬂuences the sta-
bility of the MBW complex and thereby enhances its tran-
scriptional activation activity.

Phenotypic analysis of tt4-11 mutants expressing mTCP3
and TCP3SRDX

tt4-11 null mutant plants fail to produce any class of ﬂavo-
noids, as CHS, which is encoded by TT4, catalyzes the ﬁrst
step of the ﬂavonoid pathway (Shirley et al., 1995; Buer
et al., 2006). To test whether the observed morphological
abnormalities in mTCP3 and TCP3SRDX plants were
caused by altered ﬂavonoid biosynthesis, mTCP3/tt4-11
and TCP3SRDX/tt4-11 plants were generated.

Both young and adult tt4-11 mutant plants (Figure 5a
and Figure S7d,j) looked very similar to wild-type plants
(Figure 2a and Figure S7a,g), except that adult tt4-11 plants
exhibited slightly reduced plant height (Figure S7g versus
Figure S7j), as also observed for the tt4-1 null mutant (Buer
and Djordjevic, 2009). As expected, no ﬂavonoid accumula-
tion was observed for seedlings and seeds of
tt4-11
mutants (Figure 5a,d), with the tt4-11 seeds being yellow
in color (Figure 5d) and similar in size to wild-type seeds
(Figure 1j versus Figure 5d). The tt4-11 cotyledons devel-
oped a vascular pattern (Figure 5g) similar to that seen in
wild-type cotyledons (Figure 1d). mTCP3/tt4-11 plants
resembled the tt4-11 mutant (Figure 5b,e,h and Figures
S7e,k and S8e–h), and auxin-related defects, such as
altered phyllotaxy, abnormal leaf vasculature and a bushy
appearance caused by reduced apical dominance, were not
observed. These results imply that TCP3 regulates the
auxin response by positively modulating ﬂavonoid biosyn-
thesis. Expression of TCP3SRDX in the tt4-11 mutant

DISCUSSION

TCP3 interacts with R2R3-MYB proteins and promotes
ﬂavonoid biosynthesis

TCP proteins participate in the control of a large variety of
developmental processes, such as ﬂoral symmetry (Luo
et al., 1996), plant architecture (Kiefer et al., 2011), mor-
phogenesis of lateral organs (Nath et al., 2003; Koyama
et al., 2007; Nag et al., 2009; Sarvepalli and Nath, 2011;
Danisman et al., 2012), leaf senescence (Schommer et al.,
2008; Sarvepalli and Nath, 2011), seed germination (Tate-
matsu et al., 2008), pollen development
(Takeda et al.,
2006), ﬂoral transition in axillary meristems (Niwa et al.,
2013), the circadian clock (Pruneda-Paz et al., 2009; Giraud
et al., 2010) and defense responses (Sugio et al., 2011).
Furthermore, TCPs are also involved in the biosynthesis of

plant hormones, such as brassinosteroids and jasmonic
acid (Schommer et al., 2008; Sugio et al., 2011).

Here, a combination of microarray data, protein interac-
tion experiments and genetic interaction analysis together
with determination of altered ﬂavonoid levels in transgenic
plants indicates a regulatory function for TCP3 in the ﬂavo-
noid biosynthetic pathway. The production of ﬂavonols,
anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins shares the last com-
mon precursor dihydroﬂavonol, which is further oxidized
by FLS to generate ﬂavonols or reduced by DFR to ulti-
mately synthesize anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins
(Figure S1). Expression of miRJAW-resistant mTCP3 stimu-
lated ﬂavonoid biosynthesis, leading to hyper-accumula-
tion of all three end-products. Proanthocyanidin hyper-
production was observed not only in the endothelium of
mTCP3 seeds but also occurred in the other four layers of
the seed coat. Similar deposition proﬁles of proanthocyani-
dins were also found in transgenic plants over-expressing
ARABIDOPSIS BSISTER (ABS)/TT16, which encodes the
ARABIDOPSIS BSISTER MADS domain protein and is nec-
essary for BANYULS expression and proanthocyanidin
accumulation in the endothelium of the seed coat. with the
exception of
the chalazal/micropylar area (Nesi et al.,
2002). Ecotopic accumulation of proanthocyanidins in
mTCP3 seed coats implies that expression of mTCP3
induces the biosynthesis and accumulation of proanthocy-
anidins in the whole testa. In agreement with enhanced ﬂa-
vonoid production in mTCP3 plants, microarray data
showed that expression of mTCP3 activated many enzy-
matic and regulatory genes involved in the early (4CL,
CHS/TT4 and F3H/TT6) and late steps (DFR/TT3, LDOX/
TT18, PAP1) of the ﬂavonoid biosynthetic pathway. Consis-
tently, transcriptome analysis detected down-regulation of
these genes in TCP3SRDX plants, albeit to a lower extent
compared with their up-regulation in mTCP3 plants, which
may account
for slightly decreased ﬂavonoid levels in
TCP3SRDX plants. Collectively, ﬂavonoid phenotypes and
transcriptome data from combinatorial analysis of mTCP3
and TCP3SRDX plants strongly indicate a regulatory role
for TCP3 in ﬂavonoid biosynthesis.

R2R3-MYB proteins activate early ﬂavonoid biosynthetic
genes and also participate in formation of the MBW com-
plex to control expression of late ﬂavonoid biosynthetic
genes (Dubos et al., 2010). Several transcription factors
have been suggested to interfere with the formation or
integrity of the MBW complex by interacting with R2R3-
MYBs or bHLHs (Dubos et al., 2008; Appelhagen et al.,
2011; Gou et al., 2011). Yeast two-hybrid assays combined
with BiFC experiments revealed nuclear interactions of
TCP3 with the ﬂavonoid R2R3-MYBs TT2, PAP1, PAP2,
MYB113, MYB114, MYB12 and MYB111. The three closely
related R2R3-MYBs MYB11, MYB12 and MYB111 act redun-
dantly to activate expression of CHS/TT4, CHI/TT5, F3H/TT6
and FLS1 and thus regulate early steps of the ﬂavonoid

TCP3 regulates ﬂavonoid and auxin pathways 9

pathway (Stracke et al., 2007). Heterodimerization of TCP3
with MYB12 or MYB111 as detected here may contribute to
the up- and down-regulation of
the early biosynthetic
genes CHS/TT4 and F3H/TT6 observed in mTCP3 and
TCP3SRDX plants, respectively. Interactions of TCP3 with
the anthocyanin-speciﬁc regulators PAP1, PAP2, MYB113
and MYB114, as well as with the proanthocyanidin-speciﬁc
regulator TT2, imply a role for TCP3 in regulation of the
late biosynthetic genes. The two functionally equivalent
R2R3-MYBs GL1 and WEREWOLF (WER) form an MBW
complex with GL3/ENHANCER OF GLABRA3 (EGL3) and
TTG1 to control trichome initiation and specify the identity
of root-hairless cells, respectively (Ishida et al., 2007). Our
inability to detect interaction between TCP3 and GL1 is in
agreement with the lack of trichome phenotypes in trans-
genic plants, demonstrating the speciﬁcity of TCP3 interac-
tions with ﬂavonoid R2R3-MYBs. No direct interactions
between TCP3 with TT8 or TTG1 were detected. Further-
more, yeast three-hybrid experiments demonstrated that
TCP3 strengthened TT8 interactions with TT2, PAP1 and
PAP2. Given this observation, TCP3 may act in a manner
similar to the WIP-type zinc ﬁnger protein TT1 to stabilize
formation of the ternary MBW complex and thereby pro-
mote ﬂavonoid production. TT1 interacts with TT2 and
PAP1 but not with MYB12, TT8 or TTG1, and activates not
only late steps of the ﬂavonoid pathway in the seed coat
endothelium but also early steps leading to heightened
CHS expression (Appelhagen et al., 2011).
In addition,
over-expression of PAP genes stimulates expression of
early and late structural genes of the ﬂavonoid pathway
(Borevitz et al., 2000; Tohge et al., 2005). However, expres-
sion studies using GL3:glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and
TTG1:GR fusions revealed direct regulation of only the late
ﬂavonoid biosynthetic genes by the MBW complex (Gonz-
alez et al., 2008). Together, activation of early ﬂavonoid
biosynthetic genes by TT1 and PAPs implies indirect
involvement of anthocyanin- and proanthocyanidin-spe-
ciﬁc MBW complexes in the control of early steps of the
ﬂavonoid pathway. The positive feedback regulation of
TT8 expression by the MBW complex adds another layer
of complexity to the regulatory mechanism of ﬂavonoid
biosynthesis (Baudry et al., 2006). Microarray data revealed
a 13.08-fold up-regulation of PAP1 expression in mTCP3
plants, suggesting that TCP3 may regulate PAP1 expres-
sion by associating with R2R3-MYB proteins.

The miR156-targeted SPL9 and R3-MYB protein MYBL2
function as negative regulators of ﬂavonoid biosynthesis,
and have been shown to interact with R2R3-MYBs and
bHLHs, respectively (Dubos et al., 2008; Gou et al., 2011).
Molecular interactions between MYBL2 and bHLHs as well
as between SPL9 and R2R3-MYBs may competitively dis-
rupt
the R2R3-MYB/bHLH protein interaction and thus
counteract the regulatory activity of the MBW complex
(Dubos et al., 2008; Matsui et al., 2008; Gou et al., 2011).

10 Shutian Li and Sabine Zachgo

TCP3 was also found to form a heterodimer with MYBL2 in
yeast cells. Therefore, it is also possible that TCP3 pro-
motes formation of the MBW complex by interacting with
MYBL2 and thus releasing bHLHs.

TCP3 compromises the auxin response by enhancing
ﬂavonol production

Auxin regulates diverse developmental processes by alter-
ing the expression of a large number of genes, including
early auxin-responsive genes of the AUX/IAA, GH3 and
SAUR gene families (Petrasek and Friml, 2009). Transgenic
plants expressing mTCP3 showed altered leaf phyllotaxy,
abnormal vasculature patterning, reduced apical domi-
nance, and impaired root growth and development, as well
as reduced organ size. These morphological abnormalities
are reminiscent of auxin-deﬁcient or -insensitive mutants
(Leyser et al., 1993; Dharmasiri et al., 2005), suggesting
that TCP3 interferes with auxin signaling. Analysis of the
auxin-responsive reporter pDR5::GUS revealed that expres-
sion of mTCP3 signiﬁcantly reduced the auxin response.
This reduction and the phenotypic defects of mTCP3 plants
were not rescued by applying exogenous auxin. Further
analysis of auxin efﬂux carriers revealed a decreased abun-
dance of plasma membrane-localized PIN1 in mTCP3 roots.
Microarray analysis of mTCP3 seedlings identiﬁed many
auxin-related genes with altered expression levels, includ-
ing early auxin-responsive genes (GH3.17, AUX/IAA29 and
SAUR), auxin transporter protein genes (PGP19, PGP1 and
AUX1) and the auxin receptor gene TIR1. Collectively,
these results indicate that expression of mTCP3 weakens
the auxin response, probably by impairing the auxin trans-
port capacity. Although no signiﬁcant alterations were
found for TCP3SRDX seedlings in terms of
the auxin
response as monitored by the pDR5::GUS reporter, tran-
scriptome analysis did reveal enhanced expression of sev-
eral auxin-related genes, including AUX/IAA29, PAR1 and
PGP1. Recently, inducible expression of dominant-negative
TCP3SRDX led to up-regulation of PIN-FORMED1 (PIN1),
PIN5 and PIN6 as well as down-regulation of SAUR genes,
PIN3, PIN4 and PIN7, and AUX/IAA genes (Koyama et al.,
2010a). These de-regulated auxin-related genes were not
identiﬁed in this study, possibly due to the different experi-
mental conditions. Koyama et al. (2010a) generated micro-
array data from 10-day-old pXVE::TCP3SRDX seedlings
exposed to 5 lM estradiol for 24 h in liquid medium,
whereas 7-day-old soil-grown p35S::TCP3SRDX seedlings
were used in this study. Furthermore, no visible morpho-
logical abnormalities were observed for induced pXVE::
TCP3SRDX seedlings, while p35S::TCP3SRDX seedlings
showed phenotypic alterations, such as undulated leaves,
abnormal
cotyledon vasculature and improved root
growth.

Naturally occurring ﬂavonols such as quercetins and ka-
empferols have been established as negative regulators of

polar auxin efﬂux (Murphy et al., 2000; Peer et al., 2004;
Lazar and Goodman, 2006). Changing ﬂavonol levels by
applying exogenous ﬂavonols to activate or inactivate the
ﬂavonoid pathway has been shown to impair auxin trans-
port capacity and thus affects many auxin-related develop-
mental processes (Lazar and Goodman, 2006; Santelia
et al., 2008; Buer and Djordjevic, 2009). Expression of
mTCP3 in wild-type plants led to enhanced ﬂavonol levels
and auxin-related developmental defects. To unravel the
regulatory hierarchy of TCP3 for these two biological pro-
cesses, the null mutant tt4-11 (Shirley et al., 1995), which
does not produce any type of ﬂavonoids, was utilized. The
absence of ﬂavonoid production in mTCP3/tt4-11 plants
abrogated the auxin-related abnormalities observed in
mTCP3 plants. Given this observation, altered auxin
response in mTCP3 plants was probably caused by
enhanced ﬂavonol biosynthesis. Together,
these data
imply that TCP3 promotes ﬂavonol accumulation and thus
affects the auxin response.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Plant materials and growth conditions

Arabidopsis thaliana mutants and wild-type plants were grown
in soil or on half-strength Murashige & Skoog medium with
sucrose. Tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) and Arabidopsis plants
were grown in the greenhouse under controlled environmental
conditions.

Construction of transgenic plants

All cDNAs were isolated from a seedling-derived cDNA library.
miRJAW-resistant mTCP3 was engineered as described by Palat-
nik et al.
(2003). The dominant-negative TCP3SRDX and miR-
JAW-resistant mTCP3SRDX were created by fusing the SRDX
domain to the C-termini of TCP3 and mTCP3. TCP3, mTCP3 and
TCP3SRDX were introduced into the pBAR35S vector (Li et al.,
2009) for ectopic expression. A 7000 bp genomic fragment from
the TCP3 locus comprising 3557 bp upstream of the start codon
and 2290 bp downstream of the stop codon was cloned into the
pBAR-A vector (Li et al., 2009) to express the three TCP3 ver-
sions in their genomic context. To generate transgenic plants,
constructs were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens
strain GV3101 (pMP90RG). Arabidopsis plants harboring pDR5::
GUS were crossed with mTCP3 and TCP3SRDX plants. Clon-
ing primers used for generation of all constructs are listed in
Table S3.

Yeast two- and three-hybrid assays

For yeast-two hybrid assays, TCP3 was fused to the GAL4 DNA-
binding domain (GAL4-BD) in the vector pGBKT7 (Clontec, http://
www.clontech.com/). Full-length cDNAs for TT8, TTG1, TT1,
MYBL2 and all the tested R2R3-MYB genes were cloned to the
GAL4 activation domain (GAL4-AD) in the vector pGADT7 (Clon-
tech). After co-transformation using Y2HGold or mating using
Y187 and Y2HGold (Clontech), yeast cells were plated on selection
medium (SD/-Trp-His-Leu-Ade-aureobasidin, Clontech) and incu-
bated at 30°C for 3 days. For ternary complex analysis, TT8 and
TCP3 were cloned into the MCS I and MCS II sites of the yeast
three-hybrid vector pBRIDGE (Clontech),
respectively. One

construct with TT8 integrated into the MCS I site was used as a
control. Expression of TCP3 was repressed in the presence of
1 mM methionine and activated in the absence of methionine.
TT2, PAP1 and PAP2 were integrated into the pGADT7 vector.
After co-transformation, yeast cells were plated on selection med-
ium (SD/-Trp-His-Leu-Ade-aureobasidin or SD/-Trp-His-Met-Leu-
Ade-aureobasidin; Clontech) and incubated at 30°C for 3 days.
Quantiﬁcation of the b-galactosidase activity was performed as
described by Li et al. (2011).

BiFC experiments

Gateway-compatible vectors (pE-SPYNE and pE-SPYCE; Walter
et al., 2004) were used to generate expression vectors using a Gate-
way cloning strategy. The N-terminus of YFP (YN) was cloned
upstream of TCP3 in the pE-SPYNE vector, and the C-terminus of
YFP (YC) was fused upstream of TT2, PAP1, PAP2, MYB113,
MYB114, GL1, TT8 and TTG1 in the pE-SPYCE vector. Confocal
laser scanning microscopy was performed as described by Li et al.
(2009).

GUS enzymatic activity, GUS staining and vascular
patterning

GUS enzymatic activity and GUS staining were performed as
described by Yin et al. (2007). Vascular patterning was character-
ized as described by Carland et al. (1999). Representative images
were obtained using a Leica M165 FC ﬂuorescent stereomicro-
scope (http://www.leica-camera.de/).

Staining of ﬂavonols and proanthocyanidins

Six-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings were stained for 20 min using
saturated (0.25% w/v) diphenylboric acid-2-aminoethyl ester
(DPBA, http://www.roth-gmbh.de/) with 0.005% Triton X-100. Ara-
bidopsis immature siliques were incubated in 1% w/v vanillin (4–
hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde) in 6 M HCl for 40 min at 25°C.
Representative images were obtained using a Leica DM5000B
ﬂuorescent microscope.

Quantiﬁcation of anthocyanins and ﬂavonols

Anthocyanins were quantiﬁed as described by Gou et al. (2011).
Flavonol levels were measured as described by Lewis et al. (2011).
Focal planes of maximal DPBA ﬂuorescence intensity for the
cotyledonary node, hypocotyl/root transition zone and root tip of
each seedling were imaged at identical gain and laser intensity
using the ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate ﬁlter (excitation 490 nm and
emission 525 nm; Leica DM5000B ﬂuorescence microscope).
Fluorescence intensity was
recorded using ImageJ (http://
www.rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/), and the sum of the mean ﬂuorescence
intensity for the three analyzed ﬂavonol-accumulating regions rep-
resents the ﬂavonol
level for each seedling. Fluorescence data
were normalized and represented as fold changes over wild-type
plants.

Microarray assays

Three biological samples of total RNA were prepared from 7-day-
old wild-type and transgenic seedlings expressing mTCP3 and
TCP3SRDX. Probe preparation, hybridization to Arabidopsis
Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChips (http://www.affymetrix.com/) and sta-
tistical data analysis were performed at the Integrated Functional
Genomic Service Unit (University of M€unster, Germany). Candi-
date genes showing a more than twofold change (down or up,
P < 0.05) were considered as de-regulated genes. Classiﬁcation of

TCP3 regulates ﬂavonoid and auxin pathways 11

de-regulated genes was performed based on functional annota-
tion of each locus (Arabidopsis Information Resource, http://
www.arabidopsis.org/).
