Abstract 

 

 
At the end of 1980s, the question  of « quartiers sensibles » (at-risk neighborhoods) started 
to be very publicized in France. It was not  only the subject of many front-page articles, but also 
the target of a new public policy aimed at promoting urban and social development in about 500 
neighborhoods (Politique de la ville). I argue that such a focus on « quartiers sensibles » does not on-
ly result from increasing problems such as unemployment, poverty or juvenile delinquency ; it al-
so  represents  a  major  change  in  public  policy.  Focusing  on  « quartiers  sensibles »  directly  con-
tributed to the restructuring of the French welfare state by centering its action on specific urban 
spaces rather than national territory, and on social links rather than economic reality, contrary to 
what the welfate state claimed to do during the Fordist period. The outbreak of riots in Novem-
ber 2005 is inextricably bound up with the way some problems (like lack of communication and 
weakening  social links) have been associated  with  the question of « quartiers sensibles »  whereas 
the French model of integration, based on equality among abstract citizens, left some others (like 
ethnic discrimination) unquestioned.
