transparency. a, In conventional EIT in an
atomic system, a strong pump field ȣp is tuned to
an atomic energy transition (1–2) and creates a
‘transparency window’ for the signal field ȣs,
which is tuned to a second transition (1–3). 
b, Destructive interference between the two
absorption pathways results in a narrow spike of
increased transmission within a wider absorption
line. The refractive index of the material thus
varies rapidly over a narrow frequency range, and
the resulting increased dispersion can lead to
ultraslow propagation of light. The narrow spike
also provides a well-defined frequency marker
for precision measurements. c, In a system of
microresonators, studied by Xu et al.1, EIT occurs
because of destructive interference between two
fields, leaving two appropriately spaced rings in
the direction of the reflection port. The width of
the absorption feature is determined by the
overall loss of the ring resonator system (often
dominated by coupling to the straight
waveguide), whereas that of the transparency
window is set by the internal loss of the ring
resonators. (Part c adapted from ref. 1.)

whenever a whole number of wavelengths of
the incident light fits into the resonator. More-
over, destructive interference occurs between
light emerging from two coupled resonators. 
Early microresonators were simply aerosols
containing particles of varying sizes, but mod-
ern fabrication procedures produce individual
resonators with highly controllable resonance
frequencies4. These resonators come in various
forms: ring shapes; disks or spheres, in which
the light skims across the outer surface as sound
does in a ‘whispering gallery’; or less obvious
forms, such as defects in an otherwise perfect
photonic crystal. Their small size makes them
ideally suited to perform operations on light
analogous to those performed by components
702

of silicon chips on electrons, and numerous
applications have been proposed for them5–7.

Several methods5,8,9 for combining EIT and
optical  microresonators  to  obtain  EIT-like 
resonances in integrated optical systems were
proposed in 2004, and a laboratory demon-
stration of such an effect was published last
year10. In that experiment, EIT-like transmis-
sion spectra were observed in two interacting
microresonators in the form of glass spheres
approximately 400 micrometres in diameter
that supported resonances of the whispering-
gallery type. 

Xu et al.1 take this advance a stage further.
Using modern nanofabrication procedures,
they manufactured a pair of micro-ring res-
onators coupled to parallel waveguides on a
silicon-on-insulator  substrate  typical  of  an
electronic chip. The refractive index of the 
silicon that made up the waveguides and the
rings (3.45) was significantly greater than that
of the silicon oxide that surrounded them on
all sides (1.46). This meant that light could be
confined  in  rings  of  a  very  small  diameter
through the process known as total internal
reflection.  EIT-like  behaviour  was  demon-
strated by measuring the transmission at dif-
ferent frequencies of a laser beam injected into
the system. The authors constructed several
such devices, where the distance between the
micro-rings was varied from device to device,
and thus the spectral location of the EIT-like
transmission peak could be adjusted. 

So what good is all this? As the name indi-
cates,  EIT  is  primarily  a  way  of  rendering
transparent  an  otherwise  highly  absorbing
material, and so lends itself to applications
such  as  the  construction  of  long-distance 
optical  transmission  lines. The  dispersion
characteristic that results from EIT has already
allowed 
light’  propagation  to  be
achieved11–13 at speeds just a small fraction 
of the normal speed of light. Optical ‘buffers’
to  temporarily  store  light are  an  obvious 

‘slow 

application of such slow-light technology.

Perhaps most importantly, EIT resonances
can  be  much  narrower  than  those  of  indi-
vidual resonators, whether these are atoms or
microresonators. As a resonance frequency
can typically be measured only to an accuracy
given by some fixed fraction of the resonance
linewidth, narrowed linewidths could be use-
ful for performing precise optical measure-
ments  of  quantities  such  as  magnetic  field
strength14. The ability to synthesize such com-
ponents on an optical chip suggested by Xu
and colleagues’ innovation1 is a crucial step
towards the development of such integrated
optical devices.

NEUROBIOLOGY 

Extending influence

Eve Marder
Rather than merely firing in a digital on–off fashion, vertebrate neurons 
may have an analogue aspect to their signalling too — a finding that will not
surprise many who have worked on invertebrate neurons.

Much of what we know about electrical sig-
nalling in the brain comes from extracellular
recordings that detect when a neuron is firing
action  potentials.  These  recordings  do  not,
however, provide continuous monitoring of
the fluctuations of membrane potential, and 
do  not  capture  sub-threshold  changes  in 
membrane potential such as those caused by
individual synaptic events. The prevalence of

extracellular recordings in the literature has
contributed to a collective consciousness in
which the action potential or ‘spike’ is viewed
as  an  invariant,  all-or-nothing  stereotyped
event that occurs once a threshold membrane
potential is reached. This ‘digital’ signal carries
information from the neuronal cell body, the
soma, down the axon to presynaptic terminals,
where it evokes the release of neurotransmitter

to excite or inhibit the next neuron. In this sim-
ple  framework,  the  spike  frequency  might
influence the amount of transmitter release by
mechanisms such as facilitation and depres-
sion1, but sub-threshold events occurring in
the soma and the dendrites (the projections
that receive inputs from other neurons) are
thought to be too far away to influence trans-
mitter release from the axonal terminals. 

Alle and Geiger writing in Science2, and Shu
et al. (this issue, page 761)3 now show, how-
ever, that the release of neurotransmitter from
axon terminals of certain vertebrate neurons is
influenced by the somatic membrane poten-
tial. So, in terms of neuronal signalling, the
axon terminals and the soma are electrically
much closer than many would have assumed
(Fig. 1). The salient finding in both papers,
from which all of the rest of the results follow,
is that the length constant, ȕ, of axons is sur-
prisingly long, at about 420–450 Ȗm, in two
types of neuron: hippocampal mossy fibres
from rats2 and layer 5 pyramidal cells from the
prefrontal cortex of ferrets3. ȕ is the distance
over which a voltage change imposed at one
site  will  drop  to  approximately  37%  of  its 
initial  value4.  Although  rapid  changes  in 
membrane potential are more attenuated by
distance  than  are  slow  signals, when  two
regions of a neuron are less than ȕ apart, they
are commonly considered to be electrically
‘close’. Put another way, at a distance less than
ȕ, changes in membrane potential at one place
will appreciably alter the membrane potential
at the other. In the case of the mossy fibres, ȕ
was  calculated  using  the  distance  between
recordings made from boutons (presumably
presynaptic release sites) and the soma2. In the
case of the prefrontal cortical neurons, simul-
taneous recordings were made from the soma
and axon at known distances apart3. 

How surprising is it that ȕ is so long in these
neurons? Some readers will undoubtedly be
taken aback to discover that vertebrate neurons
can be so electrically compact, at least for slow
signals. But those of us who work with large
neurons in invertebrates already know of cases
in which somatic voltages influence the axon
more than a millimetre away5. In the vertebrate
hippocampal2 and layer 5 cortical neurons3 the
consequence of ȕ being so long is that slow
depolarizations  (positive-going  changes  in
membrane  potential  that  bring  the  neuron
closer to threshold) of the membrane at the
somatic and dendritic regions are transmitted
to the axon terminals, and can influence the
release of transmitter. 

Shu et al.3 show that depolarization of the
soma can increase the amount of spike-medi-
ated release of neurotransmitter from the pre-
synaptic terminals by about 30% per 10 mV of
somatic depolarization. Is this change likely to
be important for the function of the circuits
containing these neurons? This will depend on
many factors, but it is fair to say that even small
changes in synaptic strength can have signifi-
cant influences on circuit performance.

Figure 1 | Analogue signalling. The membrane
potential of the soma can influence transmitter
release from the axonal terminals2,3. a, An input
(green) produces a subthreshold depolarization
of the neuron (pink). This depolarization spreads
down the axon, decaying exponentially with
distance. At distance ȕ, a voltage change in the
soma will drop to 37% of its initial value. b, An
action potential (red) is triggered from a baseline
membrane potential of ǁ62 mV. The active
neuron releases neurotransmitter onto its
follower neuron, resulting in a postsynaptic
change (pale blue). c, The baseline somatic
potential is depolarized to ǁ48 mV, by barrages
of input synapses or by an electrode. Now, when
an action potential is evoked on the top of the
baseline depolarization, the action potential
(dark red) may be broader and results in a larger
amplitude synaptic event in the follower neuron
(dark blue).

In the work by Shu et al.3 somatic depolar-
ization was associated with significant spike
broadening, that is the return to resting poten-
tial occurred more slowly, in both the soma
and the axon. Presumably this spike broaden-
ing may contribute to the enhanced transmit-
ter  release,  as  occurs  elsewhere6,7.  In  this
study3, the authors recorded ongoing barrages
of synaptic potentials resulting from sponta-
neous network activity. The depolarizations
associated with these synaptic barrages were
seen in both somatic and axonal recordings,
demonstrating that signals of the amplitude
and time-course of normal synaptic inputs
could influence axonal membrane potential. 
Alle and Geiger2 saw no evidence of spike
broadening in their recordings. But they did
show that somatic depolarizations that mimic

those recorded in vivo during theta oscillations
(an ongoing brain rhythm) can substantially
increase the amplitudes of the postsynaptic
currents evoked by action potentials.

Many types of invertebrate neuron release
neurotransmitter both in response to action
potentials and as a graded function of mem-
brane  potential8–11.  There  is,  however,  an
important difference between the results in the
two studies highlighted here2,3 and the classic
graded transmission well characterized in the
retina and in many invertebrate neurons12–16.
In classic graded transmission, action poten-
tials are not necessary for transmitter release
because the threshold for transmitter release is
often close to the resting potential. Therefore,
synaptic release follows the analogue fluctua-
tions of the presynaptic neuron’s membrane
potential. In contrast, the results of Alle and
Geiger2 and of Shu et al.3 show no indication
that transmitter release occurs independently
of action potentials, but only that the somatic
membrane potential can influence how much
transmitter is released by an action potential.
Over the years, I have watched the charac-
teristics ascribed to vertebrate neurons slowly
evolve  to  exhibit  many  of  the  attributes  so
clearly demonstrable in invertebrate neurons.
I now find it gratifying that vertebrate neurons
found in the hippocampus and cortex, brain
regions well known for their importance in
memory and cognition, may also avail them-
selves of some of the benefits of analogue pro-
cessing in addition to spike-mediated release.
My  guess  is  that  this  work2,3 will  trigger
numerous studies to determine how transmit-
ter release from spiking neurons in the verte-
brate brain is influenced by slow changes in
membrane potential that result from neuro-
modulation and ongoing activity. In this way,
we will come to understand how neural cir-
cuits produce variable outputs as a function of
behavioural state and mood.
