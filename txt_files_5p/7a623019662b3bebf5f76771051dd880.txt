Common mistakes

When constructing a CNF from a truth table, you have to consider
the ”N” rows

Don’t do too many steps at once when constructing a truth table -
it’s easy to make a mistake

It’s hard to check whether a DNF/CNF is optimal - practice makes
perfect

Deﬁnitions

Deﬁnition
A syntactic proof procedure for a formal language L is called a calculus
for L. There are two types of calculi, but we will focus on the latter:

Axiomatic calculi

Rule calculi

Deﬁnition
A rule calculus C for L provides a set of derivation rules for transforming
wﬀs of L by manipulating sequences of symbols without referring to their
truth-conditions.

Deﬁnitions

Deﬁnition
A derivation of Ψ from Φ1, Φ2, ..., Φn in a rule calculus C is a chain of
wﬀs whose initial links are the wﬀs Φ1 to Φn and whose ﬁnal link is Ψ,
such that all transitions from one formula to the next result from applying
one of the derivation rules of C.

Deﬁnition
A wﬀ Ψ is syntactically derivable from wﬀs Φ1, Φ2, ..., Φn in a rule
calculus C iﬀ Ψ is listed in the last line of a derivation scheme that accords
with the rules of C, such that the assumption list (ﬁrst column) of the last
line only refers to the line numbers featuring the formulas Φ1 to Φn.

Deﬁnitions

Deﬁnition
A wﬀ Ψ (conclusion) is syntactically proven to follow from a set of wﬀs
Φ1, Φ2, ..., Φn (premises) by means of a rule calculus C iﬀ Ψ it is
syntactically derivable from Φ1, Φ2, ..., Φn using only the derivation rules of
C.

Deﬁnitions

Deﬁnition
A calculus C is sound iﬀ, whenever a sentence Ψ is syntactically derivable
in C from the sentences Φ1, Φ2, ..., Φn (in symbols: Φ1, Φ2, ..., Φn (cid:96)C Ψ),
then Ψ is semantically entailed by Φ1, Φ2, ..., Φn (in symbols:
Φ1, Φ2, ..., Φn (cid:15) Ψ).

Deﬁnition
A calculus C is complete iﬀ, whenever a set of premises {Φ1, Φ2, ..., Φn}
semantically entails a conclusion Ψ (in symbols: Φ1, Φ2, ..., Φn (cid:15) Ψ), then
Ψ is syntactically derivable in C from Φ1, Φ2, ..., Φn (in symbols:
Φ1, Φ2, ..., Φn (cid:96)C Ψ).

Examples for sound/unsound, complete/incomplete calculi (Keep these in
mind!)

Consider the calculus with only one rule: You can always introduce
the tautology p → p

Consider the calculus with only one rule: You can always introduce
the tautology p → p
This calculus is sound (you can only derive true sentences) but not
complete (you can’t derive any other of the true statements)

Consider the calculus with only one rule: You can introduce every wﬀ
of the given language.

This calculus is complete (if you want to derive a true sentence you
just introduce it) but not sound (you can always introduce ¬p ∧ p)
We want to ﬁnd a calculus that hits the right balance - one that is both,
complete and sound.

Rules of GLCS

Method
GLCS has exactly 13 derivation rules:
Assumption Introduction A (cid:96) A
Conjunction Introduction / Elimination

A, B (cid:96) A ∧ B
A ∧ B (cid:96) A

Disjunction Introduction / Elimination

A (cid:96) A ∨ B
A ∨ B, Γ, ∆, (A, Γ (cid:96) C ), (B, ∆ (cid:96) C ) (cid:96) C

Conditional Proof Γ, (A, Γ (cid:96) B) (cid:96) A → B
Modus Ponendo Ponens A, A → B (cid:96) B
Modus Tollendo Tollens ¬B, A → B (cid:96) ¬A
Reduction ad Absurdum Γ, (A, Γ (cid:96) B ∧ ¬B) (cid:96) ¬A
Biconditional Introduction / Elimination A ↔ B (cid:97)(cid:96) (A → B) ∧ (B → A)
Double negation Introduction / Elimination ¬¬A (cid:97)(cid:96) A

If the sentence to be derived is a conjunction, derive both of its
conjuncts separately, and then apply Conjunction Introduction.

Keep in mind:

Read the exercise carefully!

This type of exercise is going to be important in future lectures -
spend suﬃcient time on the homework

apart from the heuristics mentioned above there really aren’t any
perfect rules to do a derivation - practice makes perfect
