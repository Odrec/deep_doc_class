Divergence of fMRI and neural signals in V1 during
perceptual suppression in the awake monkey

Alexander Maier1, Melanie Wilke1, Christopher Aura1, Charles Zhu2, Frank Q Ye2 & David A Leopold1,2

The role of primary visual cortex (V1) in determining the contents of perception is controversial. Human functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of perceptual suppression have revealed a robust drop in V1 activity when a stimulus is
subjectively invisible. In contrast, monkey single-unit recordings have failed to demonstrate such perception-locked changes in
V1. To investigate the basis of this discrepancy, we measured both the blood oxygen level–dependent (BOLD) response and
several electrophysiological signals in two behaving monkeys. We found that all signals were in good agreement during
conventional stimulus presentation, showing strong visual modulation to presentation and removal of a stimulus. During
perceptual suppression, however, only the BOLD response and the low-frequency local ﬁeld potential (LFP) power showed
decreases, whereas the spiking and high-frequency LFP power were unaffected. These results demonstrate that the coupling
between the BOLD and electrophysiological signals in V1 is context dependent, with a marked dissociation occurring during
perceptual suppression.

Perceptual suppression provides an intriguing puzzle for sensory
neuroscientists: how is an unperceived stimulus represented in the
brain? Binocular rivalry and related phenomena, in which salient visual
patterns are rendered temporarily invisible to the observer, have been
frequently employed to dissociate sensation from perception while
monitoring brain activity1. These studies have provided insight into
the nature of visual suppression, but have nonetheless failed to answer
the fundamental question of what role V1 activity has in determining
the visibility of a stimulus2. The main problem is that human and
animal studies have reached nearly opposite conclusions. On the one
hand, measurements of the BOLD signal
in human fMRI have
commonly found partial or even complete elimination of V1 responses
to perceptually suppressed stimuli during rivalry3–9, which suggests that
V1 is important in determining whether a stimulus reaches subsequent
processing stages. On the other hand, monkey single-unit studies found
little or no change in activity in this area as a function of perceptual
state, leading to the conclusion that perceptual suppression does not
involve the perturbation of visual signals in the ﬁrst cortical processing
stage10–13. This discrepancy has been identiﬁed as a major impediment
for understanding how V1 activity contributes to perception.

Until now, it has been impossible to isolate the potential reasons for
the observed differences, as fMRI and electrophysiological studies
have differed in their visual stimuli, behavioral procedures and
species tested3,14,15. Here, we directly investigated the basis of these
contradictory ﬁndings and further explored the role of V1 in
visual perception by measuring both fMRI and electrophysiological
responses of two trained monkeys experiencing perceptual suppression.
Holding the stimulus procedure constant, we found that fMRI and

neurophysiological signals in V1, although in good agreement during
conventional stimulation, consistently diverged during perceptual
suppression, with the most accurate reﬂection of stimulus visibility
provided by BOLD responses.

RESULTS
The main objective of the study was to compare neural and fMRI
responses under identical stimulus and perceptual conditions. To this
end, we trained both monkeys to respond explicitly to the visibility of a
salient target that was presented on a screen by depressing a lever when-
ever the target was present. We used generalized ﬂash suppression
(GFS)16, where a salient target disappears on the abrupt onset of a
surrounding ﬁeld of dynamic dots, to reliably induce perceptual
suppression (the stimulus sequence used in the present study is
shown in Fig. 1a). Previous work in monkeys13 and humans16
demonstrated that such a stimulus reliably leads to all-or-none percep-
tual suppression in the absence of either local or interocular conﬂict. By
adjusting stimulus parameters, such as the density of the dots, the
minimum distance between the dots and the target, and the ocular
conﬁguration, we were able to affect the probability of the all-or-none
target disappearance (see Methods). Suppression in the GFS procedure
is related to that in motion-induced blindness17, but is controlled using
a temporal sequence resembling binocular rivalry ﬂash suppression18.
As with conventional binocular rivalry, GFS suppression is known to
diminish the visual responses of extrastriate cortical neurons, but has
little effect on V1 ﬁring rates10,11,19,20.

We used two general approaches to induce perceptual suppression.
In the ﬁrst, which we term perceptual report testing, we adjusted the

Figure 1 Generalized ﬂash suppression protocol for the block design
experiment. (a) Stimulus conditions. The parameters of the salient target and
the random dot surround were adjusted to create ﬁve different conditions,
with individual trials lasting 6 s (1-min blocks consisted of up to nine such
trials). In the generalized ﬂash suppression (INV) condition, the appearance
of surrounding dots to both eyes consistently induced the monocular target to
disappear (the time period during which the target stimulus disappears is
indicated with a thick orange line). In the physical removal (OFF) condition,
the target was physically extinguished on appearance of the dots, mimicking
perceptual suppression. In the temporal reversal (VISTR) and binocular (VIS)
conditions, the stimuli were adjusted by reversing the order of the target (red
disk) and surround (moving random dots) or by presenting the target to both
eyes, respectively, to ensure that the target did not disappear. Finally, in the
ﬁxation (FIX) condition (not depicted), the screen remained blank as the
monkey ﬁxated a small cross throughout the trial. (T on ¼ target on, T off ¼

stimulus parameters at the beginning of each session according to
the monkeys’ psychophysical report such that the probability of
disappearance for each trial presentation was roughly 0.5. This method,
which was applied in a previous study13, entails the sorting of neural
responses by the monkey’s report on a trial-by-trial basis. The second
approach, which allowed direct comparison of fMRI and electrophy-
siological responses, was termed block design testing (Fig. 1b). In block
design testing, which was used for the majority of the study, the
visibility of the target was controlled over extended periods (blocks)
by biasing the physical stimulus parameters (see Methods).

To isolate signal changes related to perceptual suppression, we
compared responses during conditions in which the target was ren-
dered either visible (VIS) or invisible (INV). Because of the existing
discrepancy in the literature, we were particularly interested in whether
activity during suppression (INV) would fall to the level of a control
condition in which the stimulus condition was turned off when
the surrounding dots appeared (OFF). This control condition is
perceptually indistinguishable from suppres-
sion16. For both fMRI and electrophysiologi-
cal testing, brain activation was measured
relative to a stimulus-free ﬁxation condition
(FIX). Note that
the monkeys were not
required to conﬁrm the disappearance during
the block design testing (maintaining accurate

perceptual report for truly ambiguous stimuli requires a large propor-
tion of interspersed catch trials). Nonetheless, the effectiveness of the
biased stimulus conﬁgurations was evaluated repeatedly in perceptual
report testing. The behavioral results in the two animals verify that the
manipulations of stimulus visibility were highly effective (see Fig. 1c)
and matched the expectations of observed psychophysical results in a
different group of monkeys13.

In the block design, stimuli were grouped into 30- or 60-s epochs of
repeated 6-s trials, during which the monkey was required to ﬁxate a
small cross. Blocks of the different conditions (INV, VIS, OFF, etc.)
were presented either sequentially or in randomly interleaved order
(Fig. 1b), with a total of four blocks of each type per scanning session.
After successfully completed trials, the animal received a drop of apple
juice and a short break (0.8–1.0s) in which it was free to brieﬂy move its
eyes about. Two animals participated in a total of 29 fMRI sessions and
41 electrophysiology sessions, which were conducted over the same
time period, but on different days.

each stimulus block). Note that the BOLD and
spiking activity drops in the OFF condition when
the target is physically removed inside, but not
outside, the target representation. The spiking
and fMRI signals are in close correspondence,
except for the GFS (INV) condition inside the

BOLD and spiking during perceptual suppression
We ﬁrst localized the retinotopic region of V1 corresponding to
the position of our recording chamber by functionally mapping the
BOLD response to solid red disks in different positions (see Methods
and Supplementary Fig. 1 online). After ﬁnding the correspondence to
the recording sites, we adopted this stimulus as a target for experi-
mental testing. Our experiments revealed that perceptual suppression
of the target (INV condition) strongly and consistently decreased
BOLD responses compared with the continually visible (VIS) condi-
tion. Population data from two monkeys revealed that activity in the
target responsive cortex dropped substantially during blocks of the
invisible trials, compared with blocks of visible trials, where the target
was continually perceived, even though the target was physically
present in both cases (Fig. 2). Activity during the invisible trials was
closest to the OFF control condition, where the target was physically
removed from the screen.

The block design made it necessary to implement two distinctly
different visible control conditions. Visibility was attained in one
condition by binocular presentation of the target (VIS), and in the
other by reversing the temporal order of the sequence (VISTR). The
binocular presentation of the target in the VIS condition explains the
slightly higher response than the one observed in the monocular VISTR
condition, consistent with previous work on binocular integration21.
Nonetheless, this difference is small compared with the effects of
perceptual suppression, where the target-responsive region showed
activity that more closely resembled the effects of physically removing
the stimulus. Note that in all cases, the target and surround stimuli were
on for the same period of time.

Perceptual suppression was consistently observed in single sessions
and in single voxels, and it was present when the order of the stimulus

blocks was sequential or randomly interleaved (Supplementary Fig. 2
online). These ﬁndings are consistent with a large number of human
fMRI studies showing that BOLD signals in V1 are a good measure of
perceptual visibility3–9.

We next compared BOLD and single unit modulation during
peceptual suppression (Fig. 3). We studied 172 well-isolated neurons
whose responses were signiﬁcantly modulated by the presentation of the
target (t tests, P o 0.05, out of 318 total neurons sampled, see Methods).
The monkey subjects, the stimulus and the block-design protocol were
identical to the fMRI testing. In sharp contrast to the modulation of the
BOLD signal, neurons in the target-responsive portion of cortex showed
no signiﬁcant change in their mean ﬁring during perceptual suppression
(P ¼ 0.98, t test; Fig. 3). Notably, the BOLD and spiking responses in V1,
tested in the same patch of cortex in the same monkey subjects,
speciﬁcally diverged during perceptual suppression, with the BOLD
signals, but not the spiking responses, following the percept. This result
serves to reconcile previous single-unit studies in monkeys10–13 with
fMRI studies in humans3–9 and demonstrates that neither the species
nor the stimulation protocol formed the basis of the discrepancy, which
instead arose from the nature of the measured signals themselves.

LFP modulation, perceptual suppression and the block design
We next explored whether modulation of the LFP signal might reﬂect
the BOLD signal more closely than the spiking and therein match the
monkey’s perceptual state22. Recent work using the perceptual report
procedure in GFS revealed that the power of lower-frequency LFP
components (o30 Hz) substantially decreased when the monkey
reported the disappearance of an ambiguous stimulus13. We thus
investigated whether LFP modulation was present in our data by ﬁrst
dividing the LFP into two frequency bands, low (5–30 Hz) and high

conditions, featuring activity changes in the
suppression period (following surround onset).
Each panel depicts the average spectrogram for
an entire trial period, with magnitude changes
relative to the 500-ms period preceding the
surround onset, in which the target alone was
present in each condition. Population data are
shown over all channels and over all recording
sessions (successfully completed trials only). All
relevant stimulus events are marked with dashed
lines (T ¼ target and S ¼ surround). Note that
although all of the conditions showed a drop in
low-frequency power following the surround onset,
the drop for the INV condition during the
suppression period was larger than the
corresponding drop for the VIS condition and
closely resembled physical removal (OFF).
(b) Statistical time-frequency analysis of
perceptual suppression versus physical removal
(for the time period indicated by a dashed square
in a). The upper plot (comparing the INV and VIS
conditions) shows a decrease during perceptual
suppression that was limited to the low frequencies, whereas the lower plot (comparing the OFF and VIS conditions) shows a large, broadband decrease when
the target was physically removed. Note that these two conditions are nearly identical perceptually. t values are indicated by gray scale values shown in inset.

(30–90 Hz), and then computing power changes in the different bands
over blocks (Supplementary Fig. 3 online). We reasoned that, given the
robust BOLD changes, there might be low-frequency modulation
during blocks in which the target was suppressed compared with
those in which it was continuously visible. In contrast to our expecta-
tions, we found no signiﬁcant decrease in the mean power for either the
low- or high-frequency bands during blocks of perceptual suppression
(P ¼ 0.69 and P ¼ 0.68, respectively, t test, 95 channels). In fact, we were
unable to ﬁnd any electrophysiological signal that, over the course of an
entire block, correlated with perceptual suppression.

To explore the basis of this negative ﬁnding, we next sought to
reproduce ﬁndings from our previous study, in which the LFP had
reﬂected stimulus visibility in V1. That study used the perceptual report
procedure (in different animals) and found that purely perceptual
signals were reﬂected in the modulation of the low-frequency LFP13.
We trained both monkeys to report the visi-
bility of target stimuli on trials that were all
identical, but in which the target had a 0.5
probability of being suppressed (see Methods).

In agreement with the previous results, we found clear and consistent
power decreases in the low-frequency LFP during suppressed trials
(Supplementary Fig. 4 online). We then asked whether perceptual
modulation had, in fact, been present in the block design trials, but had
been diluted because of the relatively small proportion of time in the
block in which the target was suppressed. To examine this possibility, we
conducted a trial-by-trial analysis of the block design data, beginning
with a time-frequency analysis.

We created spectrograms of the time course of power changes in
different frequency bands within trials of different block types (Fig. 4a).
We focused on the 2-s period following surround onset corresponding
to the period of perceptual suppression in the INV trials, or lack thereof
in the VIS trials. We evaluated which frequency components were
affected by suppression (INV-VIS) and compared the effects of suppres-
sion to those of physical removal (OFF-VIS), plotting the t score of the

physical removal of the visual target produced a large-amplitude
broadband decrease in power, but that perceptual suppression did not
(Supplementary Fig. 5 online). Consistent with the perceptual report
procedure, the strongest effect of suppression was a signiﬁcant decline in
the power of low frequencies (P o 0.001; Fig. 4c), matching the results
obtained from the reporting monkey described above.

We examined the high (30–90 Hz) and low (5–30 Hz) frequency
ranges, as well as spike rates, for each testing condition (the magnitude
of low-frequency power modulation can be seen more clearly in Fig. 5).
This analysis revealed that the perceptual suppression condition
(orange) deviated signiﬁcantly from (P o 0.001) the visible condition
(black) in the low-frequency LFP (black arrow), but not in high-
frequency LFP or in spiking (P ¼ 0.99 and P ¼ 0.90, respectively). In
fact, the only detectable electrophysiological difference between the
visible and invisible trials was this change in low-frequency LFP power.
These data are summarized in Figure 6, which shows the suppression
index, comparing the activity change during perceptual suppression to
that measured during the physical removal of the target. Of these
signals, it was the BOLD and low-frequency LFP that showed sub-
stantial declines relative to the control conditions, therein reﬂecting the
state of perceptual suppression.

DISCUSSION
These ﬁndings help to resolve a long-standing discrepancy between
human fMRI and monkey neurophysiology regarding the role of V1
in determining whether a stimulus is visible. The outcome of the
combined fMRI/electrophysiological approach demonstrates
that
the different conclusions reached by human fMRI and monkey
electrophysiology were not the results of either species or procedural
differences, but can instead be attributed to the nature of the signals
that were measured. Although consistent during conventional stimula-
tion, the BOLD and electrophysiological responses diverged markedly
during perceptual suppression.

It is interesting to consider that the BOLD fMRI signal, arguably the
furthest removed from neural processing, provided the most reliable
measure of the perceptual state, whereas the action potential ﬁring rate

provided the least. Why might this be the case? There are several possible
explanations. First, one cannot entirely rule out an electrophysiological
sampling bias that consistently missed a subpopulation of neurons,
perhaps because of their size, that carries the perceptual signal in V1 (see
ref. 23 for neuron-type speciﬁc modulation effects). Perceptual mod-
ulation in small, infrequently sampled neurons, such as interneurons
bearing a close relationship to vascular control24, might elicit a promi-
nent BOLD response. Another possibility is that perceptual suppression
results in a temporary and spatially localized mode of cortical processing
in which both inhibition and excitation are decreased, but remain in the
same balance. This scenario could produce a minimal or no change in
the spiking of neurons, but would provide a temporary relief of the
metabolic and vascular demands, leading to a decreased hemodynamic
response. Finally, it is also possible that seemingly unimportant mod-
ulatory signals distributed over a large population of neurons would
escape the notice of electrophysiological analysis, but would be effec-
tively registered in the BOLD response. Further experiments are
required to address these and other possibilities.

A potentially attractive explanation of our ﬁndings might be that
input to V1 from structures other than the LGN is disrupted during
perceptual suppression and that such disruption is better reﬂected in the
BOLD changes than in neural ﬁring. Considerable evidence suggests
that synaptic activity (stemming from afferent input and local intra-
cortical processing) might lead to BOLD responses, even in the absence
of ﬁring rate changes25–27. It has long been hypothesized that recurrent
input from extrastriate cortical areas into V1 accompanies selective
attention and stimulus awareness28,29. In this context, is also noteworthy
that a similar mismatch between fMRI and single-unit physiology has
been previously identiﬁed regarding the modulation of V1 by visual
attention30, suggesting that the dissociation observed here may arise in
conditions other than perceptual suppression. Recent work demonstrat-
ing laminar differences in the suppressive modulation of synaptic
currents in V1 (ref. 31) shows promise for providing a deeper under-
standing of both the neural mechanisms of perceptual suppression and
the enigmatic relationship between the fMRI signal and neural activity.
The lack of LFP power modulation over blocks of perceptual
suppression was unexpected, given that a clear LFP power modulation
was seen in the trial-based analysis of the same data, along with the clear
BOLD modulation in the block-based analysis. This result appears to
indicate that the BOLD response is not a simple reﬂection of integrated
neural activity over time. This negative ﬁnding may owe, in part, to a
low signal-to-noise ratio resulting from a dilution over large time
windows. However, it is interesting to consider that the robust suppres-
sion that we observed in the BOLD response might be shaped by only a
subset of neural events, which are punctuated and context speciﬁc. That
would have profound implications, as there could be no unique
hemodynamic transfer function to serve as a time-invariant convolution
ﬁlter to translate neural and BOLD signals, as is commonly assumed.
For example, neural modulation associated with the stimulus-driven
events may have a proportionally stronger contribution to the hemo-
dynamic response than do neural ﬂuctuations occurring between trials.
At the same time, recent work relating spontaneous neural activity in V1
to BOLD ﬂuctuations suggests that endogenous activity can also have a
strong effect on the fMRI response32.

Our results demonstrate that the very same signals that correlate
strongly with the BOLD signal in one context (physical stimulus
removal) fail to do so in another (perceptual suppression). The absence
of a ﬁxed relationship between the different neural signals is illustrated
conceptually in Figure 7. When a target stimulus eliciting a tonic neural
response is physically removed, all measured signals are consistent,
showing corresponding decreases in amplitude. On the other hand,

during perceptual suppression, the various responses become disso-
ciated and the BOLD signal no longer matches the neurophysiological
signals. Such context dependency might serve to explain discrepancies
among previous studies investigating the neural basis of the BOLD
signal25–27,33,34. Gaining a deeper understanding of the neural deter-
minants of the BOLD fMRI signal remains an important challenge for
systems neuroscience. The parallax provided by neural and hemody-
namic signals, each providing a window onto different brain function,
may eventually give mechanistic insights that neither technique could
provide alone.

METHODS
Subjects and testing. Two healthy adult male monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were
used in this study. All procedures followed US National Institutes of Health
guidelines, were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the US
National Institutes of Health (National Institute of Mental Health) and were
conducted with great care for the comfort and well being of the animals. Each
monkey had an magnetic resonance–compatible recording well implanted over
V1, which allowed for fMRI and neurophysiological testing on subsequent days.
A total of 41 multi-electrode recording sessions (27 and 14 sessions in Monkeys
CB35 and 98X009, respectively) and 29 fMRI sessions (8 and 16 sessions,
respectively, as well as 5 additional sessions with randomly ordered blocks)
were collected.

Stimulus and task design. All sessions were carried out while the animals were
awake and performing a task, either ﬁxation only or reporting target visibility.
In the block design task, visual stimuli were presented in 30- or 60-s epochs of
repeated 6-s trials of a given type. Animals were required to ﬁxate a small spot
until the completion of each trial to obtain an apple juice reward. Each stimulus
type consisted of a target pattern (a bright red disk, with a diameter of 41 of
visual angle (dva) for the majority of the experiments, was presented to the
parafovea in one quadrant), and a surrounding ﬁeld of randomly moving dots
(200–500 total dots of 0.51 diameter, covering an area of 401  301). The
random dots never approached within half a degree of the target stimulus. In
the suppression condition (INV), the stimulus parameters were adjusted such
that the presentation of the surround pattern resulted in perceptual suppression
of the target. In two ‘visible’ control conditions (VIS and VISTR), the
parameters were adjusted such that the target almost never disappeared. In
the ‘invisible’ control condition (OFF), the target was physically removed from
the screen on appearance of the dots. Blocks were either presented in a repeated

In most sessions, animals were tested in a block protocol consisting of 60-s
blocks of repeated presentations of the ﬁve different stimulus types (FIX, VISTR,

each line represents the state of presentation (stimulus either on or off), the

The left column represents the OFF condition. As shown in Figures 2–5, all
measures of neuronal activity, including the fMRI BOLD response, showed
a decline in signal when the stimulus was both physically removed and
perceptually disappeared. The right column represents our ﬁnding for the INV
condition, where the percept was dissociated from the physical stimulus in
the form of perceptual suppression. In that case, the spiking activity (and
high frequency LFP) maintained its activity level, reﬂecting the continually
present stimulus, whereas the fMRI response and (to a lesser extent) the low-
frequency LFP reﬂected the perceptual disappearance. Thus the relation
between the fMRI and neural signals differs under the two conditions.

VIS, OFF and INV). These blocks were presented either sequentially or in
pseudorandom order. In each block, the animals were required to ﬁxate for the
entire 6-s presentation of a particular stimulus condition, which was repeated
until the end of the block. The quality of ﬁxation was continually monitored.
Eye movements exceeding 1–21 away from the ﬁxation spot caused the trial to
abort. Note that because the monkeys had been trained to ﬁxate within 0.81 of
the ﬁxation spot, they kept their eyes in that region for the large majority of the
time (Supplementary Figs. 6–9 online). Following each successful trial, the
animal received a juice reward, accompanied by a short break (0.8–1 s) in which
the monkey was free to move its eyes about. There were typically 6–8 completed
trials each minute, depending on how well the animal acquired and maintained
ﬁxation (no signiﬁcant performance differences were found between the VIS,
VISTR, OFF and INV conditions in either animal).

Differential stimulation to the two eyes was achieved inside and outside the
scanner by ﬁxing anaglyph ﬁlters in front of the monkeys’ eyes and adjusting
the stimulus color accordingly (see Supplementary Methods online for
additional details).

Behavioral protocol. The experiments started after the monkeys were able to
hold and maintain ﬁxation on more than 95% of trials. Each session started
with a brief calibration procedure, during which the monkeys were presented
with a small (0.1–0.25 dva) ﬁxation spot at one of nine positions on the screen.
After the monkeys acquired and kept ﬁxation for 1–3 s, juice reward was
delivered and a new trial began. Following this procedure, we started the
experimental task, in which the monkeys had to ﬁxate a central spot on the
screen in a 1–4-dva window for up to 10 s to receive reward. If a monkey broke
ﬁxation, the trial was aborted and re-initiated after a short delay of 100–800 ms.
We carried out psychophysical testing in several separate test sessions outside
of the scanner. Stimulus disappearance was reported using custom-made levers
mounted inside the primate chair. One monkey had previously been trained to
report the physical and subjective removal of the target stimulus using a variety
of catch trials to ensure truthful perceptual report. The other monkey was
trained to do so at the end of the experimental sessions (for a more detailed
description of the methods used for behavioral training and testing of GFS, see
ref. 13). Stimulation parameters in the physiology testing booths matched those
used in the scanner.

Surgery. Monkeys were implanted under isoﬂurane anesthesia (1.5–2%) with
custom-designed and fabricated ﬁberglass headposts, which served to immo-
bilize the head during testing. Each monkey received a scleral search coil,
following a standard implantation procedure35. In a subsequent surgery, a
recording chamber was implanted over V1 using frameless stereotaxy guided by
high resolution anatomical magnetic resonance images (Brainsight, Rogue
Research), and a craniotomy was performed35. Animals received antibiotics
and analgesics post-operation.

fMRI scanning. Structural and functional images were acquired in a 4.7-T,
60-cm vertical scanner (Bruker Biospec) equipped with a Siemens AC44
gradient coil (40 mT m–1, o200 ms). Magnetic resonance–compatible primate
chairs were constructed and machined using plastic materials and with a
minimum of brass and aluminum parts. Monkeys were prevented from
performing excessive jaw movements by a chin rest that was mounted to the
top of the chair. Juice was delivered using an air-pressurized juicer device36

through custom-made brass mouth pieces. Exposure to scanner noise was
reduced by means of custom-formed ear plugs.

Monkeys were scanned over a period of 4 months (and two sessions of
conﬁrmatory retesting 12 months later) using two custom-built surface coils
situated over cortical area V1. The animals had previously been acclimated to
the scanner testing environment and worked continuously for up to 4 h.
Electrophysiological testing was conducted during the same testing period on
different days using the same animals, primate chairs, stimuli and behavioral
testing parameters, in designated electrophysiology booths.

Each session began with a localizer scan, in which the retinotopic area
corresponding to the salient target was identiﬁed. This localizer consisted of 60-s
blocks of trials alternating between presentation of the target, the surrounding
dots or a ﬁxation cross presented alone. Analysis of the main experiment was
restricted to those voxels that showed signiﬁcant decreases when the target was
physically removed in the context of the block design (in the OFF condition).
Transmit-and-receive radio frequency coils had dimensions ranging from
33  33 to 37  120 mm and were placed adjacent to the scalp of the animals
before they entered the magnet bore. The size and position of the coils were
optimized to achieve maximal sensitivity in the posterior portion of area V1 in
the occipital lobe. At the beginning of each session, active shimming was
achieved either by manual manipulation of the gain of the shim coils, by using
the FASTMAP37 procedure or by a combination of the two. To assess functional
cortical activation, a single shot gradient echo-planar imaging38 sequence was
used with a repetition time between 2.0 and 2.5 s and an echo time between 30
and 35 ms. Up to ten axial slices were collected with a ﬁeld of view ranging
from 96  113 mm to 128 128 mm and a slice thickness of 1.25–2 mm. The
in-plane resolution of the functional images was 1.5  1.5 mm for the majority
of the scans.

fMRI analysis. Data analysis was carried out on a PC running the Windows
operating system and custom-written software using MATLAB (MathWorks) as
well as the AFNI/SUMA software package39. To analyze fMRI data, raw images
were ﬁrst converted from the generic BRUKER into the common AFNI data
format. fMRI in monkeys is prone to image distortions arising from move-
ments and postural adjustments. We minimized distortions over time by
excluding time points for which ghosting or movement led to irreparable
image distortion, and applying the AFNI function 3dWarpDrive to each time
point, which applied an afﬁne transformation to each time point on a slice by
slice basis to match a reference slice. These measures substantially improved the
quality of the spatial mapping, as well as the BOLD time courses.

To analyze functional activation, we converted the adjusted images of each
scan into units of percent change by subtracting each run’s mean value from the
time series of each voxel, and subsequently dividing by the same value, on a
voxel-by-voxel basis. Note that for presentation purposes, we later subtracted
the mean activity during the ﬁxation condition from activity in the other
conditions, deﬁning it to be our baseline for comparing experimental condi-
tions). To correct for slow drifts in the magnetic resonance signal that were
unrelated to the task, we high-pass ﬁltered each scan using a bi-directional
second-order Butterworth ﬁlter with a cutoff frequency of 0.0025 Hz.

A region of interest was deﬁned as the target stimulus–responsive region
of primary visual cortex that showed signiﬁcant activity differences for
target versus nontarget presentation conditions deﬁned as any voxel in the
anatomical limits of V1 exhibiting a t value more than two s.d. away from the
average of the t score maps (Supplementary Fig. 1).

Neurophysiological recordings. Extracellular single-unit and LFP recordings
were carried out using sharp insulated microelectrodes and multi-contact
transcortical electrodes. Single-unit activity and LFPs were recorded from the
primary visual cortex of both animals. Recordings were carried out inside a
radio frequency–shielded booth that was also used for behavioral testing. In all
cases voltages were measured against a local reference that was close to the
electrode contacts (that is, a stainless steel guide tube or the hypodermic
metallic shaft surrounding the multi-contact electrodes). Recording electrodes
consisted of both single channel microelectrodes (Thomas Recording GmbH)
as well as 16- and 24-multicontact contact electrodes with an intercontact
spacing of 150 mm and 100mm, respectively (Neurotrack).

Single-unit and LFP activity was collected using both electrode types with
the MAP recording system (Plexon). The V1 sites were located dorsally, several
millimeters posterior to the lunate sulcus, and covered the parafoveal region
close to the vertical meridian.

Single units were isolated and characterized in terms of their basic response
characteristics using a custom-written program for receptive ﬁeld estimation.
Multiunit activity, in the form of voltage spikes exceeding a manually set
threshold, were collected and digitized by the MAP recording system. Single-
unit impulses were derived from the multiunit data by using a commercially
available spike sorting program (Plexon). The quality of isolation was assessed
and rated by two investigators, and only units with perfectly (that is, completely
unambiguous) isolated clusters were included in the analysis. The LFPs
(measured as voltage ﬂuctuations between 1 and 100 Hz) were collected
simultaneously using the same system and digitized at 1 kHz. Notably, during
all of the recording sessions, the monkeys’ task was similar in every respect to
that inside the scanner. All behavioral and stimulus events were encoded and
recorded together with the neuronal signal on a separate channel to align the
data during post hoc analysis.

Neuronal data analysis. All neurophysiological data was processed and
analyzed using custom-written code for MATLAB. Single-unit spiking data
was converted into spike-density functions with a sample rate of 1 kHz by
replacing each spike time with a Gaussian kernel. LFPs were resampled at 1 kHz
and converted into microvolts as a function of time. Spectrograms were
computed using the Fast Fourier Transform with a running window size of
256 ms and an overlap of 255 ms or the multitaper method (CHRONUX
toolbox for Matlab, http://www.chronux.org/) using similar parameters. Both
techniques yielded highly similar results.

In addition, we subdivided the LFP data into different bands in the
frequency domain using a second-order, bi-directional, zero-phase Chebyshev
type-1 ﬁlter. The resulting band-limited signals were full-wave rectiﬁed by
taking their absolute value, and resampled at 200 Hz. Rectifying the band-
limited voltage ﬂuctuations results in a measure of time-varying amplitude, or
signal power (in actuality, the square root of the power), in each frequency
band. This band-limited power (BLP) is roughly equivalent to averaging several
adjacent rows of a spectrogram (for an extended discussion, see ref. 40). For
conditions in which percent change above baseline was computed, the baseline
was taken to be the mean ﬁring rate or mean band-limited LFP power
measured during the ﬁxation period.
