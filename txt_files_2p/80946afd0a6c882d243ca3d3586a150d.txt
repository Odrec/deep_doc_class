Summary. — The rural economy of Lesotho is characterized by dependence on circular labor
migration to South African mines and declining agricultural output per capita. This paper attempts
to improve the understanding of the relationship between circular labor migration and agricultural
production by comparing the technical e(cid:129)ciency of farms that supply migrant laborers with that of
farms that do not. Through analysis of the relative technical e(cid:129)ciency of these two farm categories
conclusions are drawn concerning the likely impact of changing migration patterns on the
agricultural sector. (cid:211) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

1. INTRODUCTION

It would be di(cid:129)cult

to exaggerate the
signiﬁcance of labor migration in Lesotho(cid:213)s
economy. Over a quarter of the male labor
force of Lesotho is engaged in mine employ-
ment in South Africa. These workers are typi-
cally on ﬁxed-term contracts
spanning 12
months which require them to return to Leso-
tho before a renewal. The migrants’ remittances
make up over 80% of factor income from
abroad which constituted 40% to 50% of
Lesotho’s gross national product during 1983–
91 with a marginal decline in subsequent years
(Bureau of Statistics, 1992; Cobbe, 1995). At
the household level, remittances from migrant
laborers in South Africa are the main source of
income for about 35% of homesteads and 70%
of households have had at least one member as
a migrant worker. Similar oscillatory labor
migration has been signiﬁcant in the economies
of Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland
and Zimbabwe.

Recent social, political and economic transi-
tions in South Africa have made the future of
circular labor ﬂows uncertain and raised ques-
tions about
reduced

impact of

the social

remittance ﬂows in the region (Leliveld, 1997;
Crush & James, 1995; Gustafsson & Makon-
nen, 1993). By 1997, South African mine
employment had fallen by one-third from its
level
in the mid-1980s and the number of
miners from Lesotho had fallen to its lowest
level since the early 1970s. Further retrench-
ments in mining employment appear likely. The
implications of
for
employment in South Africa and the policy
response to this threat depend on the relation-
ship between oscillatory labor migration and

complementary, reduced mining employment
will issue a double blow to the economy.

The unresolved question concerning labor
migration and agricultural production is
whether remittance incomes enhance produc-
tion enough to compensate for the reduced
availability of labor in any speciﬁc setting. The
impacts of both remittance income and labor
migration have generated a large literature.
Among others, Murray (1981) and Stark (1980)
argue that remittance ﬂows can be critical for
enhanced agricultural
investment and farm
management. Rempel and Lobdell (1978) and
Palmer (1985) in contrast, stress the potential
for remittances to substitute for rural produc-
tion or be modest in volume.1 Francis and
Hoddinott(cid:213)s (1993) detailed case study of a
Kenyan community indicates that migration
has facilitated investment in education, not
agriculture. Francis and Hoddinott(cid:213)s analysis
uncovers a residual
impact of migration on
household income, but not on agricultural
productivity. Aside from village case studies,
empirical analyses relating circular migration to
agricultural productivity remain limited. With
the exception of Lucas (1985), analyses of the
national or sectoral impact of migration in sub-
Saharan African tend to emphasize either the
positive role of remittances or the negative
eects of reduced labor, increased consumption
and inﬂation (IBRD, 1990; Plath, Holland &
Carvalho, 1987).

to assess

This paper uses a detailed microeconomic
data set
the impact of circular
migration on Lesotho(cid:213)s agricultural sector. The
analysis is motivated by a need to understand
whether agricultural production is likely to
mitigate the eects of
reduced remittance
income or become a victim of it. The study uses
a stochastic frontier model (Aigner, Lovell &
Schmidt, 1977) to assess the technical ine(cid:129)-
ciency of farms currently sending migrants and
those that do not. Given the fungibility of
money, this approach may suggest more about
the impact of receipts on agricultural output
than survey questions concerning the volume
and use of remittance income. The analysis
focuses on agricultural production, rather than
household income, to ascertain sectoral impacts
of changes in migration patterns. It concen-
trates on the current impact of remittances
rather than their residual eects to assess the
immediate consequences of reduced migration
for agricultural output.

Until recently, mining jobs have been allo-
cated through a queuing process in which

among

households

essentially all rural households participated.2
Consequently, the central dierence between
households with migrant remittances and those
without is the relative availability of ﬁnance
and labor. If households currently sending
migrants can be assumed to have more cash
than those without migrant income, compari-
son of the two groups sheds light on the
importance of ﬁnancial
liquidity for agricul-
tural production. A ﬁnding of lower technical
ine(cid:129)ciency
supplying
migrants would imply that greater access to
capital through remittances generates increased
agricultural productivity, despite the reduced
availability of labor. By contrast, lower tech-
nical ine(cid:129)ciency in nonmigrant farms would
suggest that labor migration is currently detri-
mental to agricultural production. Meanwhile,
any dierence in farm e(cid:129)ciency between the
two groups would suggest: (a) that there are
options to improve agricultural output using
existing production technologies and (b) that
in factor markets may constrain
rigidities
management
to diering degrees based on
household supplies of labor or ﬁnance.

2. CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

The theoretical model posits a production
possibilities frontier that maps out the maxi-
mum possible output for any combination of
input quantities. Such a frontier can be esti-
mated based on a production function that
relates output (y) to inputs (cid:133)x1 . . . xn(cid:134) such that
y (cid:136) f(cid:133)x1 . . . xn(cid:134). Following Farrel
(1957),
measurement of technical ine(cid:129)ciency is based
on a comparison of
the output actually
obtained and the output that the production
function would predict for the level of inputs
used. Because rainfall and other agricultural
inputs cannot be controlled, some deviation
between actual and predicted output is expec-
ted for all
farms. Systematic dierences in
degrees of technical ine(cid:129)ciency between groups
would imply, however,
that one group is
persistently less able to apply inputs as eec-
tively as
the other. Hence, a relationship
between migrancy status and technical ine(cid:129)-
ciency can suggest whether circular migration
facilitates or hampers farm management.

Technical

ine(cid:129)ciency is a measure of
management error, rather than income or gross
output. Lower ine(cid:129)ciency does not correspond
to greater yields or greater income. By applying
fewer inputs in a consistent and timely manner,
