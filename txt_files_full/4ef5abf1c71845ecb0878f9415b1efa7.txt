Abstract

Nine recently reported parapsychological experiments appear to support the existence of precognition. We describe three
pre-registered independent attempts to exactly replicate one of these experiments, ‘retroactive facilitation of recall’, which
examines whether performance on a memory test can be influenced by a post-test exercise. All three replication attempts
failed to produce significant effects (combined n = 150; combined p = .83, one-tailed) and thus do not support the existence
of psychic ability.

Introduction

Bem [1] reported nine parapsychological experiments designed
to test the possible existence of precognition. The experiments
involved ‘time reversing’ well-known psychological effects, explor-
ing whether participants’ responses could be influenced by future
events. Eight of these experiments obtained statistically significant
main effects. In five of the experiments, participants’ scores on a
‘Stimulus Seeking Scale’ (SSS) significantly correlated with their
scores on a test of precognitive ability. Bem ended his paper by
urging psychologists to attempt to replicate his findings and be
more open to the notion of psychic ability.

Bem’s experiments have attracted considerable controversy,
with much of the debate focusing on various statistical issues. For
example, some statisticians [2,3] have argued that Bem’s results
would not provide evidence for precognition if they were evaluated
using a Bayesian, rather than frequentist, analysis. In response,
Bem and colleagues [4] argued that the priors used in the Bayesian
analyses were unrealistically low (though see [5]). In addition, it
has been noted [2,5] that the effect size in Bem’s experiments is
negatively related to the number of participants,
suggesting
evidence of optional stopping. Finally, the experiments have been
criticised for not
the potential effects of
multiple analyses [6].

recall. The current

Bem’s Experiments 8 and 9 involved an alleged retroactive
facilitation of
three pre-
registered, independent attempts to replicate the ninth experiment,
which was chosen for two reasons. First, it obtained the largest
effect size of all nine experiments (d = .42). This was more than
double the effect size of the eighth experiment (d = .19), which had
a similar design. Second, Bem stated that it would prove among
the easiest of the experiments to replicate successfully.

participants then undertook post-test practice exercises: First, the
program randomly selected half of the words from the original list
(referred to as ‘practice’ words) and presented them to the
participants again. Second, participants
sorted these selected
words into categories, and typed them into on-screen boxes
(Experiment 8 did not include the first of these exercises, which
Bem suggested was
the reason it yielded a smaller effect).
Participants did not see the non-selected words (referred to as
‘control’ words) again. Bem found that participants had recalled
significantly more ‘practice’ than ‘control’ words in the initial
recall test, suggesting a relationship between their recall perfor-
mance and the words that they would see in the future.

Although Bem did not find a significant correlation between
participants’ performance on the test of precognitive ability and
their scores on the Stimulus Seeking Scale in Experiment 9, two of
the replications reported here employed the scale for complete-
ness. The scale was not administered to participants in the third
attempted replication due to time constraints.

When discussing the issue of replication, Bem highlighted the
importance of ensuring adequate statistical power and trying to
minimise the influence of subtle factors that might alter the
outcome of the study. In addition, it has been noted that close
replications are preferable to procedural or conceptual replica-
tions, since they allow for more accurate comparisons between
experiments and provide less ambiguous results [7]. This is
particularly true in controversial areas such as parapsychology [8].
For these reasons, each of our attempted replications used the
same number of participants as in Bem’s Experiment 9, and
employed an almost identical procedure.

Methods

During Experiment 9, a computer program presented partic-
ipants with a serial list of words, and then asked them to type all of
the words
into the computer. The

they could remember

The attempted replications were pre-registered [9] and carried
out at three separate laboratories: Replication 1, The University of
Edinburgh; Replication 2, Goldsmiths, The University of London;

and Replication 3, The University of Hertfordshire. The three
experiments received approval from The University of Edinburgh
Psychology Research Ethics Committee, the Goldsmiths Research
Ethics Committee, and the University of Hertfordshire Ethics
Committee, respectively. Written consent was obtained from all
participants prior to the experimental procedure.

Participants

Power analysis using G*Power 3.0 [10] indicated that, to have
80% power to detect the same effect size as that in Bem’s original
experiment (d = .42), we would require at least 41 participants in
each replication attempt.

Replication 1: 50 undergraduate and graduate students (33
female, 17 male; mean age 22.00 years, SD = 6.17) were rewarded
with course credit for participation, and were recruited online,
using the same information Bem provided to his participants.

Replication 2: 50 volunteers, mostly students (27 female, 23
male; mean age 24.24 years, SD = 4.99), were paid £5 each for
participation, and were recruited by a variety of means including
word of mouth, appeals for participants after lectures, and an
online appeal.

Replication 3: 50 volunteers (27 female, 23 male; mean age
21.12 years, SD = 5.27) were recruited online, or were known to
the experimenter. Those recruited online were students and were
rewarded with course credit.

list

the ‘uncommon’

The computer program used to test participants was kindly
provided by Bem, along with the list of 48 stimulus words used in
his original study. These words were drawn from four different
categories – ‘foods’, ‘occupations’, ‘animals’ and ‘clothes’. Within
each category, half of the words had been categorised as ‘common’
and half as ‘uncommon’ (it should be noted that the frequency
norm set used by Bem [11] does not support this categorisation.
For example,
includes some words (e.g.
‘carpenter’, ‘rabbi’) that have a frequency higher than or almost as
high as some words from the ‘common’ list (e.g. ‘hamburger’,
‘apple’)). As all three replication attempts were carried out in the
UK rather than the US, five of these stimulus words were changed
to make them more familiar to participants (‘jockstrap’, ‘parka’,
‘suspenders’ and ‘pantyhose’ were replaced with ‘thong’, ‘anorak’,
‘waistcoat’ and ‘tights’, respectively). The replacement words were
chosen to ensure that they were similar in frequency to the original
words. In addition, the word ‘yogurt’ was changed to its British
English spelling (‘yoghurt’). All other stimulus words were identical
to those employed in the original study.

Stimulus Seeking Scale (SSS). The SSS was created by Bem
and consists of two items (‘I often enjoy seeing movies I’ve seen
before’, ‘In general, I am easily bored’ [reverse scored]) that are
answered using a 5-point scale ranging from ‘1’ (Very Untrue) to
‘5’ (Very True). It has been noted that this scale has not been
tested for validity or reliability [6]. Participants in our Replication
3 were not administered the SSS.

Experimenters

When discussing the issue of replication, Bem [1] drew special
attention to the role of experimenter effects, arguing that a
skeptical experimenter might be more likely to obtain a null effect
than one more open to the possibility of psychic ability. To help
overcome this potential issue, Bem describes how he specifically
designed the study to be run by a computer (thus minimizing the
experimenter’s role) and using only informally-trained undergrad-

Failing the Future

uate experimenters. In line with these guidelines, only Replication
1 was carried out by the Principal Investigator - Replication 2 was
conducted by the Principal Investigator’s research assistants, and
Replication 3 was carried out by an undergraduate student as part
of a project being supervised by the Principal Investigator.

Procedure

tested individually in a quiet

Before the procedure began, all participants were aware that the
experiment tested for paranormal abilities, having been informed
by the recruitment materials and/or the consent form. Each
participant was
room. The
experimenter (Replication 1) or the research assistant (Replications
2 and 3) started the computer program and then left the room.
After completing the SSS, participants experienced a three-minute
relaxation period in which they listened to ‘New Age’ music
(through headphones or over speakers) while observing photo-
graphs of outer space.

The computer then presented participants with 48 stimulus
words one at a time in a pseudo-random order (the same for each
session). The words were presented for 3 seconds each, with a 1-
second gap between each word. An on-screen instruction asked
participants to form a mental image of the referent of each word as
it appeared. Next, a memory test screen asked participants to
recall as many of the words as possible and type them into on-
screen boxes. Participants were given up to 5 minutes to complete
this task.

The program then randomly selected 24 words (3 common and
3 uncommon from each category) to be ‘practice’ words, and the
remaining 24 to be ‘control’ words. The practice words were then
shown to participants one at a time in category order. Finally, the
participants were shown all 24 practice words at once, and asked
to click the words that came from a specified category, and type
those words into boxes. This was repeated for each of the four
categories, and was designed to encourage participants to focus
their attention on the practice words. No time limit was imposed
for this part of the procedure.

In a debrief session, participants were informed they had taken
part in an attempted replication of a previous parapsychological
study that had produced positive results and, as per Bem’s
procedure, could see on the computer screen the percentage of
‘practice’ versus ‘control’ words they had recalled.

Data Analysis

SSS scoring.

In line with Bem’s original experiment,
participants’ scores were averaged across the two SSS items into
a single score. Those with scores greater than 2.5 were then
classified as ‘high stimulus seekers’ whilst those with scores less
than or equal to 2.5 were classified as ‘low stimulus seekers’.

list (e.g., typing ‘car’

Coding of unrecognised words. Wiseman [12] described a
flaw in the procedure Bem used to analyse his data. As participants
may have misspelled remembered words during the free recall test
(e.g., typing ‘ctt’ instead of ‘cat’) or come up with words that were
not on the original
instead of ‘cat’), the
scoring software was designed to automatically flag up any words
that were not identical to the words in the original
list. The
experimenter then worked through these unrecognised words
manually, and either corrected the spelling or told the software to
ignore them because they did not appear on the original list. To
prevent any possibility of unconscious bias,
the experimenter
should have corrected these words blind to their status,
i.e.,
whether they were in the ‘practice’ or ‘control’ list. Unfortunately,
this was not the case. Bem acknowledged the fault, but argued that
there was very little difference between the scores before and after
correction [12].

three attempted replications overcame this potential
problem by having all of the unrecognised words coded by two

straightforward way

Calculating the ‘Differential Recall percentage’. Perhaps
the most
participants’
performance involves subtracting the number of practice words
recalled from the number of control words recalled, and testing the
significance of the outcome by conducting a one-sample t-test
against a theoretical mean of zero.

of

assessing

However, Bem analysed his results by calculating a weighted
‘Differential Recall percentage’ (DR%) for each participant. The
DR% was equal to ([(P2C)6(P+C)]/576)6100, where P was the
number of ‘practice’ words recalled and C was the number of
‘control’ words recalled. The DR% ranged from 2100% to 100%;
a positive DR% indicated that more practice words were recalled
than controls, whilst a negative score indicated that more controls
were recalled. A score of zero indicated recall of an equal number
of practice and control words. The significance of the DR% was
determined by conducting a one-sample t-test against a theoretical
mean of zero. To allow a direct comparison between the outcomes
of the replication attempts and Bem’s original study, all three
experiments employed the DR% as the main outcome measure,
with the ‘unweighted’ measure reported for completeness.

1- or 2-tailed p-values? One-tailed t-tests are reported
throughout Bem’s paper [1]. This approach has been criticised
on the basis that it may inflate Type I errors [6]. Bem and
colleagues have defended the procedure [4], noting that,
for
instance, Experiment 9 was a replication of significant effects
obtained in Experiment 8 (although it should be noted that Bem
also used one-tailed tests in Experiment 8, i.e., before the effect in
question had been replicated). In line with Bem’s original analysis
and the arguments subsequently presented by Bem and colleagues
[4], the results of all three replication attempts reported here were
analysed using one-tailed p-values. One consequence of
this
decision is that any results in the opposite direction to that

predicted cannot be considered to be statistically significant no
matter how extreme they may be [13]. In general,
for most
statistical tests, the one-tailed p-value is simply half of the two-
tailed p-value (thus increasing the possibility of a Type I error).
However,
if the difference is in the opposite direction to that
predicted, the p-value is one minus half the two-tailed p-value.

Results

Table 1 contains the mean recall score along with the mean
DR% and associated p-value, for all three replication attempts
separately and combined. All of these results were non-significant.
Table 2 contains the ‘uncorrected’ (excluding unrecognised words
due to participants’ typographical or spelling mistakes) and ‘unweight-
ed’ mean scores (number of practice words recalled subtracted from the
number of control words recalled) of all three replication attempts
separately and combined. All results were non-significant.

categorised as ‘high stimulus seekers’ and ‘low stimulus seekers’,
and the correlation between participants’ scores on the SSS and

Discussion

This paper reports three independent attempts to replicate the
retroactive facilitation of recall effect [1]. All three experiments
employed almost exactly the same procedure and software as the
original experiment. In addition, they used the same number of
participants as the original study and thus had sufficient statistical
power to detect an effect (our three experiments combined had
99.92% power to detect the same effect size).

While Bem found a substantial effect, our results failed to
provide any evidence for retroactive facilitation of recall. Although
we opted to follow Bem’s preferred strategy of using one-tailed
tests, we acknowledge that
this
approach [13] and it might be objected that had we opted for the
generally more accepted approach of using two-tailed tests, we
would indeed have had one statistically significant finding to

report, i.e., the finding that the high SS participants in Replication
2 recalled fewer of the practice words than the control words. We
feel that it is safe to dismiss this finding as almost certainly spurious
given the relatively large number of statistical tests carried out and
the fact that the difference is in the opposite direction to that
predicted by Bem. Furthermore, no such trend was discernable in
the other experiment that collected SS scores.

One interpretation of these findings centres on the possibility that
Bem’s original effect was due to the types of statistical and
methodological artifacts outlined by several critics [2,3,5,6,7]. Similar
arguments apply to the alleged correlation between participants’
performance on the test of precognition and their scores on the
Stimulus Seeking Scale. This scale was far from the only variable
recorded during Bem’s studies. In fact, several other variables are
recorded by the experimental program but are not mentioned by
Bem, including participant age, their test anxiety level, and how often
they have used meditation or self-hypnosis. The experimenter is also
asked to record how enthusiastic each participant appears, and how
‘friendly’ they are towards the experimenter. It is unclear whether the
relationship between participants’ scores on the tests of precognitive
ability and such variables were examined.

Alternatively, it may be the case that the effect is genuine, but
problematic to replicate. Replication issues have long dogged
parapsychology, with proposed explanations focusing on experi-
mental artifacts, fraud, or variation in psi ability on the part of
both participants and experimenters [14,15]. It has also been
suggested that psi is elusive, and does not lend itself to laboratory
study in the same manner as other psychological effects [16].

However, as noted above, Bem explicitly stated that Experiment
9 should be among the easiest of his studies to replicate [1], and all
three Principal Investigators went to considerable lengths to ensure
that
their attempted replications matched his original study.
Experimenter involvement was kept to a minimum by the use of
the same computer programs used in the original experiment, and
any potential experimenter effects in two of the studies were
minimised by having student assistants conduct them.

The only noteworthy difference between Bem’s experiment and
our replication attempts is that we conducted our experiments after

his had received substantial media attention. Thus, the possibility
arises that, since some of our participants might have heard of Bem’s
study, they may have known what to expect in the procedure. This
could have influenced their performance, perhaps leading them to
explicitly attempt to memorize the stimulus words (we are grateful to
an anonymous reviewer for bringing this potential limitation to our
attention). However, while the participants knew the experiment
concerned ESP, they were not informed that it was a replication
attempt of a specific study until after they completed the procedure.
In addition, the computer’s random selection of words after the
memory test meant that foreknowledge of the procedure should not
have influenced the results in any particular direction.

Our failure to find similar results even after three close
replication attempts, along with the methodological and statistical
issues discussed above and at least one other published report of a
failed replication attempt [17], leads us to favour the ‘experimental
artifacts’ explanation for Bem’s original result.

At the end of his paper Bem urges psychologists to be more
open towards the concept of psychic ability, noting how, in Alice in
Wonderland, the White Queen famously stated, ‘Why, sometimes
I’ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast’.
We advise them to take a more levelheaded approach to the topic,
and not to venture too far down the rabbit hole just yet.
