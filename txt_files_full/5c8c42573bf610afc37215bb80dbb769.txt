Remaks

at the Pfoertner: there is a Tacker and you can (ask him to)
open the window to just put your homework in the right
folder thing

so idk, do that if you want, he’d appreciate it I guess :)

Common Mistakes/Remarks

the identical sign (exercise 1.3 and 1.5)
∀y (y = b ∧ Gby ) and
∃x∀y (Gaax ∧ (∃z(F → Hz) ∨ Fxy = Gddc))
pay attention to the order of arguments / to the designation
of argument positions (exercise 2)
∀x(Gx ∧ ¬Hax → Fx)

exercise 3

’diﬀerence in translation’ refers to possible ambiguity of the
sentence, not of diﬀerent formalizations of the same sentence
meaning

let’s take a look at the Musterloesung and try to understand,
what the thinking process is...

Lecture 7

Important New Stuﬀ

Semantics of Lpred
interpretation of an Lpred sentence (”assignment in truth
table”)

expansion of a formula in some universe
semantic tree method or Lpred

Lecture 7

Interpretation and Universes

interpretation in Lpred consists of:

set of all elements called Universe or Domain
assignment of exactly one element of the universe to each
proper name
assignment of a set for each predicate, which contains tuples
of elements that render that predicate true
truth values of all literals

Lecture 7

Extension of formulas

basically: get rid of all quantiﬁers by correctly assigning
elements from the universe

with interpretation + extension one can determine the truth
value of the formula under that interpretation

examples!

∃y∀x((Fxy ∨ Hxy ) ∧ Gyx)

U: {c1, c2, c3}
F: {< c1, c3 >, < c2, c3 >, < c1, c1 >}
G: {< c1, c2 >, < c2, c2 >, < c3, c1 >, < c3, c2 >, < c3, c3 >}
H: {< c3, c3 >}
∀x∃y (Fxy → Gyx)
U: {c1, c2, c3}
F: {< c1, c2 >, < c2, c3 >, < c3, c1 >}
G: {< c2, c1 >, < c2, c2 >, < c3, c3 >}

Lecture 7

Four new rules

Universal (U)

∀xS(x)
S(a)
replace all occurences of x with the same name

Existential (E)

∃xS(x)
S(a)
name must not have occured on a previous line in the branch

Negated Universal/Existential

¬∀xS(x)
∃x¬S(x)
¬∃xS(x)
∀x¬S(x)

Lecture 7

Remarks on Semantic Trees

always reduce negated quantiﬁers ﬁrst

then reduce existential quantiﬁers

for universal quantiﬁers: smartly choose names that have
already occured

if it doesn’t work: no conclusion possible, might just be our
mistake

method cannot be used for formulas featuring ’=’

for that, you’ll learn an extension of GLC
