Phrenology

(cid:73) Gall & Spurzheim (early 19th century)
(cid:73) Brain regions are specialized for functions
(cid:73) Mental attributes can be read oﬀ from bumps on the skull
(cid:73) (Psychograph is from the Science Museum of Minnesota)

[Wikimedia][Link]

Opening the Skull

(cid:73) Cortex and cerebellum
(cid:73) Gyri, sulci
(cid:73) Frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital lobe

[Wikimedia]

Anatomy by Eye

(cid:73) White and gray matter
(cid:73) Two hemispheres connected by corpus callosum
(cid:73) Nuclei, ventricles

[Wikimedia]

Under The Microscope

(cid:73) You need stains to see

anything

(cid:73) Cajal establishes neuron
doctrine based on Golgi
stain (joint Nobel prize
in 1906)

[Wikimedia]

Neurons and Synapses

(cid:73) Neurons have cell
bodies, dendrites
(inputs) and an axon
(outputs)

(cid:73) The connections

between neurons are
chemical synapses

[Wikimedia]

Brodmann’s Areas

(cid:73) Using stains Brodmann (in 1909) distinguished 52 regions

of the brain in terms of their cytoarchitecture

(cid:73) Many of these areas have also proven to be functionally
relevant (e.g., area 17 is now called primary visual cortex
or V1)

[Wikimedia]

Structure and Function

(cid:73) Some brain structures are highly regular, e.g. cerebellum
(cid:73) Is it possible to infer the function from the structure?
(cid:73) Is the cerebellum involved in timing or learning?

[Braitenberg, 1973, p. 74]

Microcircuits in the Cortex

(cid:73) The basic structure in cortex is the cortical column
(cid:73) How are diﬀerent kinds of neurons organized and

connected to each other in each column?

(cid:73) Canonical microcircuits are unraveled by neuroanatomy

and electrophysiology (as we will see later)

[Martin, 2002]

The Human Brain Project

(cid:73) Make a detailed anatomical and physiological model of a

cortical column

(cid:73) Simulate it on a super computer with the long-term goal

of simulating a whole brain (that will think?)

[Markram, 2006]

Cerebral Networks

(cid:73) Not every cortical area
is connected to every
other cortical area

(cid:73) Detailed anatomical

studies are required to
trace the connections
between areas

(cid:73) The visual system is

organized hierarchically

[Felleman and Van Essen, 1991]

Connectomics

(cid:73) Is it possible to get a wiring diagram of a whole brain?
(cid:73) C. elegans has 302 neurons with 5000 synapses and the

“connectome” is known

(cid:73) The human brain has 1011 neurons each with on the

order of thousands of synapses

[Briggman and Denk, 2006]

Electrophysiology and the Frog

(cid:73) Galvani (1737-1789) made frog legs twitch (he built a

battery without knowing that he did)

(cid:73) This made him believe in “animal electricity” (Galvanism)

[Wikimedia]

Action Potentials (aka Spikes)

(cid:73) Spikes are stereotyped

and all-or-none
(remember
McCulloch-Pitts)

(cid:73) The giant squid axon is
big enough to insert an
electrode

(cid:73) This allowed the ﬁrst

intracellular recording of
an action potential

[Hodgkin and Huxley, 1939]

Rate Coding

(cid:73) Recordings are made
from a nerve that is
connected to a frog
muscle with muscle
spindles

(cid:73) The muscle is stretched
by hanging weights on
it and this leads to a
rhythmic electrical
response

(cid:73) Frequency increases

with weight

[Adrian and Zotterman, 1926]

Receptive Fields

(cid:73) Some cells have small receptive ﬁelds and only respond to

touch in a small area on the hand (left)

(cid:73) Other cells have large receptive ﬁelds and respond to

touch in larger areas (right)

[Johansson and Valbo, 1983]

Topographic Organization

(cid:73) Penﬁeld performed

electrical stimulation on
the primary sensory and
primary motor cortex of
patients undergoing
brain surgery to treat
epilepsy

(cid:73) Patients were awake

and could report their
sensations

[Penﬁeld and Boldrey, 1937]

Topographic Organization

(cid:73) Areas that are close on
the body also tend to
be close in cortex
(cid:73) Sizes are distorted:
Hands, mouth, and
tongue are
overrepresented

[Penﬁeld and Boldrey, 1937]

Population Coding

(cid:73) 3d direction of hand

movement is coded in
motor cortex

(cid:73) Each neuron is most

sensitive for one
direction in space
(cid:73) By pooling over a

population of neurons
the 3d hand movement
can be reconstructed

[Georgopoulos et al., 1986]

Neural Decoding for Brain Computer Interfaces

(cid:73) The activity in the motor cortex can be read out and used

to control a robot arm

(cid:73) The long-term aim is to use this also in humans (clinical

trials are on the way)

[Wessberg et al., 2000]

What Is the Neural Code?

(cid:73) How do neurons code sensory inputs and motor outputs?
(cid:73) Single neurons vs populations
(cid:73) Single spike timing vs ﬁring rates
(cid:73) Correlations or synchrony between neurons
(cid:73) Strategy: Try out codes and see how well one can

reconstruct stimulus or response

Lesion Studies

(cid:73) What can we say about higher cognitive functions?
(cid:73) Idea: If a brain area is involved in a cognitive function

then a lesion of this area will result in a cognitive deﬁcit
for this function

(cid:73) In humans: Brain injuries by accident, war, illness, stroke,

etc.

(cid:73) In animals: Experimental lesions

Example: Dorsal and Ventral Stream

(cid:73) Lesions in the ventral stream lead to impairment of object

identiﬁcation but not object localization

(cid:73) Lesions in the dorsal stream lead to impairment of object

localization but not object identiﬁcation

(cid:73) Such a pattern is called a double dissociation

[Mishkin et al., 1983]

Example: Dorsal and Ventral Stream

(cid:73) Patient DF has a ventral stream lesion with shape agnosia
(cid:73) She cannot indicate the size of an object (A)
(cid:73) But she can grasp it (B)

Localized or Distributed Function?

(cid:73) Maze learning in rats or

its memory engram
does not seem to
depend on a single area
(cid:73) The more of the cortex
is destroyed the worse
the performance

(cid:73) If vision is destroyed
they could still use
olfaction, hence
sub-functions could still
be localized

[Lashley, 1950]

What Do Lesions Tell Us?

(cid:73) Diﬀerent patients have diﬀerent and diﬀuse lesions
(cid:73) Patients are often not just impaired in a single function
(cid:73) There might be other secondary eﬀects, like

injury-induced depression, that could impair a function

(cid:73) Interruption of a function by a lesion does not mean that

this function is localized in the respective area

(cid:73) Strongest evidence comes from double dissociations but is

not fool-proof

(cid:73) Functions may still be distributed over the brain and not

localized in one area

Non-invasive Brain Imaging

(cid:73) Electroencephalography (EEG) measures electrical

activity outside the scalp

(cid:73) Magnetoencephalography (MEG) picks up the magnetic

ﬁelds that are induced by the currents in the brain
(cid:73) Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measures optical

properties that change with activity through the skull

(cid:73) Positron emission tomography (PET) measures the

concentration of radioactive markers for neural activity

(cid:73) Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) makes use of the

diﬀerent magnetic properties of diﬀerent tissues that can
also be activity dependent

(cid:73) Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) delivers strong
magnetic pulses through the skull (not strictly imaging)

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)

(cid:73) The diﬀerent magnetic properties of diﬀerent tissues can

be measured non-invasively with a MRI machine in 3d

(cid:73) For this a very strong magnet is required

[Wikimedia][Wikimedia]

Diﬀusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)

(cid:73) MRI machines can also

be used to trace the
tracts of white matter
(i.e. the connections
between brain areas)
(cid:73) This is based on the

diﬀerential diﬀusion of
water molecules along
and orthogonal to nerve
ﬁbers

(cid:73) Used to map the human

connectome

[Wikimedia]

Functional MRI (fMRI)

(cid:73) Measures blood oxygenation

level dependent (BOLD)
signal (magnetic properties
change with blood
oxygenation)

(cid:73) BOLD signal is only

indirectly related to neural
activity and seems to reﬂect
the input to an area and not
spiking activity

[Logothetis et al., 2001]

Brain Decoding (aka Mind Reading)

(cid:73) Diﬀerent stimuli lead to diﬀerent patterns of response
(cid:73) Patterns can be used to decode stimulus from response

[Haxby et al., 2001]

What Does fMRI Tell Us?

(cid:73) Often an attempt at localization of function
(cid:73) fMRI complements lesion studies (areas are involved in

normal functioning)

(cid:73) Be aware of the complicated (statistical) analysis between

signal and image

(cid:73) Be aware of the power of images [McCabe and Castel, 2008]
(cid:73) Great prospect of uncovering interplay of brain areas to

understand information processing (not yet realized)

(cid:73) This requires a detailed analysis of the cognitive task and

modeling the relationship between cognitive processes,
brain areas, and BOLD response

(cid:73) The relation between neural activity and BOLD response

is complicated (microcircuits, excitation or inhibition,
input or output, metabolic costs) [Logothetis, 2008]

Summary

(cid:73) Neurons and synapses are the building blocks of the

circuits in the brain

(cid:73) We do not have a complete wiring diagram of a human

brain but do know quite a bit about its anatomy

(cid:73) Spikes are the basic units of information processing
(cid:73) The ﬁring rate carries information about the stimulus but

the neural code is not completely understood yet

(cid:73) Lesions give us hints about which brain areas are involved

in which cognitive function

(cid:73) Brain imaging allows us to see which areas are involved in

normal functioning

(cid:73) Brain imaging has the prospect of being used to constrain

models of cognitive processing

Colloquium Announcement

e Prof. Dr. Jochen Triesch  Johanna Quandt Research Professor for Theoretical Life Sciences  Senior Fellow, Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies J. W. Goethe University, Frankfurt  Active efficient coding Cognitive Science IKW Colloquium Abstract The goal of perceptual systems is to provide useful knowledge about the environment and to encode this information efficiently. As such, perception is an active process that often involves the movement of sense organs such as the eyes. This active nature of perception has typically been neglected in popular theories describing how nervous systems learn sensory representations. Here we present an approach for intrinsically motivated learning during active perception that treats the learning of sensory representations and the learning of movements of the sense organs in an integrated manner. In this approach, a generative model learns to encode the sensory data while a reinforcement learner directs the sense organs so as to make the generative model work as efficiently as possible. To this end, the reinforcement learner receives an intrinsic reward signal that measures the encoding quality currently obtained by the generative model. In the context of binocular vision, the approach is shown to lead to a self-calibrating stereo vision system that learns a representation for binocular disparity while at the same time learning proper vergence eye movements to fixate objects. The approach is quite general and can be applied to other types of eye movements such as smooth pursuit and may be extended to different sensory modalities. Somewhat surprisingly, the approach also offers a new perspective on the development of imitation abilities. Wednesday, 12 November, 5 pm (sharp) 32/110 Recommended Thinking

(cid:73) In what way is simulating a brain diﬀerent from simulating cognitive processes?
(cid:73) Sebastian Seung gave a TED talk on connectomics. Check it out [Link]. What
would you do with a complete wiring diagram of a brain? How would this help
our understanding of the computations that the brain performs?

(cid:73) Assume you had a realistic model of a whole brain, i.e. all neurons and their
connections, in a computer. Do you need all this detail? Would you want to
also simulate all the molecules inside the cells or the blood vessels and glia cells
around the neurons? What degree of detail do you need to make it a realistic
model of a brain?

(cid:73) Could a realistic model of the brain pass the Turing test? How? Or why not?
(cid:73) Does a lesion in an area that impairs a certain cognitive function really mean

that the function is localized in this brain area? What are alternative
explanations?

(cid:73) Cognition is in the brain. What else does fMRI tell us? What do we learn by

knowing where in the brain something is computed? Can brain imaging help us
ﬁgure out how something is computed?

(cid:73) The public is fascinated by images of brain scans. Do you understand what is

shown on these images or how they were generated?

(cid:73) You’ve probably seen images of brain scans in the media. A recent study has
shown that people are less critical in examining the claims of a study if it is
accompanied by the image of a brain scan [McCabe and Castel, 2008]. Why do
you think this is?

Recommended Reading

An excellent introductory textbook is Cognitive Neuroscience: The Biology of the
Mind [Gazzaniga et al., 1998]. The library has many copies. Most of the topics that
were covered in this lecture are covered in more detail in the ﬁrst three chapters. I
highly recommend reading at least the ﬁrst chapter on the history of cognitive
neuroscience now. The rest will come up in your neurobiology class anyway. The
Action and Cognition lecture also covers many aspects of cognitive neuroscience.
Another standard textbook in neuroscience is Principles of Neural Science
[Kandel et al., 2000]. There are more recent editions for both books. If you are
interested in brain lesions and patient studies an easy and exciting read is The Man
Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat [Sacks, 1998].
