6. What are the main points discussed in Eagleton's 

Criticism and Ideology? (101; Julia)

8. Taking the Marxist dialectical criticism into account, how 

can one explain the statement, “We can never get 
outside our subjective existence in time, but we can 
break through the hardening shell of our ideas 'into a 
more vivd apprehension of reality itself’”?
