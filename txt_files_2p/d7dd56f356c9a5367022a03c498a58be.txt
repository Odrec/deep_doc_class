“Double Consciousness” 
 
W. E. B. Du Bois, The Souls of Black Folk (1903) 
 
It  is  a  peculiar  sensation,  this  double-consciousness,  this  sense  of  always  looking  at  one's  self 
through  the  eyes  of  others,  of  measuring  one's  soul  by  the  tape  of  a  world  that  looks  on  in 
amused contempt and pity. One ever feels his twoness, -- an American, a Negro; two souls, two 
thoughts,  two  unreconciled  strivings;  two  warring  ideals  in  one  dark  body,  whose  dogged 
strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder. 

The  history  of  the  American  Negro  is  the  history  of  this  strife,  --  this  longing  to  attain  self-
conscious  manhood,  to  merge  his  double  self  into  a  better  and  truer  self.  In  this  merging  he 
wishes neither of the older selves to be lost. He would not Africanize America, for America has 
too much to teach the world and Africa. He would not bleach his Negro soul in a flood of white 
Americanism, for he knows that Negro blood has a message for the world. He simply wishes to 
make it possible for a man to be both a Negro and an American, without being cursed and spit 
upon by his fellows, without having the doors of Opportunity closed roughly in his face.
