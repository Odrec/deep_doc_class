REVIEW

Plant hormone receptors: perception
is everything

Brenda Chow1 and Peter McCourt1,2

Despite the bewildering ability of higher plants to
change their development with respect to the environ-
ment, there appear to be only a few hormones that func-
tion to organize growth and development. With the re-
cent identification of three plant hormone receptors, the
molecular identities of all the major plant receptors are
now known. Some plant hormones such as cytokinins,
ethylene, and brassinosteroids (BR) use well-character-
ized signaling modules such as those involving receptor
kinases, but in the case of the ethylene and BR receptors,
there appear to be additional functions aside from the
hormone they perceive. Auxin and gibberellin percep-
tion require unique mechanisms where the receptors are
components involved in ubiquitination-dependent pro-
teolysis. With plant hormone receptors in hand, com-
parisons can now be made between plants and other
kingdoms as to how hormones control growth and de-
velopment.

Multicellular organisms, whether plants or animals, co-
ordinate their growth and development at a tissue and
organ level by using extracellular signaling molecules to
communicate between cells. In animals, these extracel-
lular signals usually take the form of small proteins or
peptides, like insulin, or small organic-based hormone
molecules, such as steroids or retinoids. In the case of
plants, the organic class of hormones has historically
dominated since these molecules influence numerous
aspects of growth and development (Davies 1995). In-
triguingly, although a number of the plant hormone
structures have similar animal counterparts, plant hor-
mones seem to have a much broader range of function
(Fig. 1). A single plant cell can respond to more than one
hormone, while a single hormone can affect different
tissues in different ways. Obviously, any understanding
of how this developmental complexity is initiated by
these simple organic molecules first requires an under-
standing of how they are perceived. Until recently, how-
ever, the molecular properties of plant hormone percep-
tion were fragmentary compared with animal studies

due to the difficulties in biochemical purification of re-
ceptors.

Unlike animal systems, where organs and glands are
discrete, plant development is a continuum of growth
and differentiation in which cells and tissues both pro-
duce and respond to many hormones. Biochemical analy-
sis is further compromised by the cell wall and the
plethora of secondary chemical products that plants syn-
thesize. Fortunately, with the arrival of modern Arabi-
dopsis genetics, mutations were identified that increased
or decreased the response of a whole plant to a particular
hormone. With the mutants in hand, genes could be iso-
lated without the need for sophisticated biochemistry,
and in the past few years, receptors to many of the major
plant hormones have been identified. This has allowed
biochemical studies and has also initiated a comprehen-
sive comparison of how multicellular plants and ani-
mals, which most likely evolved independently, use
similar organic-based hormones to organize develop-
ment.

In this review, because of the strong influence of ge-
netic analysis on plant hormone studies, we have limited
ourselves to receptors where in vivo studies have pro-
vided the reagents for in vitro experiments. We have
focused on five receptors, as a sufficient body of work
exists for these to allow both informed mechanistic con-
clusions and general comparisons to animal counter-
parts. We have not dealt with the recent identification of
a receptor for abscisic acid (ABA) as the role of this re-
ceptor in general ABA signaling is not clear at this time
(Razem et al. 2006). We have also not dwelt on the
subtleties of mutant screens or details of phenotypes as
these topics have been covered in detail by a large num-
ber of excellent reviews. Sufficient information is now
available to allow receptors to be classified with respect
to their biochemical properties rather than by the hor-
mone they perceive. This type of organization allows
comparisons not only between different plant hormone
systems but also, where possible, to receptors in other
kingdoms.

Hormone perception

ability of exogenous cytokinins to cause greening in Ara-
bidopsis plant tissue culture. An insensitive mutant was
isolated, which led to the identification of the mem-
brane-bound two-component input regulator, CRE1 (In-
oue et al. 2001). Subsequently, two close homologs,
AHK2 and AHK3, were also identified (Suzuki et al.
2001; Yamada et al. 2001; Higuchi et al. 2004). All three
gene products have been shown to bind cytokinin and
complement yeast and bacterial two-component mu-
tants in a cytokinin-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). In Ara-
bidopsis, there are five genes that encode HPt proteins,
designated AHPs, and it appears that these intermediates
transmit the membrane perceived cytokinin signal to
the response regulators (ARRs) located in the nucleus
(Hwang and Sheen 2001).

Because a small gene family defines the cytokinin re-
ceptors, it was perhaps not surprising that single loss-of-
function mutations were not lethal and, for the most
part, allowed plants to grow normally (Higuchi et al.
2004). Combinations of double and triple mutations did
expose abnormal developmental phenotypes, but sur-
prisingly, embryogenesis and early seedling patterning
were relatively normal. Although it is possible that other
cytokinin perception systems exist, these results hint
that the traditional view of an essential role for cytoki-
nins in plant growth and development may be exagger-
ated.

The first genes encoding ethylene receptors were also
identified through genetic screens for mutants that did
not respond to hormone application. These studies led to
the classification of five genes (ETR1, ETR2, ERS1, ERS2,
EIN4) that share sequence similarity with those enocod-
ing the two-component input regulators (Bleecker et al.
1988; Chang et al. 1993; Hua et al. 1995; Hua and Mey-
erowitz 1998; Sakai et al. 1998). Heterologous expression
studies in yeast have clearly defined the signal input do-
main that perceives ethylene as a hydrophobic region at
the N terminus of members of the ethylene receptor
family (Chen et al. 2005; O’Malley et al. 2005). However,
unlike the cytokinin story, the transmitter domain has
been more difficult to understand for a variety of reasons.
First, although truncation of the histidine kinase domain
results in the loss of signal output, site-directed muta-
genesis that specifically eliminates kinase activity only
has modest effects on ethylene signaling (Qu and
Schaller 2004). Second, phylogenetic analysis can divide
the ethylene receptors into two subfamilies based on the
presence or absence of conserved subdomains character-
istic for histidine kinases (Fig. 3B). Finally, some receptor
family members contain a C-terminal receiver domain
that may be phosphorylated by the histidine kinase do-
main, but the presence of a receiver domain does not
correlate with the presence of a histidine kinase domain.
However, since gain-of-function mutations in any of the
receptors confer insensitivity to ethylene, it appears that
all five genes can contribute to ethylene signaling. The
dominant nature of these mutations suggests that mu-
tant receptors may interact with wild-type receptors to
transduce the ethylene signal.

As with the cytokinin receptors, individual loss-of-

proteins. This starts when the first component perceives
an input signal to cause an autophosphorylation of a con-
served histidine in the transmitter domain (Fig. 2A). The
signal is then relayed through a phosphotransfer to a con-
served aspartate residue in the receiver domain of the
second component, often called the response regulator.
Two-component regulators were first defined in prokary-
otes, where they are quite prevalent, often representing
up to 1% of the genome (Mizuno 1997). To date, no two-
component regulators have been found in animals; how-
ever, they have been identified in both fungi and plants.
The fungal and plant two-component systems are more
complicated than the canonical prokaryotic system in
that the input histidine kinase domain itself often car-
ries a receiver domain (Fig. 2B). Moreover, an intermedi-
ate, designated HPt for histidine phosphotransfer protein
can also participate in the phosphate transfer between
the histidine kinase and the receiver domain. Three-di-
mensional protein studies show that HPt domains share
similarity with parts of the transmitter domain (Kato et
al. 1997).

In Arabidopsis, eight two-component input regulators
genes have been functionally identified as hormone re-
ceptors (Fig. 3). Three are involved in cytokinin percep-
tion, and five encode ethylene receptors. The first cyto-
kinin receptor was identified by taking advantage of the

system. (A) The two-step system found only
in prokaryotes. The input domain binds a
signal molecule, resulting in the phosphory-
lation (green-encircled P) of a conserved his-

the receiver domain on the response regula-
tor. As a result, the output domain is acti-
vated to transduce the signal. (B) The mul-

function mutations in the ethylene receptor genes
caused little change in plant growth while multiple com-
binations resulted in developmental phenotypes (Hua
and Meyerowitz 1998). However, unlike the cytokinin
response where loss of more receptors decreased cytoki-
nin responsiveness, decreasing the number of functional
ethylene receptors resulted in plants with a constitutive
ethylene response (Hua and Meyerowitz 1998). The most
parsimonious explanation for this result is that the fam-
ily of ethylene receptors normally functions in the ab-
sence of ethylene and that addition of the gas inhibits
this function (Fig. 3B). This model fits well with the
immediate downstream component of the receptors,
CTR1, since this serine/threonine protein kinase is a
negative regulator of the ethylene response in Arabidop-
sis (Kieber et al. 1993). In the absence of ethylene, the
receptors activate CTR1, which in turn suppresses the
ethylene response (Fig. 3B). When ethylene binds the re-
ceptors, CTR1 activation is inhibited, releasing down-
stream components to activate the ethylene pathway.
Protein interaction studies and colocalization of both
ETR1 and CTR1 protein to the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) support the genetic interactions (Clark et al. 1998;
Cancel and Larsen 2002; Chen et al. 2002; Gao et al.
2003). Because specific mutations in CTR1 that disrupt
ETR1–CTR1 interactions cause movement of CTR1 to
the cytosol and genetic removal of two or more ethylene
receptors also results in CTR1 protein redistribution, it
appears that the ethylene receptors act as a scaffolding
protein for CTR1 at the ER (Gao et al. 2003; Huang et al.
2003). Therefore, ethylene receptors are quite unlike cy-
tokinin or other two-component receptors in that there

is no phospho-relay to a typical HPt domain protein or a
response regulator.

The oddities of the ethylene “two-component” recep-
tors also apply to the way ethylene itself interacts with
the receptor. Like other hormone ligands, ethylene is
active at nanomolar concentrations. However, unlike
most hormones, which are generally complex with re-
spect to molecular shape, ethylene simply consists of
two carbons. The lack of multiple contact points be-
tween ethylene and its receptor would not allow for the
many weak interactions that are usually required to
achieve high-affinity ligand–receptor specificity. This
peculiarity was explained by the demonstration that a
copper ion associates with the ethylene receptor and is
required for binding of ethylene in both Arabidopsis and
heterologous yeast systems expressing ETR1 (Schaller
and Bleecker 1995; Rodriguez et al. 1999). Interestingly,
the cyanobacterium Synechocystis strain 6803 contains
an ethylene receptor ortholog, which also requires a cop-
per cofactor to bind ethylene at a high affinity (Rodriguez
et al. 1999). Although Synechocystis does not synthesize
or respond to ethylene, the conservation between bacte-
rial and higher plant genes suggests that the progenitor
to the ethylene receptor in plants was co-opted from a
cyanobacterial ancestor after plant cells acquired the
chloroplast during endosymbiosis.

This model implies that the progenitor ethylene recep-
tor may have evolved to influence an already existing
plant signaling pathway. Models of signaling pathway
evolution have suggested that these pathways evolve in
reverse order from the target transcription factor to the
first step, which is the receptor and ligand combination

Hormone perception

Figure 3. Structural relationships within and between two-component regulators involved in cytokinin and ethylene perception. (A)
In Arabidopsis, three cytokinin receptors (CRE1, AHR2, and AHR3) all bind cytokinins at their extracellular input domain. This
results in a phospho-relay that eventually activates cytokinin responses. AHP and the type-B ARR are the Arabidopsis equivalents of
the Hpt domain and response regulator proteins, respectively. (B) Five ethylene receptors (ETR1, ERS1, ETR2, EIN4, and ERS2) exist
in Arabidopsis that all bind ethylene in their extracellular domain. Various forms of the transmitter domain exist on each receptor so,
in principle, not all receptors can transfer phosphate groups. However, genetic analysis suggests that all of the ethylene receptors
activate their downstream target component (CTR1) in the absence of the gas, and that binding of ethylene to the receptors inhibits
this activation of CTR1.

(Wilkins 1995). Often new components act as neomor-
phic and dominant-negative units that reverse the func-
tion of the previous step. This would appear to hold true
for the upper part of the ethylene signaling pathway in
which CTR1 acts negatively on EIN2, ethylene receptors
act positively on CTR1, and, finally, ethylene acts nega-
tively on the receptors. The idea that the ethylene recep-
tor was a late addition to a pre-existing pathway may
explain the major paradox in ethylene signaling regard-
ing how enhanced sensitivity can occur with a reduction
in receptor number (Cancel and Larsen 2002). The obser-
vation that glucose can enhance the degradation of EIN3,
a key transcriptional regulator at the bottom of the eth-
ylene response pathway, hints that the ethylene pathway
has other modulators (Yanagisawa et al. 2003). If the role
of the bottom of the ethylene response pathway is to
modulate sugar responses, which in turn determines cell
growth and expansion, then the role of ethylene and its
upstream receptor may simply be to inhibit a carbon
response pathway.
Leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-based hormone receptors

In both plants and animals, steroid-based molecules have
been identified that act as hormones for directing growth

and development. In plants, the best described steroid
hormone is brassinosteroid (BR). The first interest in BR
arose from its growth promoting qualities upon applica-
tion. The isolation of Arabidopsis mutants deficient in
BR biosynthesis clearly demonstrated that BR is in fact a
general regulator of plant growth and development (Li et
al. 1996; Szekeres et al. 1996). The identification of mu-
tations affecting BR perception involved screening for
Arabidopsis mutants that showed normal root growth
on exogenous BR or by screening for dwarf mutants that
mimicked BR auxotrophic phenotypes that were not res-
cued by exogenous BR (Clouse et al. 1996; Li and Chory
1997; Noguchi et al. 1999).

In both cases, these approaches uncovered many al-
leles of a single locus, designated BRI1, which encodes a
plasma membrane-associated LRR receptor-like kinase
(LRR-RLK) (Li and Chory 1997). The LRR is a common
protein motif of usually 20–29 residues that is found in a
number of proteins with diverse functions throughout
all kingdoms (Fig. 4A; Kobe and Kajava 2001). Plant re-
ceptors have an extracellular LRR domain that is fused
to an intracellular serine/threonine kinase domain. In
animals, LRR-based receptors transduce their signals
through intracellular protein–protein interactions rather

of four types of LRR receptors found in

than directly through kinase domains. For example, the
activated Toll receptor in Drosophila recruits, among
other proteins, a serine/threonine kinase that shares
similarity to the kinase domain found in plant LRR-
RLKs (Shiu and Bleecker 2001). Interestingly, other ex-
amples exist where plants have fused regulatory domains
into a single protein while the equivalent domains in
animals must associate through protein–protein interac-
tions (Schena and Davis 1994).

The uncovering of a LRR-RLK as having a role in plant
hormone signaling is perhaps not unexpected since this
class of genes constitutes a large family consisting of
>200 genes in the Arabidopsis genome (Shiu and Bleecker
2003). What was unexpected is that the extracellular
LRR module directly binds BR. It is commonly thought
that the LRR motif functions as a protein–protein inter-
action domain rather than as a domain that interacts
with organic molecules (Kobe and Kajava 2001). In the
case of the BRI1 LRR, however, the 25 leucine repeats are
interrupted by a unique 70-amino-acid island domain
(ID) between repeat 21 and 22 (Li and Chory 1997). The
importance of the ID in BR signaling was implied by the
observation that mutations that confer BR insensitivity
cluster to this region and, more directly, by the ability of
BR to bind to the ID in vitro (Li and Chory 1997; Ki-
noshita et al. 2005). Perhaps the ID explains the unique
property of this extracellular domain to bind organic
molecules, and it has been speculated that LRR22-ID
may not fold in a typical way (Kinoshita et al. 2005).

In animals, a superfamily of nuclear receptors exists
that are activated when the fully buried ligand completes

2002

GENES & DEVELOPMENT

the hydrophobic core of the receptor (Bogan et al. 1998).
In this scenario, the ligand acts to stabilize the protein so
that it can become nuclear localized and directly bind
DNA. In plants, it appears that binding of BR to inactive
BRI1 homodimers induces autophosphorylation of its cy-
toplasmic kinase domain and thereby stimulates the in-
teraction of BRI1 with another related LRR-RLK called
BAK1 (Fig. 4B). BAK1 contains a short four-leucine zip-
per repeat extracellular domain with no ID motif so it
appears this LRR-RLK does not bind BR. Two models
have been proposed for BRI1/BAK1 interactions. The
first suggests that BR allows BRI1 and BAK1 to interact,
thereby allowing transphosphorylation of BAK1. A sec-
ond model is that BRI1 and BAK1 form a complex that is
stabilized and activated by BR (Nam and Li 2002). Re-
cently, in vitro analysis suggested that heteromeric as-
sociations between BRI1 and BAK1, as well as phos-
phorylation, are dependent on BR (Wang et al. 2005).
Whatever the case, it appears that plants perceive steroid
hormones at the plasma membrane and eventually
stimulate gene expression through an involved signal
transduction pathway that is similar to Wnt signaling in
animals (Yin et al. 2002).

Binding experiments with BR indicate that it directly
interacts with and activates the BRI1/BAK1 complex;
however, some evidence exists to suggest that the first
stages of signaling may be more complex. First, overex-
pressing the carboxypeptidase BRS1, which normally lo-
calizes to the extracellular space, can suppress a weak
bri1 allele (Li et al. 2001a; Zhou and Li 2005). This sup-
pression, which is specific to BRI1 and requires both BR

and a functional protein kinase domain, indicates that
BRS1 is involved in an early event in BRI1-mediated sig-
naling. The molecular identity of BRS1 suggests that this
protein may be involved in receptor proteolytic process-
ing, and there is evidence that BRI1 may undergo endo-
cytosis after binding BR (Russinova et al. 2004).

Alternatively, BRS1 may be involved in the processing
of an as of yet unidentified protein ligand. The latter idea
gains some support from studies in tomato showing that
the BRI1 homolog is also the receptor for an 18-amino-
acid protein called systemin (Montoya et al. 2002; Scheer
et al. 2003). Systemin is the processed form of an inactive
200-amino-acid preprotein made during insect herbivory
to activate a battery of defense genes (Ryan and Pearce
2003). Tomato bri1 mutants, which are phenotypically
similar to BR-deficient dwarfs, are defective in systemin
signaling. Furthermore, although BR does not reduce sys-
temin binding, it does inhibit the systemin response
(Scheer et al. 2003). It is possible that BR inhibits syste-
min signaling by directing the tomato BRI1 receptor
away from systemin signaling and toward hormone sig-
naling (Fig. 5A). Alternatively, BR and systemin may
function through the same signaling pathway. In Arabi-
dopsis, one function of a BR-bound BRI1 receptor is to
negatively regulate the GSK3/SHAGGY-like kinase,
BIN2 (Li et al. 2001b; Li and Nam 2002). In the absence
of BR, BIN2 negatively regulates activators of BR gene
expression. In tomato, the BRI1 receptor is activated by

systemin, which could influence BIN2 function. In this
case, mutations in BIN2 and other downstream compo-
nents of BR signaling may have altered systemin signal-
ing. Although systemin has only been identified in some
members of the Solanceae family, this observation of a
shared receptor for both a peptide and organic molecule
could mean that BR receptors in other plants may also
have shared perception functions. Multiple recognition
specificity may explain the discrepancy between the
level of BRI protein, which is abundant in all tissues, and
the low levels of BR ligand (Friedrichsen et al. 2000).

Aside from the structural similarities, other intriguing
similarities exist between systemin/BR perception and
signaling in tomato and Toll-based signaling in Dro-
sophila. Like the tomato systemin/BR receptor, the Toll
receptor also has two functions: one in embryogenesis,
and the other in adult immune responses. Early events
also appear to involve a proteolytic processing of an in-
active preprotein to produce the activated Spatzle ligand
that subsequently binds the extracellular LRR domain of
the receptor (Jang et al. 2006). This leads to the recruit-
ment of a serine/threonine kinase, which phosphorylates
downstream components. In the case of the Toll path-
way, however, a single ligand Spatzle is used in both
processes but is cleaved by different developmentally
regulated proteases into its mature form. The processing
of the systemin ligand parallels that of the Toll ligand, as
does the identification of a carboxyl peptidase in BRI1

Figure 5. Consequences of LRR receptor–ligand interactions. (A) In tomato, the BRI1 receptor (tBRI1) can bind either BR or the small
peptide systemin. Systemin is processed from a larger polypeptide by an as of yet uncharacterized protease (curved arrow). The
resulting ligand binds tBRI1, causing heterodimerization of the tBRI1 with an uncharacterized LRR protein (?) to induce defense
responses. Alternatively, if tBRI1 binds BR, this results in a BRI–BAK1 dimerization and BR-dependent growth. (B) InDrosophila , a
protease (curved arrow) cleaves a preprotein to generate a polypeptide Spatzle, which subsequently binds the Toll receptor. The choice
between embryo development and innate immune response is determined by the developmentally regulated cleavage of the pre-Spatzle
protein.

signaling. Although not conserved at the amino acid
level, the Toll receptor also contains an “island” within
the LRR extracellular domains whose functions are un-
known. Perhaps like BRI1, this region can also bind an
organic molecule that modulates its function.

Ubiquitination-based hormone receptors

The first hints that some plant hormones had unique
mechanisms of signaling came from the identification of
genes required for normal responsiveness to exogenous
auxin. Broadly speaking, these genes encoded two classes
of molecules. One comprised members of a family of
extremely shortlived nuclear proteins called Aux/IAAs
(Rouse et al. 1998; Tian and Reed 1999; Nagpal et al.
2000; Rogg et al. 2001; for review, see Reed 2001). Aux/
IAA genes are rapidly induced by auxin application, and
their protein products are then quickly degraded (Abel
and Theologis 1996). Mutations in Aux/IAA genes that
conferred increased resistance to auxin mapped to a com-
mon domain shown to be important in protein stability.
Hence, decreasing the turnover of an Aux/IAA protein
somehow conferred decreased auxin sensitivity. The sec-

ond class of molecules identified various components of
the SCF (Skp1/Cullin/F-box) ubiquitin protein complex
(Ruegger et al. 1998; Gray et al. 1999, 2001).

The SCF complex, which was first identified in yeast,
provides a mechanism by which cells can rapidly degrade
proteins by targeting them to the 26S proteosome (for
review, see Tyers and Jorgensen 2000). Briefly, ubiquitin
is first activated by an E1 enzyme and then passed to a
family of ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzymes (Fig. 6). The
E2 enzyme carrying an ubiquitin molecule can interact
with the Cullin subunit of the SCF complex. The SKP1
subunit acts as an adaptor protein between Cullin and
the F-box so that when the F-box protein captures a pro-
tein target it is now in the vicinity of the E2 enzyme and
can be ubiquinated (Fig. 6). This process is reiterated un-
til the target protein accumulates more than four ubiq-
uitins, which signal it for degradation via the 26S pro-
teosome.

There are other subunits and modifications that influ-
ence SCF function, but the specificity of the F-box pro-
tein in determining target substrate suggested that the
SCF complex is central to the regulation of Aux/IAA
protein levels. An F-box protein, TIR1, which specifi-

related components in the auxin and GA pathways have the same shape. The left panel represents a yeast-type SCF proteolysis model
in which an ubiquitin (⽧) is added to the target protein via a set of reactions. Ubiquitin is activated by an E1 enzyme and conjugated

ubiquitination of the target is a reiterative process, the ubiquitin tail grows and, after reaching a certain length, causes the degradation
of the target via the 20S proteosome. The middle panel depicts auxin-mediated degradation of Aux/IAA repressor targets. The TIR1
F-box protein binds auxin, and this stimulates its association with the Aux/IAA protein. Targeting of Aux/IAA to the proteosome
releases auxin response genes from repression. The modification of the Cullin subunit with the ubiquitin-like protein RUB1 and other
proteins enhances SCF-dependent ubiquitination. The first auxin resistant mutant (arx1) identified a protein required in rubinylation.
The right panel depicts GA-mediated degradation of the DELLA domain repressor targets. The GID1 protein binds the DELLA protein
in a GA-dependent manner and targets it to the SCFGID2 complex for ubiquitination. Degradation of the DELLA domain proteins
releases GA-dependent genes from repression.

cally targets the Aux/IAA proteins for proteolysis, was
identified in a screen for resistance to auxin transport
inhibitors, and subsequent analysis suggested it was an
essential component of auxin responsiveness (Ruegger et
al. 1998). The SCFTIR1 complex was shown to bind Aux/
IAA proteins directly, and this binding was enhanced in
a cell free assay by the addition of auxin (Gray et al. 2001;
Dharmasiri et al. 2003; Kepinski and Leyser 2004). Fi-
nally, it was shown that TIR1 itself could specifically
bind bioactive auxin, and this resulted in an increased
affinity for Aux/IAA proteins (Dharmasiri et al. 2005a;
Kepinski and Leyser 2005). Thus TIR1 is an auxin recep-
tor, and unlike most F-box substrate interactions, this
F-box protein can be directly modified by a small organic
molecule (Fig. 6).

Although Aux/IAA proteins are turned over in an
auxin-dependent manner, these proteins do not bind
DNA but heterodimerize with a related family of auxin
response factor proteins (ARFs) that do bind DNA (Kim
et al. 1997; Ulmasov et al. 1997). These findings led to a
model suggesting that Aux/IAA proteins act as repres-
sors of ARF-mediated transcription and that auxin acti-
vates the SCFTIR1 complex to specifically degrade these
repressors to allow ARF-dependent auxin responses.
Strong support for this model came from knockout com-
binations of all four TIR1-related auxin receptor genes
that not only caused severe loss of auxin responsiveness
but also phenocopied many of the auxin related devel-
opmental defects seen in ARF loss-of-function mutants
(Dharmasiri et al. 2005b).

The ∼700 F-box proteins predicted to be encoded by
the Arabidopsis genome is roughly one order of magni-
tude more than the number found in fungi and animals.
This begs the question as to whether any other F-box
proteins function as receptors for other plant hormones.
One of the best candidates was an F-box protein involved
in GA signaling. In both rice and Arabidopsis, loss-of-
function mutations in GID2 and SLY1, respectively, re-
sult in reduced GA responsiveness, and both genes en-
code related F-box proteins (Steber et al. 1998; McGinnis
et al. 2003; Sasaki et al. 2003). These F-box proteins ap-
pear to target a family of proteins that normally function
to repress GA-related processes (Fig. 6; Peng et al. 1997;
Silverstone et al. 1998; Dill et al. 2001; Itoh et al. 2002).
Because the addition of GA causes these proteins to be
degraded and thereby activates GA-dependent gene ex-
pression, the GA system has many similarities to the
components involved in auxin signaling. This led to sug-
gestions that perhaps GID2/SLY1 F-boxes could be GA
receptors. However, a loss-of-function mutation in a rice
gene encoding a protein with similarity to animal hor-
mone lipases (GID1) was also identified, and this muta-
tion caused both a reduction in GA responsiveness and
prevented the degradation of the DELLA domain repres-
sor protein SLR1 (Ueguchi-Tanaka et al. 2005). More im-
portantly, GID1 specifically bound bioactive GA, and its
ability to bind 17 SLR1 in a yeast two-hybrid assay was
GA dependent (Ueguchi-Tanaka et al. 2005). Hence, the
addition of GA results in a protein–protein interaction
between GID1 and the SLR1 DELLA domain protein to

Hormone perception

cause the degradation of this negative regulator of the
GA response (Fig. 6). The GID1 protein has no detectable
lipase activity but is soluble and localizes to the nucleus
where DELLA domain proteins reside. Interestingly,
members of the TIR1 family of proteins also show
nuclear localization, which raises questions of where
these receptors encounter their hormones and whether
the hormone influences receptor localization.

The identification of the SCF complexes and protein
turnover as central to early auxin and GA signaling
events suggests that the proteolysis of repressor proteins
is an important hormone signal transduction mecha-
nism in plants. However, unlike most epigenetic signal-
ing events, such as a phosphotransfer, proteolysis is ir-
reversible and therefore enforces directionality on a sys-
tem. Such directionality is important in decisions that
require total commitments such as controlling the cell
cycle (Patton et al. 1998). By analogy, it could be argued
that changes in levels of hormones such as auxin and GA
during plant development should be followed by irre-
versible developmental commitments to processes such
as cell division and expansion.

With respect to plant hormone signaling, the auxin
and GA receptors are unique in that the number of com-
ponents between the hormone ligand and the transcrip-
tional factors they control is very small. Depending on
the process being regulated, the length of the signaling
pathway should reflect the required balance between the
speed and robustness of a simple pathway versus the
noise buffering ability of a more complex pathway. Buff-
ering occurs because the addition of signaling compo-
nents creates opportunities for loops to form that can
enhance robustness while reducing signaling noise
(Brandman et al. 2005). Hence, auxin and GA signaling
should be very fast but with less buffering capacity than
ethylene, BR, and cytokinin signaling. This modeling in-
formation should be useful when mapped onto the dif-
ferent physiological and developmental processes that
these hormones influence.

Hormone reception and plant development

By definition, a hormone receptor should be able to rec-
ognize subtle structural differences between small mol-
ecules in a highly specific manner. Binding of the hor-
mone to the receptor should be noncovalent and revers-
ible and result in an activated complex that induces the
primary hormone response. Certainly, the plant hor-
mone receptors reviewed here fulfill many of these cri-
teria, and in the cases of ethylene, cytokinin, and BR
perception, the classic modules of receptor kinases have
been identified. Having the receptors in hand has al-
lowed comparison to each other as well as to those in
other systems. For example, ethylene interferes with its
two-component receptor function, whereas the cytoki-
nin two-component receptor acts through the archetypal
mechanism of activation and phosphotransfer to a re-
sponse regulator. The ethylene two-component kinase
does not signal to a canonical response regulator, and its
negative regulation of receptor function suggests the re-

ceptor has other functions in the absence of the hor-
mone. In tomato, the BR receptor is not specific but is
shared with another signaling pathway. Although the ex-
tracellular domain of BRI1 resembles the classic LRR–
protein interaction motif, it has the capacity to bind an
organic molecule through a novel embedded domain.
Presumably the extracellular LRR originally served as a
protein ligand receptor and the addition of the BR-bind-
ing ID domain arose secondarily.

These observations suggest that hormone receptors
like those involving ethylene and BR signaling have ad-
ditional functions that the hormones influence. Auxin
and GA perception use a unique SCF-based proteolysis
mechanism that takes advantage of F-box specificity for
target proteins. However, in the case of GA-dependent
targets, different hormones and environmental stresses
such as salt can also influence target stability (Achard
et al. 2003, 2006; Fu and Harberd 2003). The use of SCF-
based proteolysis as a mechanism of signaling creates
potential nodes of interactions between signaling mol-
ecules. For example, specific mutations that conferred
auxin insensitivity and mapped to a Cullin subunit also
altered jasmonate sensitivity by attenuating the assem-
bly of the jasmonate specific F-box protein COI1 into the
SCF complex (Ren et al. 2005).

These molecular mechanisms of hormone perception
are now beginning to explain how these small enigmatic
molecules can coordinate plant growth and develop-
ment. Plant hormones have never had a clear location of
synthesis and appear to cause a myriad of responses. For
these reasons the role of hormones as “limiting factors”
whose levels control a particular developmental path-
way has never resonated well and has led to arguments
that these small molecules actually function more as
cofactors in balancing the different reactions and meta-
bolic pathways comprising the overall network driving
development (Trewavas 1986). The non-Euclidian pat-
terns of connectivity in a network not only buffer a sys-
tem but also lead to the capacity to produce the same
output via different strategies, which fits well with plant
hormone phenomena. In this respect, that the loss of
hormone perception does not generally result in overall
lethality or even a reduction of cell types also supports
the notion that hormones modulate rather than limit
particular processes. Being perceived by proteins that
have additional functions, or acting at central nodes of
signaling, partly supports a modulating versus control
and command scenario for plant hormone function.

Whatever the case, it is clear there are differences be-
tween how plants and animals use organic-based hor-
mones to organize tissues and organs. Unlike animals,
plants are essentially an amalgamation of loosely depen-
dent units that do not require highly centralized centers
to coordinate growth and development. Because of this,
different parts of a plant can experience different local
environments and respond somewhat independently.
Consequently, rather than having specific organs that
make and respond to particular hormones, each indepen-
dent unit produces and responds to many signals. By act-
ing as factors that bind with high specificity to proteins

with additional roles in development, plant hormones
can add flexibility to signaling pathways that underlie
the plasticity of development seen in higher plants.
