Questions

Q1:   In basal ganglia two major pathways, the direct and the indirect, can be 
found.  What happens if either one is damaged?
Q2:   Which defect is thought to cause Parkinson? Explain the malfunction on  
the basis of the basal ganglia circuit.

Name input and output areas as well as relations of activation and inhibition 
between the different areas. 
Q6:   Describe the three cardinal symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. 
Q7:   Describe the “gold standard” therapy of Parkinson’s disease and why it 
works. Name shortly 2 experimental new approaches.
Q8:   Compare lesions and symptoms of Morbus Parkinson and Chorea 
Huntington.

Proposed structure

Please  note  that  the 
numbers  do  not  add  up 
to 100%. We do not know 
the  fibres  of  origin  of  a 
substantial  number  of 
synapses. 

There are two camps with opposite proposals how 
orientation selectivity emerges in V1. First it could be 
dominated  by  the  input  (for  some  reason  highly 
active  and  effective  synapses  of  the  afferents). 
Second,  cortex  could  act  like  an  amplifier 
(magnifying small imbalances in the input).

areas this is no longer true. Here one histological area (e.g. area 6) contains 
several motor areas.

sequence, when a stimulus of 
a given class, such as an object 
is repeated (Row B), there is 
reduction of BOLD related

effects apply for different 
types of objects (Row C). The 
prediction is that different 
areas will show RS effects for 
outcomes of actions (Row D,

Grafton & de C Hamilton (2007) Human Movement Science

Data are adapted from three separate RS experiments. Repetition effects for low-level kinematics, such as hand trajectory, grip size and 
object movement are localized to visual association cortex including inferior occipital cortex and the posterior superior parietal cortex 
(parietal reach region). RS for object-centered goals strongly modulates the anterior intraparietal sulcus and left ventral premotor cortex. 
Sensitivity to the outcome of an action overlaps to a certain degree with goal-object areas, but also strongly modulates activity in bilateral 
inferior parietal lobule and right ventral premotor cortex. 

The motor system might be organized in a hierarchical manner,  
matching a decomposition of action complexes.

M1 in a monkey

In anesthetized monkey, a 
microelectrode is 
positioned closed to layer V. 
Low current stimulation is 
delivered to excite ~30 
pyramidal neurons. Flick-
like twitches of discrete 
parts of the contralateral 
side of the body are 
observed. There is a 
general trend for 
somatotopy: trunk more 
medial, jaw more lateral. 
However, movement of a 
given body part (e.g., digits) 
is evoked from multiple 
foci.  

On a microscopic scale the map is not ordered.

Activation patterns in the motor system:  
 

The homunculus

Muscles related to movement 
or tactile sensing of different 
body parts are systematically 
located in M1 and S1. This is 
called the homunculus. The 
amount of cortical tissue 
does not match the size of 
the respective body parts. 
Regions important for fine 
manipulations, e.g. hands, 
fingers and lips are vastly 
overrepresented.

over whether “muscles” or “movements” are
represented in the primary motor cortex (M1)
(1). From a contemporary perspective, this
question can be recast: What aspects of
movement are encoded in the activity of M1
neurons: relatively low-level movement pa-
rameters like muscle force, or more abstract
movement parameters like handpath? Since
the pioneering work of Evarts (2), this ques-
tion has been examined by recording the
activity of single neurons in awake trained
primates [for example, (3–10)]. Early exper-
iments examined M1 activity in relation to
simple finger and wrist movements (3). The
discharge of many M1 neurons in these stud-
ies covaried with movement parameters such
as static and dynamic force. These results led
to the view that M1 is concerned with the
generation of movement in terms of an “in-
trinsic” parameter space related to one or
more of a number of variables including as-
pects of joint kinematics, joint torques, and
the detailed pattern of muscle activity at a
single joint.

A different perspective has come from
studies of M1 activity during reaching move-
ments (4). In some experiments, the activity
of M1 neurons, as a population, covaried with
the trajectory of hand movement and signaled
its instantaneous movement direction and ve-
locity. These and similar results led to the
view that M1 is concerned with the genera-
tion of movement in terms of an “extrinsic”

Movement direction

Motor Cortex

Shinji Kakei,1 Donna S. Hoffman,1,3 Peter L. Strick1,2,3*

What aspects of movement are represented in the primary motor cortex (M1):
relatively low-level parameters like muscle force, or more abstract parameters
like handpath? To examine this issue, the activity of neurons in M1 was recorded
in a monkey trained to perform a task that dissociates three major variables
of wrist movement: muscle activity, direction of movement at the wrist joint,
and direction of movement in space. A substantial group of neurons in M1 (28
out of 88) displayed changes in activity that were muscle-like. Unexpectedly,
an even larger group of neurons in M1 (44 out of 88) displayed changes in
activity that were related to the direction of wrist movement in space inde-
pendent of the pattern of muscle activity that generated the movement. Thus,
both “muscles” and “movements” appear to be strongly represented in M1.

ined the patterns of muscle activity associ-
ated with performance of the task. We re-
corded the activity of 27 muscles in the
forearm, upper arm, and shoulder (14–16 ).
Only four wrist muscles and three finger
muscles (17 ) were active before movement
onset in all three postures. These muscles
displayed phasic agonist bursts whose am-
plitudes varied for different directions of
movement. The variation in amplitude for
each muscle was well fit by a cosine func-
tion (18). We determined the preferred di-

and then from Mid to Sup, the PDs of all
seven muscles rotated clockwise as well.
The shift in the PD for individual muscles
was always less than 90° for the full 180°

in a muscle- or jointlike coordinate frame will
have PDs that shift 46° to 90° (muscle) or
180° ( joint) when wrist movements are made
with the forelimb in different postures. On the
other hand, neurons signaling information in
an extrinsic-like coordinate frame will have
PDs that are relatively stable under the same
task conditions. Therefore, to determine the
coordinate frame for M1 neurons, we record-
ed the activity of single neurons in M1 while
a monkey performed our task (20–22). We
found 125 neurons in the hand area of M1
that displayed movement-related activity. Of
these, 88 had directionally tuned (23) activity
in all three wrist postures. These neurons are
the subject of this report.

We calculated the PD of each direction-
ally tuned neuron for the three separate pos-
tures (18, 24). This allowed us to determine
the shift in PD for the 180° clockwise rotation
from the Pro to Mid to Sup postures. On the
basis of this analysis, the 88 directionally
tuned neurons formed three groups. One

Coordinate transformations

Kakei et al. (2001) Nature Neurosci

Alexander and Crutcher have described a model as “a 
sequence of computations that successively determine 
1)  the  location  of  the  target  in  space,  2)  the  hand 
trajectory  needed  to  acquire  the  target,  3)  the  joint 
kinematics  needed  to  achieve  the  trajectory  (inverse 
kinematics), 4) the joint torques needed to satisfy the 
kinematic  constraints  (inverse  dynamics)  and  5)  the 
patterns  of  effector  (‘muscle’)  activation  needed  to 
satisfy  the  required  dynamics.” This  sounds  plausible, 
but is that so?

A  sequence  of  coordinate  transformation  occurs  in 
the  motor  pathway.  In  premotor  cortex  we  observe 
spatial  coordinates.  Most  probably  body  centred,  not 
truly  allocentric  (but  who  knows!?).  In  M1  the 
population  is  mixed. The  muscles,  well,  are  in  muscle 
space.  No  neurons  coding  joint  angles  are  observed. 
Many  of  the  neurons  in  the  premotor  cortex  have 
additionally tactile and visual receptive ﬁelds. How do 
these change with movements?

There is a continuous shift from extrinsic space to muscle space.  
Neurons coding in joint space are rare. 

Questions

Q1:    What can be said about the match of histological divisions and functional divisions 
in primary cortical areas and higher ones?

Q2:    What purpose serves supplementary motor area (SMA)? Describe also where it is 
located and where it gets its input from and where it projects to, respectively.

Q3:    Make a list of motor areas (at least 4) and where they are found in the frontal lobe.

Q4:    What are the acute and chronic symptoms of lesions of upper and lower motor 
neurons respectively? 

Q5:    Describe the topographic arrangement of neurons in primary motor and primary 
sensorimotor cortex with respect to movement and receptive fields.

Q6:    What is understood by the term “homunculus”?

Q7:    What is the difference between population coding and averaging over trials?

Q8:    How do you get optimal direction of neurons in M1?

Q9:    How could a movement performed by a subject read out of the activities of 
neurons in primary motor cortex. State the algorithm to compute a population vector.
