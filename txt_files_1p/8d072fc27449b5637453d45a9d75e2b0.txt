Super-diversity and its implications

Steven Vertovec

Abstract

Diversity in Britain is not what it used to be. Some thirty years of
government policies, social service practices and public perceptions have
been framed by a particular understanding of immigration and multi-
cultural diversity. That is, Britain’s immigrant and ethnic minority
population has conventionally been characterized by large, well-organized
African-Caribbean and South Asian communities of citizens originally
from Commonwealth countries or formerly colonial territories. Policy
frameworks and public understanding  and, indeed, many areas of social
science  have not caught up with recently emergent demographic and
social patterns. Britain can now be characterized by ‘super-diversity,’ a
notion intended to underline a level and kind of complexity surpassing
anything the country has previously experienced. Such a condition is
distinguished by a dynamic interplay of variables among an increased
number of new, small and scattered, multiple-origin, transnationally
connected, socio-economically differentiated and legally stratified immi-
grants who have arrived over the last decade. Outlined here, new patterns of
super-diversity pose significant challenges for both policy and research.

Keywords: Diversity; multiculturalism; immigration; United Kingdom; London.

Livingstone stated that in London ‘you see the world gathered in one
city, living in harmony, as an example to all’ (in Freedland 2005). The
‘world in one city’ idea was also the title of a special section in the
Guardian newspaper celebrating ‘the most cosmopolitan place on
earth’ where ‘Never have so many different kinds of people tried living
together in the same place before’ (Benedictus and Godwin 2005, p. 2).
The ‘world in one city’ was the title of the Greater London Authority’s
analysis of the 2001 Census (GLA 2005a), too, which examined the
presence of people from 179 nations within the capital. The successful
