The problems of generalisation and decision making in research
•

limits of generalisation from any data by sampling methods and statistical significance 
testing 
generalisation is an aspect of decision making by the researcher

•
• main issues:

◦ rules of thumb for the decision-making process distort the reality of research
◦ it is not simply a matter of failing to find support for a hypothesis in a particular 

study but a decisionmaking process based not simply on basic statistical outcomes 
but on a finer judgement as to whether the hypothesis had been given a fair chance in
the research study.

Universalism
•

assumptions imply to be universal “laws of human behavior” but they are viewpoint 
dependent
e.g. social status, cultural differences

Sampling  and generalisation
•
•

sampling methods of participants are only part of the problem
introspectionism (research at researcher as participant) was replaced by behaviourism in 
the 20th century
single case studies for rare cases = applying the independent variable at different random
points in time
ideal sample size: precision against variability 
differences for study purpose (medical, training, pilot, etc)
for averaging values with low error margin: more participants=better precision
to find out relations/correlation fewer participants suffice
convenience sample: (easy to get, e.g. students) acceptable for finding a relation
however the representativeness is discussed, dependent on research subject
difference between population of interest and sample
participant rates can be very low
random selection does not necessarily result in a random sample

Statistics and generalisation
•
•

crucial: significant testing and size of trend,relationship,..
significant testing can overlook trends or make appear trends where there are none
