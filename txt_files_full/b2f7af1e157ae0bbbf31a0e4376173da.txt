Current approaches in CAC (Computer-Aided Composition)

◦ Building musical objects by connecting components 

through different construction tools

◦ 2 types: 

▫ Time-lined Sequencers
▫ Advanced Programming Languages and Libraries

In favor → Control all dimensions of the work

Against → Fine understanding of technicalities requirement

Introduction

Examples

Introduction

Solutions? → Alternative Systems
◦ Attempt to escape from technical requirements

Elody (Letz, Orlarey, and Fober 1998) 
◦ Arbitrary abstractions creation by selecting 
musical material and dimension of the music 
◦ Con → user must keep in mind a model of the 

abstraction algorithm at work 

Introduction

Melody Morphing Method (Hamanaka et al. 2008) 
◦ Based on GTTM (Generative Theory of Tonal Music)
◦ Melodies created as interpolations between two given 

melodies

◦ Con: Limited by GTTM, arbitrary categories not applicable

Introduction

Description-based design

Successor

The Continuator

Goal
◦ Creating simple musical objects (unaccompanied 

melodies)

▫ Remove the need of technical requirements

Introduction

How does DBDM work?
1. Randomly object generation by the system
2. Tagging of the objects using words
3. Selection of starting object and a previous tag
4. Asking the system to produce a “closer” object to the 

selected by choosing more or less of the tag

5. Addition of the new new object to the system palette 

Melody categories

5 Melody Types

Tonal
Have a clear tonal center

Brown
Only small intervalls

Serial
All pitches occur with equal 
frequency

Long/Short
Depended on the number of 
notes

Sample sequences

(a) - tonal
(b) - serial
(c) - brown

Tagging

Description-Based Design Approach

Phase 1:
Objects (Melodies) are created

(either randomly or according to specific generators)

User tags melodies with one or more words 
(for example “dissonant”, “harmonic”, “jumpy”)

Phase 2:

User selects a starting object and a tag

(for example “more jumpy”)

The system then produces an object that satisfies being 
“close” to the starting object while increasing the 
probability of the new object to belong to the specified 
tag

Object Generator

Technical features that describe objects (feature space):
◦ Number of Notes
◦ Mean value of the pitch sequence
◦ Mean value of the “pitch interval” sequemce
◦ Mean value of the velocity (MIDI information)
◦ Tonal weight (Indication of tonality, “pitch profile” 

algorithm)

◦ Pitch compressability ratio (Measure of repetition)
◦

Interval compressability ratio 

Objects (MIDI files) are generated either randomly or with 
specific generators

Feature selection algorithm

Feature selection algorithm:

Information Gain Ratio 
-> selects most informative features for each class

A Machine Learning Tagging System

Support Vector Machine (SVM)
◦ Binary classifier
◦ Builds optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between 

classes

◦ New objects are classified according to geometrical distance
◦ Classes are recomputed after each tagging
◦ Classifier yields a probability (Inverse of the distance)
◦ Accuracy depends on feature set and number of training 

examples

A Machine Learning Tagging System

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

A Combinatorial Generator

Maximize:

Increase/Decrease probability to belong to a class/tag:

Usage of SVM-class propabilities

Closeness to initial object:

SVM-distances between objects not meaningful

Use domain dependent differences instead

Possible extension via compound commands:

For example “less tonal AND more long”

The Experiment

Prerequisites

◦ For each category, 72 samples 

are created

◦ Accomplished by generators, 

according to the tags

◦ Sequences of 0-16 notes 

randomly created

Generators

Tonal

Serial

Brown

Random notes 
from a random 
scale

Random pitch 
from initial list of 
all pitches
If list is empty, it 
is refilled

Random pitch, 
next note 
randomly drawn 
from [-1,+1] 
intervall

Ex
C - major

Ex
The 12 tone scale

Ex
C - C# - D - C#

Variation generator

◦ Variation added by using a 

variation generator

◦ Randomly:

- modify pitch of a random note
- insert a random note
- remove a random note

◦ Result is stored with its features

Training

◦ Examples are generated 
◦ Classifiers trained with 

examples and tags:

- 72 positive and negative
- negative examples -> 
  random sequences from other
  category

‘Tonalizing’ a serial melody

First experiment: 
Making a serial sequence more tonal

Concept:
◦ Classifier selects non - tonal notes
◦ Replaces them with tonal notes
◦ Result: Higher probability of the 

sequence being tonal

◦ Command:
More tonal

‘Tonalizing’ a serial melody

Initial probability:  5.7 %

‘Tonalizing’ a serial melody

In B - flat major, this melody is now 
perfectly tonal!

Final probability of being tonal:
96 %

Stretching a tonal melody

◦ Stretching a tonal melody
-> Adding more notes to it

◦ Long and short features are 

used

◦ Command: 
more long

Stretching a tonal melody

Stretching a tonal melody

◦ Stretching a tonal melody while 

keeping tonality

-> Adding more notes to it
-> keeping the scale

◦ Command: 

more long AND as tonal

Discussion

Further Development plan (Discussion) from the author

◦ Decision tree can substitute SVM.
◦ GA is often used for creating Variations 

but more difficult to control.

◦ This system can be used for analyzing 

chord, chord progression, and 
harmonized melody.

◦ Tone color tagging with FM synthesize 

would be applied in this scheme.

Criticism & Discussion

◦ The evaluation of the tags used for the 

experiments can be also be 
deterministically defined without 
training.

◦ The tags for experiments was too simple 

to say capability of this tool.

◦ How much extent did the authors take 

into account knowledge of one of music 
form : Theme and its Variations?
