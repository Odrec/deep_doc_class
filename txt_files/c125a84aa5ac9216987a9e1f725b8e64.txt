The wife issued a claim for ancillary relief under section 23 of the Matrimonial
Causes Act 19731 against her husband, who was the sole owner of a number of
complexly structured o›shore companies. The wife alleged that the husband had
used the companies to hold legal title to properties which belonged beneÞcially to
him. However, the husband failed to comply with orders for the full and frank
disclosure of his Þnancial position and the companies, which were joined as parties to
the proceedings, failed to Þle a defence or to comply with orders for disclosure. The
judge rejected the wifeÕs submission that the husband had been guilty of any
impropriety in relation to the companies such as would ordinarily entitle the court to
pierce the corporate veil, but held that, in matrimonial proceedings for ancillary relief,
section 24(1)(a) of the 1973 Act conferred a wider jurisdiction to pierce the corporate
veil. The judge concluded that, since the husband had the practical ability to procure
the transfer of the properties, he was ÔÔentitledÕÕ to them within the meaning of
section 24(1)(a), giving the court jurisdiction to make a transfer order in respect of
them. Accordingly, he ordered the husband to transfer or cause to be transferred to
the wife six properties and an interest in a seventh which were held in the name of two
of the husbandÕs companies. The Court of Appeal by a majority allowed an appeal by
the companies, holding that the Family DivisionÕs practice of treating the assets of
companies substantially owned by one party to the marriage as available for
distribution under section 24(1)(a) was beyond the jurisdiction of the court unless the
corporate personality of the company was being abused for a purpose which was in
some relevant respect improper or, on the particular facts, it could be shown that an
asset legally owned by the company was held in trust for the husband and that, since
the judge had rejected both of those possibilities, he ought not to have made the order.

On the wifeÕs appealÑ
Held, (1) that the recognition of a limited power to pierce the corporate veil and
to disregard the separate personality of a company in carefully deÞned circumstances

was necessary if the law were not to be disarmed in the face of abuse and, provided
that the limits were recognised and respected, it was consistent with the general
approach of English law to the problems raised by the use of legal concepts to defeat
mandatory rules of law; that, therefore, if a person were under an existing legal
obligation or liability or subject to an existing legal restriction which he deliberately
evaded or the enforcement of which he deliberately frustrated by interposing a
company under his control, the court could pierce the corporate veil for the purpose,
and only for the purpose, of depriving that company or its controller of the advantage
which they would otherwise have obtained by the companyÕs separate legal
personality; but that the legal interest in the disputed properties was vested in the
companies and, whatever the husbandÕs reasons for organising matters in that way,
there was no evidence that he was seeking to avoid any obligation which was relevant
in the present proceedings; and that, accordingly, there was no justiÞcation as a
matter of general legal principle for piercing the corporate veils of the companies
(post, Supreme Court judgments, paras 27, 35—36, 57—58, 61, 80—82, 96, 97, 103,
104).

1 WLR 832, Gencor ACP Ltd v Dalby [2000] 2 BCLC 734 and Trustor AB v
Smallbone (No 2) [2001] 1 WLR 1177 considered.

(2) That, where there was no justiÞcation as a matter of general legal principle for
piercing the corporate veil, no special and wider principle applied in matrimonial
proceedings by virtue of section 24(1)(a) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973; that
section 24(1)(a) invoked concepts of the law of property, with an established legal
meaning and recognised legal incidents under the general law, which could not be
suspended or mean something di›erent in matrimonial proceedings; that there was
nothing in the 1973 Act, or in its purpose or broader social context, to indicate that
the legislature had intended to authorise the transfer by one party to the marriage to
the other of property which was not his to transfer; that such a transfer would
ordinarily be unnecessary for the purpose of achieving a fair distribution of the assets
of the marriage since, if assets belonged to a company owned by one party to the
marriage, the proper claims of the other could ordinarily be satisÞed by directing the
transfer of shares and, so far as a party deliberately attempted to frustrate the exercise
of the courtÕs ancillary powers by disposing of assets, section 37 of the Act provided
for the setting aside of those dispositions in certain circumstances; that the
recognition of a jurisdiction such as the judge had sought to exercise would cut across
the statutory schemes of company and insolvency law, which were essential for the
protection of those dealing with a company; and that, accordingly, section 24(1)(a)
did not give the judge power to order the husband to transfer to the wife property to
which he was not in law entitled (post, Supreme Court judgments, paras 37—41,
57—58, 86, 88—89, 96, 97, 103, 104).

But, (3) allowing the appeal, that the companies could be ordered to convey the
seven disputed properties to the wife under section 24(1)(a) of the 1973 Act if the
properties belonged beneÞcially to the husband by virtue of
the particular
circumstances in which they had come to be vested in the companies; that that issue
required an examination of evidence which, almost entirely due to the husbandÕs
persistent obstruction and mendacity, was incomplete and in critical respects
obscure; that in claims for ancillary relief in matrimonial proceedings, which had a
substantial inquisitorial element, judges were entitled to draw on their experience
and to take notice of
the inherent probabilities when deciding what an
uncommunicative spouse was likely to be concealing; that the wife had expressly
alleged that the husband had used the companies to hold legal title to properties
which belonged beneÞcially to him and the judgeÕs Þndings about the ownership
and control of the companies meant that the companiesÕ refusal to co-operate with
the proceedings was a course ultimately adopted on the direction of the husband;
that it was a fair inference that the main, if not the only, reason for the companiesÕ
failure to co-operate was to protect the seven properties, which in turn suggested
