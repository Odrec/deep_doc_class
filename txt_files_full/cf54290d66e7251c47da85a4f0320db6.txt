timeHistorical background: Britain in the 1990s (1)

• Recollection of 1960s redefining social norms
• Victory of Thatcherism established economic liberalism; then followed by social 

liberalism

• The Royal Family, church, Westminster and the institution of marriage were all 

weakened

• Artists and entertainers abandoned politics because of its failure to provide a 

working alternative to Thatcherism

• British fashion, comedy and pop music were anti-establishment
• “Britain had come to terms with its new role as a messy, muddled collection of 

peoples, united only by a lack of unity, by a desire to avoid causing too much 
offence to anyone else and by a rapidly declining interest in the country’s history.” 
(Alwyn Turner)

Historical background: Britain in the 1990s (2)

• Sir John Major as well as his successor Tony Blair promised Britain a ‘classless society’, 

but instead created a meritocracy controlled by the elite

• British culture was seen as being in decline as the U.K. emerged to be a global financial 

center and one of the world’s headquarters of capitalism  ‘repackaging of Britannia’

• Tony Blair saw himself as a modernizer, yet failed to radicalize a society “bent out of 

shape by Thatcherite greed and the entrenched privilege of elites” (Alwyn Turner)

• More economic inequality than ever before, yet movement towards a cultural 

classlessness  already existed in the 80s, but much more difficult because of economic, 
social and industrial conflict

• Labour Party government back then very much in favor of the wealthy

• Growing disconnection between political class and public, rise of the believe that 

regardless of electoral outcome, politicians are merely puppets of economic leaders

Historical background: Britain in the 1990s (3)

• Essential negation of democracy and failure to provide real change
• Social media rose and newspaper industry declined (failed to realize the 

competition)

• 90s were a celebration but also a requiem for British culture, “pulling all 

together in a big party before selling it off to the global market place” 
(Alwyn Turner)  

• Last decade in which being British was unique and distinctive
• Great profits for elites and low wages for everybody else work as the 

cultural leveler (to this day)
