Main experimental evidences and theoretical models, currently used
to describe the modiﬁcation of dielectric materials by swift-heavy ion
(SHI) beams, operating in the electronic stopping regime, are
reviewed. The emphasis is on the interplay and synergy between
point defects and amorphous tracks. This implies a change of focus
from purely thermal approaches to those based on the generation
and accumulation of irradiation-induced defects followed by some
type of lattice collapse and structural change. To that end special
attention has been paid to experiments performed at electronic
stopping powers around the threshold value for track formation. In
particular, approaches based on the non-radiative decay of self-
trapped excitons (STEs) have been more extensively discussed. The
discussion is illustrated by dealing in some detail a few speciﬁc
materials such as alkali halides (NaCl), SiO2 and LiNbO3 where STEs
are, or very likely, ascertained. The review stresses the connection
between the SHI-induced effects and those caused by femtosecond
laser pulse irradiations. Moreover, electronic effects on SiO2 materials
are discussed due to their technological relevance and because they
offer an example of the interplay between thermal and excitonic
effects. Finally,
irradiation for various
technologies, with particular emphasis on photonics, is discussed.
