Criteria of ethical reasoning 
revisited 

 Ethical evaluation may be expressed with 

respect to  





(1) character and/or motives of a person (or a group of persons)  
(2) inherent quality/characteristics of an action or a class of actions 

 (3) expected consequences of an action 

or a class of actions.

Different approaches compared 

Ethical evaluation is  
expressed with respect to ... 

(1) inherent quality of an 
action 

(3) Consequences 

or (2) character or motives of 
a person or 

Approach is usually denoted 
as ... 

Deontology (Greek to déon: 
duty) 

Consequentialism 

or as ... (terms originally 
coined by Max Weber) 

Ethics of conviction 
(Gesinnungsethik) 

Ethics of responsibility 
(Verantwortungsethik)

5.3 Utilitarianism 
Jeremy Bentham (1748 – 1832) 

 “Nature has placed mankind 
under the governance of two 
sovereign masters, pain and 
pleasure.“ 

 J. Bentham (1789): Introduction to 
the Principles of Morals and 
Legislation, p. 1. 

 
 
 
 

John Stuart Mill (1806 – 1873)

... and a modern version 

 “If we are asked why happiness 
matters, we can give no further, 
external reason. It just obviously 
does matter (...). Happiness is that 
ultimate goal because, unlike all 
other goals, it is self-evidently 
good.” 
 Richard Layard (2005), Happiness. 

Lessons from a New Science, 
London/New York, p. 113.

Traditional utilitarianism (Jeremy 
Bentham, 1748 – 1832) – some 
elementary aspects 

 Idea: Actions and policies should be evaluated 

through a comparison of the benefits and 
costs they will impose on society. 

 The “right” action is the one that will produce 

the greatest net benefits 
 If all alternatives have only net costs: ... the one that will 

produce the lowest net costs. 

Detlef Aufderheide

Traditional utilitarianism (Jeremy 
Bentham, 1748 – 1832) – some 
elementary aspects 

 The utilitarian principle: 
 An action is right from an ethical point of view if and only 

if 
 the sum total of utitilities produced by that act 
 is greater than the sum total of utilities produced by 
any other act the agent could have performed in its 
place. 

 Goal of achieving ‘the greatest happiness of the greatest 

number‘. 

 Cf. Velasquez, p. 62. 

Detlef Aufderheide 

12 

 “It is the greatest happiness of the greatest 

number that is the measure of right and 
wrong.” 

 Jeremy Bentham (1789), op .cit., p. 4.  

Detlef Aufderheide 

13 

Common principles of 
utilitarian ethics 

 Emphasis on 

 Consequences 
 Utility 

• Pleasure and happiness (hedonism) vs. pain 
• … but not: arbitrarily or narrowly defined utility! 
• E.g. intellectual, spiritual, cultural pleasures of greater value 

than mere physical pleasure (John St. Mill) 

 Social welfare 

• Maximisation of ‘aggregate utility’ or ‘net social benefits’ 
• What it does NOT imply: egoistic, anti-social hedonism 

 

Detlef Aufderheide 

14 

Some sources of 
misunderstandings 

 Someone defines utilitarianism this way:  
 “Utilitarianism is the view that 

 so long as an action provides me with more measurable 

economic benefits than costs, 

 the action is morally right.” 

 (cit. Velasquez) 

 

Detlef Aufderheide 

15 

Avoiding misunderstandings: 
overview/examples 

 “Utility of the person that performs the 

action.“ 

 “Benefits of an action outweigh its costs.” 
 “Only direct implications count.”  
 “Only measurable benefits/only monetary 

quantities matter.”  

Detlef Aufderheide 

16 

 The Ford Pinto case: What did the Ford 

management do wrongly from a utilitarian 
point of view? 
 

 Reduction to monetary costs and benefits 
 Problem: not necessarily calculus as such – monetary 

assessment as such –, but inappropriate monetary 
assessment. 

 ...

Assumptions of utilitarianism 

 Measurability of utility 
 Possibility of interpersonal comparisons

Development of utilitarian ethics 
(a selection!) 1 

 Act vs. rule utilitarianism 

 Proper object of calculation: single case vs. rule 

 

 What it does not mean: ‘rule of thumb’ with respect to a 

certain action (which would merely be a matter of 
uncertainty) but with respect to the maxim guiding that 
action. 
 

 Example: price-fixing. 

Detlef Aufderheide 

19 

Development of utilitarian ethics 
(a selection!) 2a 

 Two steps of rule utilitarianism: 

 (1) An action is right if and only if the action would be 

required by correct moral rules. 

 (2) A moral rule is correct if and only if 

• the sum total of utilities produced is greater than 

• the sum of utilities produced by any alternative rule (provided 

everyone were to follow the rule). 

Detlef Aufderheide 

20 

Development of utilitarian ethics 
(a selection!) 2b 

 Rule utilitarianism 

 That means: If a certain action would maximise utility on one 

particular occasion this does not imply that it is right from a 
(rule-) utilitarian point of view. 

 The (rule-) utilitarian criterion would only be met 

• if the net benefits of all actions that follow the respective rules taken 

together would be greater than 

• the net benefits of any other class of actions that followed an 

alternative rule. 

Detlef Aufderheide 

21 

Development of utilitarian ethics 
(a selection!) 3 

 Negative utilitarianism 

 Pleasure vs. absence of pain: pursuit of the least amount 

of evil 

 Idea: Greatest harms are more effective than greatest 

pleasures 

 Total vs. average utility 

 Average utilitiy: Taking into account different societies with 

large vs. small numbers of people

Criticism – and utilitarian 
replies to critics (1a) 

 Measurement problems 
 Happiness and pain incommensurable 

 “Human life must not be priced. In a utilitarian analysis, 

an infinite value must be attributed to it. ” 

 What is good - what is evil? 

Detlef Aufderheide 

23 

Criticism – and utilitarian 
replies to critics (1b) 

  Utilitarian replies 

 Problem not specific to utilitarianism 

• See, e.g., triage 

 Weighing lives against one another – utility of saving 

lives against costs of doing so: Potentials and limitations 
of monetary quantities. 

 Priority of intrinsic over instrumental values is 

acknowledged. 

Detlef Aufderheide 

24 

Criticism – and utilitarian 
replies to critics (2) 

 Problems with predictions (sc. of consequences) 

 Reply: Expected utility 

 Problems with intentions  

 Reply: “The road to hell is paved with good intentions.“ 

 Distributional problems (Velasquez: problems with rights 

and justice) 
 Reply: Rule utilitarianism (see above) 

 Are all kinds of criticism being met appropriately by 

utilitarianism?
