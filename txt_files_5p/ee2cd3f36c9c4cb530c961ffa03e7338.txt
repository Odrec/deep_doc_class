Areas involved in the random dot movement 

3 

  FEF: Frontal Eye Field: Motor area for eye-movements 
  LIP: Lateral Intraparietal (Area): guiding eye-movements, working 

memory 

  MT (in macaque monkeys) : middle temporal, motion perception 

Recap: MT 

4 

  Topography: 

¡  Neurons arranged in 

direction hypercolumns 

  Response Properties: 

¡  Most neurons sensitive to 

direction and speed of moving 
luminance contrasts 

¡  Large receptive fields (about 10 

times wider than V1) 

¡  Ocular invariance 

 

 

Recap: Frontal Eye Field 

5 

  Properties:  

¡  Some visually responsive neurons 

(roughly half of them) 

¡  Other neurons elicit saccades and 

are topographically arranged 
(neighboring locations in FEF elicit 
saccades to neighboring sites in the 
visual field) 

¡  Neurons in the ventrolateral part 

(receving input from the fovea) elicit 
short-amplitude saccades (blue) 
¡  Neurons in the dorsomedial part 

(receiving input from the periphery) 
elicit longer-amplitude saccades 
(red) 

Response Properties LIP 

6 

  Experiment: 

¡  Targets appeared in 1 of 8 

locations  

¡  The monkey made an eye 

movement to its remembered 
location when the fixation point 
was extinguished (triangles) 

¡  Record from LIP neuron 

  Results: 

¡  Example neuron exhibited 
increased activity in the delay 
period before saccadic eye 
  
movements to the left. 
¡  Activity after the initiation of 
the saccadic eye movement is 
not included in graphs  

Setup of a Basic Decision Task  

7 

  Random dot stimulus (set of randomly 
moving dots, subset moves coherently 
into one direction)  

  Subset of moving dots is varied 
  Time span of Delay Period is varied 
  Monkey indicates judged direction of 

motion by saccadic eye movement (T1 if 
leftward motion, T2 if rightward motion 
was detected) 

  Record from MT and LIP neurons 

A Basic Decision Task – Results MT 

8 

  Results in MT: 

¡  Neurons in MT are activated 

during presentation of the 
moving dot stimulus for the 
preferred direction 

¡  MT activation scales with 

level of coherence in motion 
to the preferred direction 
¡  The firing stops once the 

stimulus is turned off 

Ø  MT activity seems to reflect 

momentary sensory evidence 
for movement 

A Basic Decision Task – Results LIP 

9 

  Results in LIP: 

¡  T1 but not T2 fell within the 

movement field of LIP neuron 

¡  Activity of the neuron reflected a 

choice for a saccade towards T1, even 
without coherence in the dot-
movement 

¡  Increase of activity for later T1 choise 

during stimulus presentation 

¡  Higher increase for higher coherence 
¡  In delay period after stimulus off-set 

still high activity until saccade 

Ø  LIP activity is influenced by stimulus 

properties but seems to reflect the 
behavioral decision 

LIP and Motion Discrimination 

10 

  Increase of LIP activity for 
decisions towards the LIP 
neuron's preferred 
direction (green lines) for: 

  Dot movement in that 

direction (solid line) 

  But also for non-matching 
movements (dashed line) 
  No Increase of LIP activity 
for decisions away from the 
perferred direction (red 
lines) irrespective of dot 
movement direction 

Ø  LIP activity is influenced by 

stimulus properties but 
seems to reflect the 
behavioral decision. 

LIP as a temporal integrator 

11 
  LIP activity could be integrated over 
time from the evidence given by MT 
neuron's (pro and against preferred 
direction) 

  i.e. the activity from MT neurons that 
code away from preferred direction 
gets substracted from activity of MT 
neurons that code forward the 
preferred direction 

  Example: 

with preferred saccade direction to the 
right 

¡  Grey Histogram: Activity of MT neurons 
with same preferred movement direction 
as LIP saccade direction 

¡  Black Line: Activity of MT neurons with 

opposing preferred movement direction as 
LIP saccade direction   

¡  Red Line: Modelled activity of LIP neuron 

A 3 Stage Model of Decisions 

12 

Stage 1 

13 

  MT neurons fire in response to 
perceived movement direction 
with a higher firing rate the 
higher the movement 
coherence is  

Ø Activitiy of MT-Neurons 

reflects momentary perceived 
evidence 

Stage 2 

14 

  LIP neurons approximate the 

integral of the difference of 
the firing behavior of MT 
neurons with opposing 
direction preferences → 
Integration of sensory 
evidence by neurons in LIP 

Ø Integration of sensory 

evidence by neurons in LIP  

Stage 3 

15 

  The accumulated activation of a 

LIP neuron reaches a certain 
threshold, a decision is made, and 
the saccade can be executed 

Ø Activitiy of LIP-neurons reflects 

decision properties 

Random Dot Experiment – the Reaction Time 

Task 

16 

  Setup: 

¡  Same as before, but without delay period 
¡  Reaction time and neural activity between 

stimulus onset and saccade is measured 

  Results: 

¡  Slope of neuronal activity becomes 

steeper, the more sensory evidence is 
available 

¡  Decisions are made earlier when the 

evidence is stronger 

¡  Average firing rate threshold of about 

68Hz for eliciting the decision, regardless 
of coherence 

FEF and LIP in a Random Dot Experiment 

17 

  Setup: 
cross 

¡  Monkey fixates fixation 

¡  Two targets appear below 
and above fixation point 

¡  Moving dot stimulus 

appears above fixation cross 

¡  Percentage of dots moving 
coherently into one direction 
and viewing time is varied 

¡  Stimulus is turned off: 

÷  The monkey has to indicate 
the movement direction of 
the coherentlymoving dots 
via a saccade to the target 
corresponding to the 
movement direction  

¡  Activity from LIP neuron is 

measured 

¡  Stimulating electrode in 

FEF: in this case FEF 
neuron elicits saccade to the 
right 
 

FEF and LIP in a Random Dot Experiment 

18 

¡  The activity of LIP neurons encoding a decision for a saccade towards a target causes a 

corresponding deviation in the saccade which is induced by FEF stimulation 

¡  The size of this deviation increases with the percentage of coherence and the viewing time of 

  Results: 

the moving dots 

  Conclusion: 

¡  The oculomotor system is informed about the evolving decision and not just the final (post-

threshold) outcome of the decision process.  

¡  Evidence accumulation and motor responses are thus not sequential processes but 

integrated.  

Motion Discrimination Task Variations 

19 

  Pro-saccade task:  

¡  Saccade in direction of coherently moving dots 
¡  Saccades after FEF stimulation were systematically biased by stimulus 

induced decision 

  Colored target task:  

¡  Saccade to randomly placed colored targets that were associated with a 

dot movement direction 

¡  Saccades after FEF stimulation were not biased through direction 

decisions based on a color code leading to a random location 

  Anti-saccade task:  

¡  Saccade had to be in opposing direction of moving dots 
¡  Saccades after FEF stimulation were systematically biased by stimulus 

induced decision 

Ø  Accumulation of information can only be revealed by FEF 
stimulation if the decision matches directly to known eye 
movements. 

Representation of Sensory Evidence 

20 

  Setup:  

degradation  

  Example: 

¡  Participants 
¡  Stimuli belonging to two categories- e.g houses and faces with different levels of 

¡  A Method for measuring neuronal activity at different locations (e.g. fMRI) 

¡  Participants decide if the stimulus is a house or face 
¡  An increase in noise should lead to a decrease in activity  

Representation of Evidence Integration 

21 

  Setup: 

¡  Same as before but measuring from a different area 
  Said area has to fulfill the following criteria: 

1. 

2. 

The larger the sensory evidence, the larger its influence on integration i.e. Less  noise → 
clearer signal 
Activation should correlate with the difference of activation in sensory areas coding for 
evidence (e.g. FFA) and counterevidence (e.g. PPA) for the preferred interpretation of the 
respective integration area (e.g. face)

 setup and tell the results.  
 Compare the outcome of monkey experiments, where pro-saccade, colored-target or anti-
 saccade task were applied.

 choice, where the dots move. (Hint: 3-stage-diagram)  
 What are the experimental ingredients to investigate representations of sensory evidence and 
 evidence integration?

 integrated? Explain using the experimental evidence from FEF micro-stimulations.
