Acquisition of Native Grammar

ﬁrst word: about 12 months

second half of children’s second year: two-word sentences (ﬁrst signs
of grammar)

infants learn their native grammar roughly between 2 and 5 years

grammar is said to have developed by year 4-5 (linguistic adults)

language learning is generally a lot harder for adults

Non-Adjacent Dependencies

”The little boy who lives in our neighborhood always smiles.”

”She is always studying.”

non-adjacent dependencies are building blocks for complex human
grammar

Artiﬁcial Grammars

What is an Artiﬁcial Grammar?

a series of tones that show a dependency on one another

e.g., consonant-vowel pairs

e.g., rules of the form AXB (non-adjacent dependencies)

for example: le ro bu and ﬁ so to

Artiﬁcial Grammars

Why do we use Artiﬁcial Grammars?

natural languages are highly complex

the laboratory setting instead of ”real world”

using tones instead of words

no prosodic cues

⇒ more controlled setting

Eletroencephalography

Why do we use EEG?

because we can’t communicate with young infants

implicit learning

great temporal resolution

event-related potentials

Developmental Loss of Automaticity in Passive Rule
Learning

3 mo and 2 year old infants are able to learn dependencies in artiﬁcial
grammars under passive listening conditions

adults only, if at all, learn under active listening conditions

Research questions:

When does this developmental loss of automaticity in rule learning under

passive listening conditions take place?

Are 4 year old infants still able to learn dependencies in artiﬁcial grammars

under passive listening?

Thesis

My part in all of this:

Analysis of EEG data of 4 year olds

Comparison of the results of 3 mo olds, 2 and 4 year olds and adults

Investigating the development of artiﬁcial grammar learning under
passive listening conditions

Hypothesis

Since the development of the infant’s native grammar

is largely completed by the age of 4,

we expect the subjects to show no MMN

in response to the rule deviants.
