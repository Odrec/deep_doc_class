Conformational complexity of GPCRs 

 Conformational changes induced by ligand binding 
 Constitutive, basal activity, constitutively active mutants 
 Promiscuity of the ligand binding site(s): Agonists, partial agonists,  

antagonists, inverse agonists and modulators 

More “dimmer” than “switch”

Activation of 
G-Proteins 

 Resting state: 

GDP-bound heterotrimeric 
G-protein 
bound to GPCR (?) 

 
 Activated state: 

GTP-bound G-protein, 
dissociated into α and βγ 
subunits 
Dissociated from GPCR 
 

G-Proteins 

 Large α and β-subunits (37-46 kDa) 
 small γ-subunit (8kDa) 

 α-subunit has GTPase activity 
 β and γ-subunits are tightly associated 

 

 

 20 genes for α-subunit, 
 5 for β-subunit 
 12 for γ-subunit 

Different combinations of α, β and γ subunits possible 
 
Specificity towards GPCR is determined by α-subunit, 
Complex role of βγ-subunit 

Classification of heterotrimeric G-proteins 

Gs: stimulation of adenylate cyclase (AC) 
(activation by cholera toxin) 
 
Gi: inhibition of adenylate cyclase, Ca2+-channels 
(inhibited by pertussis toxin) 
 
Gq: activates phospholipase Cβ (IP3, DAG) 
(not affected by toxins)

Rhodopsin 

 Stable in the dark and accessible in mg amounts 

 Constitutive ligand: 11-cis Retinal  

serves as photochemically active chromophore 
 

 

 

 photolytic cis-trans-isomerisation induces signal transduction 

 Covalent bond between retinal and rhodopsin  

(Schiff base mit lysine ε-amino group)

Signal transduction 

extremely fast signal transduction required 

 Rhodopsin recruits Gi-protein Transducin 

 α-subunit of Transducin activates cyclic GMP 

phosphodiesterase 
 

 phosphodiesterase cleaves cGMP to GMP 

 cGMP dissociates from Na-channels, which 

 

 

close 
 

 Hyperpolarization of the cell – low level of 

transmitter release

Summary 

 GPCR play a key role for fast processes (sensing,  

neurotransmission, cardiovascular control) 
 

 3 classes with different role of the N-terminal domain 

 Conformational plasticity: agonist, antagonists, inverse agonists 

 

and modulators 
 

 GPCR signal through hetero-trimeric G-proteins to activate 

 Dimerization of GPCR and asymmetric binding of G-protein 

adenylate cyclase or phospholipase-β 
 

may play a key role for signal activation
