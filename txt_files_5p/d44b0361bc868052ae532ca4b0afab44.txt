Information about a research project about people who were deported 
from Germany to Kosovo

We   are   a   group   of   four   students   studying   intercultural   psychology   at   the
University of Osnabrück in Germany. For our master thesis we would like to
research how people, who have had their application for asylum in Germany
denied, experience their deportation or the so called voluntary return to Kosovo. 

In our opinion,  there is a lot of discussion about refugees in the German scientific
community and the public but there is a lack of talking to people. This is why we
would like to focus on the perspective of refugees and migrants in our project. We
hope that this research can help to draw a broader picture of the meaning of
migration, flight and asylum. 

Therefore we would like to interview people who were deported from Germany or
„returned voluntarily“ and live currently in Kosovo. The interview can be done in
German, English or with translation into the mothertongue of the interviewees.
We can conduct the interview at your place or in our space in Mitrovica. We would
ask you to take two hours of time for the interview. For your effort, the University
of Osnabrück will reimburse you with a compensation of 20 euros. 

If you yourself have applied for Asylum in Germany and are now living (again) in
Kosovo, we would be very happy if you were interested in telling us your personal
story in an interview. There is no right and wrong in what you tell. We are
interested in your personal experiences and attitudes. Any personal data (like
names or places) that are mentioned in the interview will be anonymized to make
sure that it is impossible to draw conclusions about your personal data
