Warm Up

Which statements are correct?

● In MRI a 90° radio-frequency pulse is used to flip the 

orientation of the nuclei's spin into the transverse plane.
● The resonance frequency of a nucleus depends on the 

strength of the magnetic field. Therefore the signal source 
in MRI can be determined with the help of a gradient in the 
magnetic field. 

● The T1 decay time is different for oxygenated and 

deoxygenated hemoglobin. This effect is used to measure 
the BOLD signal in fMRI.

● In a typical case of Graheme-Color synesthesia, certain 

colors are associated with the perception of a specific 
grapheme.

How We See Color - Video

 

 

[11]

Light

Light source
● light sources can be described by power 

wavelength between 380 and 740 nm

spectra / a spectral distribution (how much of 
a particular wavelength is present in the light 
source)

● visible light: electromagnetic radiation with a 

Scene / Surface
● Reflectance function specifies the fraction 

of the light the surface reflects for each 
wavelength

Reflected Light
● From the spectral distribution of the light 

and the reflectance function we can 
compute the spectral distribution of the 
reflected light: pointwise multiplication of the 
reflectance function with the spectral 
distribution of the light yields the spectral 
distribution of the reflected light

The reflectance of light for an object depends on 
spectral distribution of the light source and on the 
 
object's surface.

 

[4]

[1,2,3]

Color & Cones

Photoreceptors:
● rods
● 3 types of cones:

● S: short wavelength, blue, most sensitive at ~420 nm
● M: middle wavelengths, green, most sensitive at 

~530 nm

● L: long wavelengths, red, most sensitive at ~560 nm

Cone Reponse
● For each cone type: pointwise multiply each power of 
the spectral distribution of the reflected light with each 
sensitivity of the cone spectrum

● integrate resulting cone functions to get one value for 

each cone type

The relative 
activation of the 
three cone types in 
response to a visual 
stimulus determines 
the perceived color.

 

 

[5]

[1,2,3]

Metamers

Definition: 
● Colors of objects are perceived as the 

same even though their spectral power 
distributions are different

● The spectra (A) and (B) are metamers for 

human trichromats under illumination 1 
but not under 2 or 3.

How can this be explained?
● there are several spectral power 

distributions that yield the same cone 
responses / color sensation

Metamers and Cones
● Reducing the number of functional cone 
types increases the number of metamers

● The resulting inability to distinguish 
between certain colors is known as 
(partial) color blindness
 

 
[1,2,3]

[6]

Color Blindness

Definition:
● Inability or decreased ability 

to see color, or perceive 
color differences

Cause:
● Absence or malfunction of 

one cone type 
(Dichromacy)

● Alteration of Trichromat 
spectral sensitivity of at 
least one cone type 
(Anomalous trichromacy)
● Defect or absence of at 
least two cone pigments 
(Monochromacy)

➔ Several types of color 

blindness can be defined 
depending on which type 
 
of cone is deficient

 

[7]

[1,2]

Objectively Measuring Color Blindness

Ishihara color test: 

● consists of a series of 

pictures of colored spots

● figure (often digits) are 

embedded in the picture 
with a difference in color 
contrast (but no difference 
in luminance contrast)

● the figure cannot be seen by 

an individual with a 
particular deficit (e.g. 
protanope)

● by varying intensity and type 

of contrast, the type and 
severity of color blindness 
can be determined
 

 

[8]

[1,3]

Color Consistency

Definition: 
● The perceived color of objects remains relatively constant 

under varying illumination conditions

● This is possible even though varying illumination conditions 

imply differences in light reflexion and cone activation

Why is it useful?
● Reliably recognize objects under different illumination 

conditions (e.g. a banana always as yellow)

[9]

Color perception does not only depend on spectral 
power distributions, but is also object- and context 
 
dependent.

 

[1,2,3]

Intermediate Questions

Which statements are correct?

● The perceived color of an object only depends on the 

spectra of the light source and the reflectance properties of 
the object.

● One can infer the reflected spectrum of a stimulus by the 

activation of the different cone types.

● Color blindness can be measured with an Ishihara color 

test, in which the figure is embedded in the luminance 
contrast, but 'overwriten' by the color contrasts.

● The colors of 2 objects can be perceived as the same, even 

though their reflectance distribution lead to different cone 
activation.

Is V4 the color center?

Pro color center:
● Bilateral lesioning of V4 can lead to 

Con color center:
● V4 lesion also lead to attentional and

achromatopsia

● Contains many wavelength selective 

cognitive deficits

cells

● Contains cells that are selective for 
perceived color (color constancy)

V4 is not the only region 
which contains color / 
wavelength sensitive cells.

Furthermore, the sensitivity 
to multiple additional 
features (e.g. Depth, Shape 
and Orientation) suggest a 
more complex role.

 

● form/orientation selective cells
● activity of V4 neurons are also 

selective to the 3D shape of an object
● V4 cells can change their selectivity in

a task dependent manner

● motion selective cells
● also wavelength selective cells in 

other areas (LGN, V1,V2)

 

[1,2,3]

Frontal Eye Field

Properties of FEF:
● FEF is a hub of integration of the dorsal and ventral stream and in general 

involved in the control of eye-movements

● some visually responsive neurons (roughly half of them)
● other neurons elicit saccades and are topographically arranged (neighboring 

locations in FEF elicit saccades to neighboring sites in the visual field)

● neurons in the ventrolateral part (receving input from the fovea) elicit short-

amplitude saccades

● neurons in the dorsomedial part (receiving input from the periphery) elicit 
 

longer-amplitude saccades

 

[1,2,3]

FEF and V4

Goal
● examine the functional interaction 
of saccade preparation (FEF) and 
visual coding (V4) 

Setup:
● record via a microelectrode from 

a neuron in V4, determine it‘s 
receptive field and preferred 
stimulus

● find an area in FEF in which 
microstimulation causes a 
saccade to the RF of the V4 cell

● apply subthreshold (no saccade) 

stimulation to FEF neurons 
(saccade would move to the RF of 
the V4 neuron)

● the monkey maintains central 
fixation during the experiment
 

 

[1,2,3]

FEF and V4

Experiment:
● first show stimulus in V4 cell's RF for 3 

conditions (p: preferred, np: non-
preferred, 

∅
: no stimulus)

● then subthreshold stimulation of FEF and 

recording from V4 (red spikes)

● control: no stimulation of FEF and 

recording from V4 (black spikes)

Results:
● V4 cell shows an increased response to FEF stimulation in 

condition p (a)
∅
, FEF stimulation doesn't seem to influence the 

● in condition 

activity of the V4 cell (b)

● V4 response enhancement through FEF stimulation seems to 

increase with stimulus preference (c)

 

Activity in FEF can up-modulate activity in V4. The effects 
are similar to those observed for attention (enhancement 
of processing preferentially for preferred stimuli)

 

[1,2,3]
