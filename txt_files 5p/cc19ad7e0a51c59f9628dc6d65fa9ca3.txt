Chromosomes comprise of irregularly folded  

10-nm nucleosome fibers 

Chromosomes consist of irregularly folded 10-nm nucleosome fibers. Condensins (blue) hold the nucleosome fibers (red) around 
the center of the chromosome. Locally, the nucleosome fibers are folded in an irregular or disordered manner, forming loop 
structures that collapse towards the center of the chromosome center (blue). The collapsed fiber (red) then forms a domain

Histone modifications and variants at the replication 

 fork with their chaperones 

 

Histone chaperones participate in histone deposition during replication and are key candidates to regulate epigenetic inheritance. Parental H3-H4 histones evicted from chromatin are handled by 
the chaperone ASF1, which also associates with newly synthesized histones [75]. Parental histones and marks are recycled onto daughter strands along with newly synthesized histones with 
characteristic marks [68,107], the latter deposited by the chaperone CAF-1. Mixing of parental and new histones is rare [108] but may have functional consequences. Importantly, away from the 
fork, histones are susceptible to turnover, which can alter the modification landscape.

growing oocytes in the adult mouse ovary at left and in prospermatogonia (a nondividing precursor 
to spermatogonial stem cells) in the testis from a newborn mouse at right. Dnmt3L is expressed in 
testis from    7 days before birth to    3 days after birth.

Histone modification dynamics and maintenance 

Enzymes having opposing activities maintain steady-state levels of histone marks. (B) A model where the polycomb group protein complex propagates H3K27me3 by binding to the parental 
histone mark, which recruits the responsible enzyme to methylate neighboring nucleosomes [83]. (C) Histone variant-specific residues can influence how enzymes entertain their substrates, 
as shown with the ATXR5/6 methyltransferases in plants, where T31 (S31 in mammals) inhibits monomethylation of H3K27 [87].

K to represent lysine methyltransferase – see [109]); KDM, lysine demethylase; PcG, polycomb group protein.
