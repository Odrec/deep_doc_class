Summary: 

24 

Membrane  constriction  is  a  prerequisite  for  cell  division.  The  most  common 

25 

membrane constriction system in prokaryotes is based on the tubulin homologue FtsZ, 

26 

whose  filaments  in  E.  coli  are  anchored  to  the  membrane  by  FtsA  and  enable 

27 

formation  of  the  Z  ring  and  divisome.  The  precise  architecture  of  the  FtsZ  ring  has 

28 

remained  enigmatic.  Here,  we  report  three-dimensional  arrangements  of  FtsZ  and 

29 

FtsA filaments in C. crescentus and E. coli cells and inside constricting liposomes by 

30 

means  of  electron  cryomicroscopy  and  cryotomography.  In  vivo  and  in  vitro,  the  Z-

31 

ring  is  composed  of  a  small,  single-layered  band  of  filaments  parallel  to  the 

32 

membrane, creating a continuous ring through lateral filament contacts. Visualisation 

33 

of the in vitro reconstituted constrictions as well as a complete tracing of the helical 

34 

paths  of  the  filaments  with  a  molecular  model  favour  a  mechanism  of  FtsZ-based 

35 

membrane constriction that is likely to be accompanied by filament siding.

47 

Membrane dynamics during cytokinesis are some of the most fundamental processes 

48 

in  biology,  yet  poorly  understood  at  the  molecular  and  mechanistic  level.  During 

49 

prokaryotic cell division the cell membrane and the cell envelope constrict, eventually 

50 

leading  to  cell  separation.  In  most  bacteria  and  archaea  this  is  guided  by  a  ring 

51 

structure containing the bacterial tubulin homologue FtsZ protein (Bi and Lutkenhaus, 

52 

1991;  Löwe  and  Amos,  1998),  which  polymerises  in  a  GTP-dependent  manner 

53 

(Mukherjee  and  Lutkenhaus,  1994).  During  constriction,  the  FtsZ-ring  decreases  in 

54 

diameter through an unknown mechanism. The C-terminal tail of FtsZ links it to other 

55 

components  of  the  divisome,  an  ensemble  of  many  proteins  that  facilitates  essential 

56 

functions  during  the  cell  division  process,  most  importantly  remodelling  of  the  cell 

57 

envelope.  Components  of  the  divisome  engage  in  cell  wall  synthesis  (PBPs), 

58 

synchronisation with chromosome dimer resolution (FtsK), lipid II cell wall precursor 

59 

flipping  (FtsW  or  MurJ)  and  many  components  currently  have  no  known  function 

60 

(reviews: (Adams and Errington, 2009; Lutkenhaus et al., 2012)). 

61 

In Escherichia coli, binding of the FtsZ tail to ZipA and possibly more importantly to 

62 

FtsA anchors the FtsZ-ring to the membrane (Pichoff and Lutkenhaus, 2007). FtsA is 

63 

a  bacterial  actin-like  protein  that  forms  domain-swapped,  canonical  actin-like 

64 

protofilaments  that  are  membrane  associated  through  FtsA's  C-terminal  amphipathic 

65 

helix (Pichoff and Lutkenhaus, 2005; Szwedziak et al., 2012; van den Ent and Löwe, 

66 

2000).  Several  cellular  regulatory  processes  influence  the  onset  and  progression  of 

67 

cell  division  through  mechanisms  that  directly  act  on  FtsZ.  For  example,  SulA  is 

68 

induced  during  the  SOS  stress  response  and  sequesters  monomers,  stopping  FtsZ 

69 

polymerisation  (Chen  et  al.,  2012).  In  E.  coli,  both  nucleoid  occlusion  and  the 

70 

oscillating,  pole-protecting  MinCDE  system  contain  components  that  inhibit  FtsZ 

71 

function within the ring directly (Bernhardt and de Boer, 2005; Dajkovic et al., 2008).

72 

Although  progress  has  been  exhilarating  over  that  past  20  years  or  so,  some  of  the 

73 

most fundamental questions still remain: what happens during FtsZ-ring constriction? 

74 

How are the filaments arranged in the ring? What drives constriction? 

75 

Many  different  models  have  been  proposed  for  the  mechanism  of  FtsZ-based 

76 

constriction  (reviewed  in  (Erickson,  2009;  Erickson  et  al.,  2010)).  Essentially,  three 

77 

different approaches have been taken to validate the models: in vivo imaging of FtsZ 

78 

constrictions using fluorescently labelled proteins. Electron cryotomography of frozen 

79 

hydrated  cells  without  labelling  and  thirdly  in  vitro  reconstitution  experiments  with 

80 

pure,  fluorescently  labelled  proteins.  The  most  recent  results  emanating  from  those 

81 

studies are that the rings appear to show strong fluorescence intensity variations that 

82 

may  suggest  that  the  FtsZ  ring  is  discontinuous  (Holden  et  al.,  2014).  Equally, 

83 

tomography  data  has  been  interpreted  to  show  scattered,  individual  FtsZ  filaments 

84 

some  precise  distance  away  from  the  membrane  (Li  et  al.,  2007).  Reconstitution 

85 

experiments  with  FtsZ  and  FtsA  showed  dynamic  behaviour  and  liposome 

86 

constrictions  (Loose  and  Mitchison,  2014;  Osawa  and  Erickson,  2013).  However, 

87 

obtaining  detailed,  molecular  and  mechanistic  information  regarding  the  FtsZ  ring, 

88 

particularly the arrangement of individual filaments and subunits within a constricting 

89 

Z- ring, has remained a formidable challenge.  

90 

Here, we obtained high-resolution images of the FtsZ ring in Caulobacter crescentus 

91 

and  Escherichia  coli  by  means  of  electron  cryotomography.  Furthermore,  we 

92 

reconstituted  a  minimal  constriction 

force-generating  system 

from  purified 

93 

components  in  vitro,  encapsulating  Thermotoga  maritima  FtsA  (TmFtsA)  and  FtsZ 

94 

(TmFtsZ)  in  liposomes  of  sizes  corresponding  to  those  of  a  bacterial  cell.  We 

95 

produced images and three-dimensional maps of filaments arranging themselves into 

96 

ring structures around the liposome perimeters that coincided with constriction sites.

97 

The  observed  FtsZ  ring  architectures  in  C.  crescentus  and  E.  coli  cells  and  in 

98 

liposomes  favour  a  mechanism  of  FtsZ-based  cell  membrane  constriction  that  is 

99 

accompanied by filament sliding, as was proposed previously (Lan et al., 2009).

Results: 

101 

Single-layered and continuous FtsZ ring in unmodified C. crescentus cells. 

102 

We  started  out  by  visualising  division  sites  in  an  unmodified  C.  crescentus  strain 

103 

(NA1000/CB15N)  because  the  thin  Caulobacter  cells  are  most  suitable  for  electron 

104 

cryotomography.  When  a  log-phase  culture  was  plunge-frozen  and  imaged,  many 

105 

dividing  cells  could  be  found.  At  the  division  sites,  a  series  of  dots  arranged  in  a 

106 

single  line  were  found  (Figure  1A,  top).  Careful  analysis  of  cellular  tomograms 

107 

(Movie M1 and Figure 1A, bottom) revealed that the dots were in fact 2D projections 

108 

of  filamentous  structures  encircling  the  cell  and  likely  forming  a  continuous  ring, 

109 

disrupted  in  the  images  at  the  top  and  bottom  by  the  missing  wedge  of  the 

110 

tomography  method.  The  filaments  were  at  a  distance  of  15  ±  2  nm  from  the  inner 

111 

membrane  (Figure  1B)  as  previously  reported  (Li  et  al.,  2007).  The  long-standing 

112 

problem of the missing wedge in electron tomography caused by our current inability 

113 

to  tilt  the  specimen  much  beyond  65°  (Figure  1A,  bottom,  white  triangle,  see  also 

114 

Figure 1—figure supplement 1 for more details on the missing wedge problem related 

115 

to  this  study)  makes  it  impossible  to  follow  features  all  the  way  around  the  cell's 

116 

perimeter. It is important to note, however, that the protein filaments are visible and 

117 

un-interrupted  everywhere  the  missing  wedge  allows  it,  as  can  be  gauged  from  the 

118 

disappearance of the cell membrane and envelope (Figure 1A & B). We could detect 

119 

the filamentous rings in 20 out of 28 dividing cells after tomography. Of the 8 without 

120 

obvious filamentous structures, in 3 the division had progressed too far and 5 were of 

121 

poor quality because of the cell's orientation with respect to the tilt axis (Figure 1—

122 

figure  supplement  1).  Hence,  the  finding  of  complete  rings  is  supported  by  the  fact 

123 

that  perfect  coincidence  of  any  hypothetical  gaps  in  constricting  rings  with  the

FtsZ-ring                                                                                                Szwedziak 2014 

124 

missing wedges in all of the analysed tomograms, found after all in entirely random 

125 

orientations, would be remarkably implausible. 

126 

Identical FtsZ ring architecture in unmodified E. coli. 

127 

To  investigate  the  generality  of  these  findings,  we  imaged  unmodified  E.  coli  B/r 

128 

H266  cells,  which  we  chose  because  of  their  thinness  (Woldringh,  1976).  Although 

129 

the E. coli cells were thicker than C. crescentus, we found the wild-type filaments still 

130 

discernible, most obviously when imaged along the long axis of cells (Figure 1C and 

131 

Figure  1—figure  supplement  2,  especially  B  and  D;  Movie  M2),  and  these  were  16 

132 

nm away from the IM. Based on these observations we concluded that E. coli Z-rings 

133 

were, like in C. crescentus, probably continuous and consisted of single-layered bands 

134 

that are 5-10 filaments wide.  

135 

In order to investigate if the filaments imaged in wild-type cells so far contained FtsZ 

136 

protein, we over-expressed FtsZ(D212A), a mutant protein that hydrolyses GTP much 

137 

more slowly (Redick et al., 2005) in E. coli B/r H266 cells. When over-expressed to 

138 

2.5 fold total FtsZ (Figure 1D), the protein formed a wide single layer of filaments at 

139 

the division site (Figure 1E, see also Movie M3 and Figure 1—figure supplement 3), 

140 

very  similar  to  the  bands  seen  in  unmodified  cells,  but  wider  and  containing  more 

141 

filaments as would be expected because there is now more FtsZ protein in the cell and 

142 

filament  dynamics  have  been  reduced  because  of  the  GTPase-reducing  mutation 

143 

D212A.  Figure  1F  (Figure  1—figure  supplement  3A-C)  provides  a  view  rotated  by 

144 

90°, showing again that the filamentous ring was located approximately 16 nm away 

145 

from  the  inner  membrane  (IM).  The  band  of  filaments  most  likely  consisted  of 

146 

doublets of individual protofilaments, as is indicated in Figure 1G, which shows a cell 

147 

with higher expression level (Figure 1—figure supplement 3A-C). The filaments were

FtsZ-ring                                                                                                Szwedziak 2014 

148 

on  average  6.8  nm  apart  (n  =  17,  distance  between  centres  of  adjacent  filaments 

149 

within a doublet, Figure 1G, lower). It is currently not known what lateral interactions 

150 

between FtsZ filaments cause this arrangement or if it is facilitated by other proteins. 

151 

The filaments observed in the tomograms are FtsZ.  

152 

Because no specific label for electron cryotomography currently exists that works in 

153 

E. coli, we decided to further confirm the identity of the filaments as being composed 

154 

of FtsZ by systematic perturbations of the system in four (a-d) separate experiments 

155 

with  subsequent  imaging  by  electron  cryotomography  (Figure  1—figure  supplement 

156 

5, Supplementary File 1A & 1B). (a) Introducing extra amino acids into the flexible 

157 

linker  (Buske  and  Levin,  2013;  Gardner  et  al.,  2013)  within  FtsZ  that  separates  the 

158 

globular N-terminal domain of FtsZ from the small C-terminal helix that binds FtsZ's 

159 

membrane anchor, FtsA (Ma and Margolin, 1999; Szwedziak et al., 2012), increased 

160 

the distance between the FtsZ ring and the IM from 16 nm to a somewhat variable 16 

161 

-  21  nm  (Figure  1H  and  Figure  1—figure  supplement  4A-C).  (b)  Removing  the  C-

162 

terminal FtsA-interacting helix and replacing it with a membrane-targeting sequence 

163 

(mts) from MinD protein (Hu and Lutkenhaus, 2003) shortened the distance from the 

164 

IM to 10 nm. No constrictions of the cells were observed (Figure 1I and Figure 1—

165 

figure  supplement  4D).  Therefore,  despite  it  having  been  used  in  earlier  studies 

166 

(Loose  and  Mitchison,  2014;  Osawa  et  al.,  2008;  Osawa  et  al.,  2009;  Osawa  and 

167 

Erickson,  2011),  we  agree  with  previous  findings  (Osawa  et  al.,  2008)  that  this 

168 

construct is non-functional in vivo and we did not include it in our subsequent in vitro 

169 

investigations  below.  (c)  Removing  the  C-terminal  FtsA-interacting  helix  from  FtsZ 

170 

detached  the  filaments  from  the  membrane,  making  them  appear  throughout  the 

171 

cytoplasm  (Figure  1J  and  Figure  1—figure  supplement  4E).  (d)  Finally,  removing 

172 

most  amino  acids  between  the  C-terminal  FtsA-interacting  helix  and  the  globular 

 

8 

 

FtsZ-ring                                                                                                Szwedziak 2014 

173 

body  of  FtsZ  caused  a  minicell  phenotype.  Because  of  their  size,  minicells  produce 

174 

tomograms of higher quality and it was possible to determine the longitudinal subunit 

175 

repeat of the filaments to be around 4 nm, very close to the expected value of 4.2 nm 

176 

for FtsZ (Figure 1K & L and Figure 1—figure supplement 4G) (Erickson et al., 1996). 

177 

We  conclude  that  the  filament  localisations  reacted  to  our  perturbations  as  expected 

178 

for  FtsZ  and  the  subunit  repeat  was  the  same  as  for  all  known  FtsZ  protofilaments. 

179 

The  minicell  tomogram  (Figure  1K)  is  another  indication  that  the  filaments  most 

180 

likely encircle entire cells.  

181 

Extra septa generated by additional FtsZ and FtsA function in cell separation. 

182 

Encouraged  by  reports  that  simultaneous  overexpression  of  FtsZ  and  its  membrane 

183 

anchor  FtsA  led  to  additional  division  sites  (Begg  et  al.,  1998),  we  imaged  E.  coli 

184 

cells  in  which  extra  FtsZ(D212A)  and  FtsA  were  produced  from  a  bicistronic 

185 

expression  vector,  by  electron  cryotomography  (Figure  2A-E).  Providing  just  these 

186 

two  proteins  in  excess  (2  to  4-fold  total  vs.  WT)  produced  a  severe  phenotype  with 

187 

many extra constrictions visible (Figure 2A & B). Since in these cells the normal FtsZ 

188 

to  FtsA  ratio  had  been  altered  to  be  close  to  1:1,  from  normally  5  FtsZ  :  1  FtsA 

189 

(Rueda  et  al.,  2003),  FtsA  filaments  became  visible  at  the  constricting  division  sites 

190 

(Figure  2C-E).  Actin-like  FtsA  binds  to  the  membrane  directly  via  its  C-terminal 

191 

amphipathic  helix  and  polymerises  into  canonical  actin-like  protofilaments  (Lara  et 

192 

al.,  2005;  Szwedziak  et  al.,  2012).  In  this  way,  an  artificially  strong  'FtsA  ring' 

193 

became apparent, indicating that FtsA is located between the IM and FtsZ, being 8 nm 

194 

away from both (Figure 2D & E). 

195 

We then demonstrated that the FtsZ(D212A) and FtsA-overexpressing E. coli cells we 

196 

had  imaged  at  high  resolution  with  electron  cryotomography  were  dividing  and 

 

 

9 

FtsZ-ring                                                                                                Szwedziak 2014 

197 

separating,  despite  looking  quite  distorted.  For  this  we  employed  structured 

198 

illumination  microscopy  (SIM)  on  live  cells  (Figure  2F).  The  cells  showed  a  strong 

199 

minicell phenotype, while performing many cell divisions randomly distributed along 

200 

the cell length. This indicated to us that the extra constrictions and division sites were 

201 

functional in the sense that they led to complete cell separation (abscission). 

202 

We concluded that the ability to produce extra constriction sites and divisions by just 

203 

providing  more  FtsZ  and  FtsA  indicates  that  these  two  proteins  may  be  central 

204 

components  of  the  IM  constriction  force  generator  that  is  localised  within  the  inner 

205 

division  apparatus  (Rico  et  al.,  2013)  and  that  it  may  be  possible  to  reconstitute 

206 

membrane  constriction  with  just  the  two  of  them.  Indeed,  this  has  recently  been 

207 

reported  and  has  been  imaged  at  low  resolution  using  fluorescence  microscopy 

208 

(Osawa  et  al.,  2008;  Osawa  and  Erickson,  2013),  although  not  providing  any 

209 

molecular insights. 

210 

Reconstituting liposome constrictions in vitro using T. maritima FtsA and FtsZ. 

211 

So  we  then  used  purified  FtsZ  and  FtsA  proteins  for  in  vitro  reconstitution 

212 

experiments,  in  order  to  observe  constriction.  We  avoided  fluorescently  tagged 

213 

proteins  as  they  have  been  shown  to  introduce  artefacts  (Margolin,  2012).  We 

214 

therefore  used  completely  unmodified  TmFtsZ  and  TmFtsA  proteins  from 

215 

Thermotoga maritima, both of which are easy to  obtain and handle and have  crystal 

216 

structures  available  (Oliva  et  al.,  2004;  van  den  Ent  and  Löwe,  2000).  It  should  be 

217 

noted that extra care had to be taken in order to obtain proteins that did not have their 

218 

disordered but important C-terminal tails cleaved during purification. Just to confirm 

219 

that TmFtsZ and TmFtsA formed structures similar to the E. coli counterparts in vivo, 

220 

we overexpressed TmFtsZ and TmFtsA in E. coli and imaged the sample by electron

cryotomography  (Figure  2G).  Minicells  were  formed  and  at  constriction  sites  they 

222 

contained  filaments  that  closely  resembled  the  filament  arrangement  observed  here 

223 

for  E.  coli  FtsA  and  FtsZ  overexpression  in  E.  coli  (Figure  2C).  The  distance  of 

224 

TmFtsZ to the IM was shorter at 12 nm; this was expected because the linker between 

225 

the  very  C-terminal  TmFtsA-interacting  helix  and  the  body  of  TmFtsZ  is  much 

226 

shorter,  measuring  around  9  amino  acids.  Minicell  formation  might  indicate  that 

227 

TmFtsA  and  TmFtsZ  interacted  with  the  E.  coli  cell  division  machinery  or  even 

228 

supported membrane constriction on their own, but we did not investigate this further. 

229 

FtsA and FtsZ form spirals on a flat lipid surface. 

230 

When added onto a flat lipid monolayer, TmFtsZ and TmFtsA formed striking spirals 

231 

(Figure 3A). The filaments forming  the spirals tended to form  weak doublets and in 

232 

the centre of the spirals white material was visible that may have been lipid that had 

233 

been pushed up by the spiral constricting, possibly via a sliding filament mechanism 

234 

as  has  previously  been  observed  for  FtsZ  alone  by  AFM  (Mingorance  et  al.,  2005). 

235 

Intriguingly,  much  larger  dynamic  chiral  spirals  of  polar  FtsA  and  FtsZ  filaments 

236 

have recently been reported on supported lipid bilayers (Loose and Mitchison, 2014) 

237 

but the exact relationship with our observation is currently unclear as treadmilling and 

238 

no constriction was observed on the supported bilayers. 

239 

FtsA  and  FtsZ  polymers  together  generate  negative  curvature  on  liposome 

240 

surfaces. 

241 

Since  the  FtsZ  ring  in  vivo  does  not  act  on  flat  membranes,  we  then  switched  to 

242 

liposomes formed from E. coli lipid extract. First, TmFtsZ and TmFtsA were added to 

243 

pre-formed  liposomes  so  that  the  proteins  remained  on  the  outside  (Figure  3B  and 

244 

Figure  3—figure  supplement  1A).  Reactions  containing  liposomes  and  proteins  as

245 

indicated  were  vitrified  and  imaged  by  conventional  2D  transmission  electron 

246 

cryomicroscopy.  When  no  protein  was  added,  the  liposomes  appeared  as  almost 

247 

perfect circles (spheres in projection) and the bilayers were clearly visible as a double 

248 

line,  5  nm  apart  (Figure  3B,  top,  Figure  3—figure  supplement  2D).  The  addition  of 

249 

TmFtsA  alone  led  to  formation  of  an  additional  layer,  probably  consisting  of  only 

250 

partly polymerised protein, and no strong deformations were observed. TmFtsZ alone 

251 

did  not  cause  deformations  or  generation  of  an  additional  layer  (Figure  3—figure 

252 

supplement 2B). But when both TmFtsA and TmFtsZ were added, two extra layers, in 

253 

addition  to  the  liposome  bilayer,  became  visible  (Figure  3B).  Particularly  in  the 

254 

presence  of  nucleotide,  strong  negative  curvature  was 

induced, 

leading 

to 

255 

deformations of the liposomes  (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A). As was suggested 

256 

previously, the co-polymerisation of FtsZ and FtsA will lead to bending and curvature 

257 

because  the  subunit  repeat  lengths  of  FtsZ  and  FtsA  are  roughly  4  and  5  nm, 

258 

respectively (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B and Figure 3—figure supplement 2A) 

259 

(Szwedziak et  al.,  2012). We  propose  that  the  subunit repeat  mismatch  causes  some 

260 

deformations from the outside of the liposomes, especially when FtsZ polymerisation-

261 

inducing  GMPCPP  is  present  so  that  long  filaments  are  formed  that  will  exert  more 

262 

mechanical force. 

263 

Incorporating  FtsA  and  FtsZ  on  the  inside  of  liposomes  leads  to  spontaneous 

264 

constrictions. 

265 

Since TmFtsZ and TmFtsA induce negative membrane curvature, we concluded that 

266 

in  order  to  reconstitute  the  actions  of  these  proteins  correctly,  we  needed  to 

267 

incorporate  them  on  the  inside  of  liposomes.  For  this,  CHAPS  detergent-solubilised 

268 

E.  coli  lipid  extract  was  mixed  with  the  proteins  at  high  concentrations  and  then 

269 

diluted  many-fold.  Lowering  of  the  detergent  concentration  by  dilution  led  to

270 

spontaneous  liposome  formation  with  most  of  the  proteins  on  the  inside.  We 

271 

demonstrated  with  a  time-lapse  experiment  that  liposomes  did  not  form  around  pre-

272 

existing FtsZ scaffolds since we observed that most liposomes were initially perfectly 

273 

spherical and that they deformed over a 30-minute period, after which most of them 

274 

were heavily misshapen (Figure 3—figure supplement 2C, E).  

275 

The  liposomes  were  then  analysed  by  transmission  electron  cryomicroscopy. 

276 

Amazingly,  when  both  TmFtsZ  and  TmFtsA  were  included  on  the  inside  of 

277 

liposomes, clear constriction sites appeared  and these occurred only when  supported 

278 

by filaments (Figure 3C-G). The liposomes were around 300 nm in diameter, similar 

279 

to that of a small bacterial cell. The protein filaments were arranged into three distinct 

280 

structures:  arcs  that  were  mostly  single  filaments,  presumably  formed  by  the  co-

281 

polymerisation of TmFtsZ  and TmFtsA, showing the characteristic curvature caused 

282 

by  the  repeat  mismatch  (Szwedziak  et  al.,  2012);  spirals  with  decreasing  curvature 

283 

that  appeared  in  perfectly  spherical  areas  of  the  liposomes;  and  rings  of  filaments, 

284 

appearing  as  bands  in  projection,  formed  around  liposome  constriction  sites,  with 

285 

varying diameters. It is very important to note that constrictions only appeared where 

286 

there  were  rings  of  filaments.  Filaments  within  the  liposomes  had  very  different 

287 

curvatures, for example in Figure 3D, filaments seemed to go round the liposome at a 

288 

very large diameter, compared to the ones in the constriction zone further to the left. 

289 

When the constriction sites were imaged at higher  magnification, it became possible 

290 

to  discern  the  TmFtsA  and  TmFtsZ  filaments  end-on  (Figure  3H-J).  The  FtsA 

291 

filaments  were  again  sandwiched  between  the  liposome  membrane  and  the  FtsZ 

292 

filaments,  just  as  in  the  images  obtained  with  E.  coli  cells  (Figure  2C  &  G).  The 

293 

architecture  is  easily  explained  with  TmFtsA  binding  to  the  inside  of  the  liposome 

294 

membrane via its amphipathic helix, presumably polymerising, and FtsZ polymerising

295 

on  top  of  FtsA,  binding  to  it  via  its  C-terminal  FtsA  binding  peptide  (Pichoff  and 

296 

Lutkenhaus, 2005; Szwedziak et al., 2012). Nucleotide presence had some influence 

297 

on the appearance of these constricted liposomes as GTP addition produced the most 

298 

bilobed  liposomes.  Constriction  itself,  however,  was  largely  nucleotide  hydrolysis 

299 

independent since not adding any nucleotide produced constrictions as well, and they 

300 

appeared  even  tighter  (Figure  3E).  Therefore,  despite  not  being  strictly  required  for 

301 

constriction,  we  believe  the  nucleotide  only  has  an  influence  on  the  appearance 

302 

thereof and this might be due to the fact that FtsZ forms much longer filaments with 

303 

polymerisation-inducing  GTP  added  and  this  would  enable  the  filaments  to  span 

304 

larger  liposomes  when  the  process starts.  Given  that  TmFtsZ  is  a  hyperthermophilic 

305 

protein, significant hydrolysis of GTP to GDP is not expected. 

306 

Detailed architecture of the liposome constrictions revealed in three dimensions 

307 

by electron cryotomography. 

 

308 

Next  we  employed  electron  cryotomography  to  image  the  liposomes  in  three 

309 

dimensions (Figure 4, Figure 4—figure supplement 1, Movies M4-M10). Because the 

310 

samples only contained lipid and two proteins, contrast was very high in the resulting 

311 

tomograms  (Movie  M4  &  M5),  making  it  possible  to  represent  the  volume  data 

312 

without  segmentation,  as  single-threshold  surfaces  or  as  volume  renderings  (Movie 

313 

M6-M10, Figure 4–source data 1 PyMOL session file). None of the figures or movies 

314 

we  present  has  been  segmented,  manually  or  automatically.  Figure  4A,  top  shows  a 

315 

constricted liposome in stereo, highlighting the three distinct filament architectures in 

316 

detail:  arcs,  spiral  domes  at  the  'poles'  and  the  filamentous  ring,  pulling  and 

317 

constricting the membrane. Note that the liposome was only deformed where the ring 

318 

was  located  (and  where  it  unfortunately  touched  the  carbon  grid  at  the  top  right). 

319 

More  examples  in  Figure  4A,  bottom  and  Figure  4—figure  supplement  1  show  the

same  overall  architecture,  with  the  same  mix  of  filament  architectures  (also  Movies 

321 

M6-M10).  The  TmFtsAZ  rings  were  between  30  and  90  nm  in  diameter  when  we 

322 

looked at several different liposomes and the filaments were on average 7.8 nm apart 

323 

(n  =  16)  laterally  (Figure  4B  and  C)  as  compared  to  6.8  nm  seen  in  E.  coli  cells 

324 

(within  doublets).  Because  contrast  was  very  high,  the  ring  of  filaments  could  be 

325 

traced in most tomograms all around the inside of the liposome and this revealed that 

326 

the filaments were not totally equidistant and often came into contact. This was also 

327 

true for the in vivo situation in C. crescentus (Movie M1) where the distance between 

328 

the  filaments  (gray  arrow)  changes  around  the  ring.  The  rings  were  always  closed, 

329 

continuous  without  gaps,  with  some  possibly  consisting  of  one  double  filament 

330 

forming a helix (Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and Movie M6) and others containing 

331 

several  shorter  filaments  in  a  helix-like  arrangement  (Figure  4A  stereo  view  and 

332 

Movie M10). When the filaments were investigated end-on, they appeared to always 

333 

be arranged close to 90° with respect to the liposome membrane tangent (Figure 4C), 

334 

which  was  also  observed  for  the  filaments  in  cells  (Figures  2C  &  G).  All  of  these 

335 

features  are  best  demonstrated  in  Movie  M10,  which  provides  an  overview  of  the 

336 

constriction  and  filament  architectures  and  should  be  consulted  to  appreciate  these 

337 

findings properly.

Map quality allowed us to fit the FtsZ crystal structure manually and roughly through

a  spline  curve  and  arrive  at  a  pseudo-atomic  model  for  an  FtsZ  ring  (Figure  5A), 

341 

making it possible to judge distances and dimensions relative to the crystal structures. 

342 

A more detailed view using sphere representation (Figure 5B) shows, again, that the 

343 

filaments  within  a  ring  were  not  exactly  equidistant  (black  arrows)  but  came  into 

344 

direct contact only at certain points. Fitting the FtsA crystal structure into the map as

347 

the subunits along the filament of the molecules can only be guessed in most places 

348 

given  the  resolution  limit.  It  should  be  noted,  though,  that  peaks  appear  in  many 

349 

places indicating the centre positions of individual FtsZ molecules (Figure 5C, Figure

Discussion: 

353 

Constriction is accompanied by filament sliding. 

354 

How do FtsZ and FtsA constrict liposomes? Is this likely to be related to the  in vivo 

355 

situation? Given that the filament architectures observed here in C. crescentus and E. 

356 

coli, and in constricting liposomes are so similar we would suggest that the model we 

357 

propose should be valid for both in vitro and in vivo, at least at some primordial level. 

358 

FtsA  forms  (partial)  filaments  between  the  membrane  and  FtsZ  filaments,  and  the 

359 

filaments together encircle the constriction site while forming a single-layered small 

360 

band of filaments. The entire structure is slightly helical and shorter filaments overlap 

361 

to form a continuous, closed ring. 

362 

By  imaging  completely  unmodified  cells,  utilising  recent  advances  in  cryo-EM  and 

363 

acquiring tomograms of cells parallel to the tilt axis we concluded that the FtsZ ring 

364 

in  cells  is  most  likely  continuous,  probably  made  of  shorter  overlapping  filaments. 

365 

Previous  analysis  of  C.  crescentus  cells  by  cryo-ET  also  showed  that  the  FtsZ  ring 

366 

consists  of  overlapping  filaments  inside  the  inner  membrane,  although  not  all  cells 

367 

showed  continuous  rings  (Li  et  al.,  2007).  Equally,  results  obtained  with  super 

368 

resolution  fluorescence  microscopy  techniques  (Holden  et  al.,  2014)  showed 

369 

punctuated  fluorescence,  possibly  indicating  non-continuous  rings.  We  think  it  is 

370 

important to point out that fluorescence microscopy only images the labelled species 

371 

and intensity fluctuations within the ring may have arisen from using non-functional 

372 

GFP  fusions  and/or  their  over-expression.  Or  fluctuations  coming  from  overlapping 

373 

filaments may have been over-emphasised during image analysis because of very low 

374 

signal-to-noise.  Unfortunately, currently, cellular tomography data is too weak to  be 

375 

able to trace individual filaments and their ends with confidence so we have no direct

FtsZ-ring                                                                                                Szwedziak 2014 

376 

evidence from our in vivo data for the length of individual FtsZ filaments making up 

377 

continuous rings. 

378 

Given a continuous ring, at least in the in vitro situation, with no GTP turnover (or no 

379 

added  nucleotide)  there  is  no  filament  shortening,  meaning  constriction  requires  the 

380 

filaments  to  slide  along  each  other  as  the  ring  decreases  in  diameter  and  the 

381 

membrane  deforms.  That  opposing  forces  from  the  filaments  and  the  membrane 

382 

surface are at work is most evident from the fact that the rings were always perfectly 

383 

round, in contrast to the rest of the liposomes (Figure 4B, middle, Movie M10). 

384 

In this context the filament spirals that form shallow 'dome' structures in some of the 

385 

liposomes  and  on  flat  monolayers  (Figure  3A,  4A,  top  and  Figure  4—figure 

386 

supplement  1)  are  most  revealing.  They  appear  to  be  the  result  of  sliding  and 

387 

condensation,  and  show  decreasing  filament  curvature,  but  do  not  deform  the  lipid 

388 

membrane.  This  can  be  explained  because  the  constriction  force,  which  acts  in  the 

389 

plane  of  the  spirals,  will  not  exert  any  force  on  the  membrane  since  it  is  tangential 

390 

(Figure 5D, right). In contrast, if the filaments form a ring around the volume of the 

391 

liposome  (in  the  middle,  not  at  the  poles),  the  constriction  force  is  perpendicular  to 

392 

the membrane and will lead to the membrane being pulled in (Figure 5D, left). 

393 

Since  in  this  model  force  generation  is  dependent  on  a  closed  ring,  the  system 

394 

becomes self-regulating since constriction will only commence after a complete ring 

395 

has  formed.  If  the  cell is  too  large or  not  enough  FtsZ  is  available, constriction  will 

396 

not begin. It is important to note that only a closed, continuous ring is required, but it 

397 

may consist of a number of shorter, overlapping filaments (as it did  in the liposome 

398 

reconstitutions, Figure 4).  

399 

Where is the energy coming from for sliding and constriction? 

 

 

18 

FtsZ-ring                                                                                                Szwedziak 2014 

400 

What  drives  constriction  of  the  closed  rings  and  filament  sliding? We  propose  three 

401 

possible  mechanisms  that  may  even  act  in  concert:  (a)  maximising  filament  overlap 

402 

via  sliding,  (b)  increasing  repeat  mismatch  and  (c)  repeated  filament  shortening 

403 

through nucleotide turnover.  

404 

(a) When the overlap between the filaments that are attracted to each other increases, 

405 

more  and  more  binding  energy  is  produced.  This  has  been  proposed  before  to  be 

406 

theoretically sufficient for the constriction process (Lan et al., 2009) (Figure 5E). The 

407 

lateral spacing of 6.5-8 nm between filaments we report here is slightly larger than the 

408 

thickness of FtsZ filaments and presumably also FtsA filaments (Matsui et al., 2012; 

409 

Szwedziak et al., 2012). Previous in vitro work reported an interfilament distance of 5 

410 

nm using FtsZ-mts, however, this was after negative staining and dehydration and no 

411 

constrictions  were  observed,  possibly  due  to  lateral  interactions  being  too  tight 

412 

(Milam et al., 2012). In C. crescentus cells the lateral spacing between filaments was 

413 

found  to  be  9.3  nm  previously  (Li  et  al.,  2007)(Li  et  al.,  2007)  and  we  report  here 

414 

distances of ~ 7.8 (Figure 1A) in C. crescentus and ~ 6.8 nm (Figure 1G) in E. coli. 

415 

AFM  using  only  FtsZ,  but  observing  spiral  condensation,  provided  an  even  larger 

416 

distance of 12 nm (Mingorance et al., 2005). All of these measurements are averages 

417 

with  large  variances.  One  may  conclude  that  the  filaments  in  the  FtsZ  ring  interact 

418 

transiently and direct contact is localised to only a few small regions within the ring at 

419 

a time. This could facilitate the constriction process since the filaments have to be free 

420 

to  slide.  It  was  suggested  previously  that  instead  of  forming  many  intermolecular 

421 

solid  bonds,  which  would  lead  to  avidity  and  a  barrier  to  sliding,  an  attractive  force 

422 

over a longer distance would keep the filaments apart while interacting (Hörger et al., 

423 

2008). This is more akin to the liquid state of matter, where many transient homotypic 

 

 

19 

FtsZ-ring                                                                                                Szwedziak 2014 

424 

interactions, counteracted by thermal motion, lead to a fluid situation without absolute 

425 

order but still keeping the molecules together.

(b) The second possible driver of constriction comes from the repeat length mismatch 

427 

of FtsA and FtsZ (Szwedziak et al., 2012). Although it is evident from our data that 

428 

the curvature of individual filaments can not deform liposomes significantly from the 

429 

inside,  the  decreasing  diameter  of  the  ring  accompanied  by  increasing  membrane 

430 

curvature might enable more and more FtsA to be added, until an optimum curvature 

431 

of the system has been achieved (Figure 4—figure supplement 2); this could provide 

432 

additional  energy  and  would  also  explain  why  FtsA  exists  at  all  and  FtsZ  is  not 

433 

directly attached to the membrane.  

434 

(c) Why does FtsZ hydrolyse GTP then? We speculate that when constriction starts at 

435 

large  diameters (1  µm  in  E.  coli),  longer  GTP-induced  FtsZ  filaments  are  needed  to 

436 

reach  reliably  around  the  cell  in  order  to  produce  overlap,  for  the  ring  and  'force 

437 

engagement'  to  start  the  process.  However,  increasing  overlap,  developing  as  the 

438 

constriction progresses, might lead to a kinetic barrier of sliding through avidity and 

439 

the filaments would then have to be shortened. Formally this provides a third possible 

440 

driver of constriction, at least for large constriction distances. 

441 

Dynamics of the FtsZ ring are essential for its function.  

442 

Continual  depolymerisation  and  re-polymerisation  through  nucleotide  turnover,  as 

443 

shown  in  vivo  by  FRAP  (Stricker  et  al.,  2002)  might  also  ensure  the  ring  never 

444 

reaches  a  highly  condensed  state  and  FtsZ  monomer-sequestering  inhibitors  such  as 

445 

SulA remain able to stop the process at any time (Chen et al., 2012). However, it has 

446 

been  reported  that  the  GTP  hydrolysis-deficient  FtsZ(D212G)  mutant  generates 

447 

prominent constrictions of tubular liposomes in vitro (Osawa and Erickson, 2011) and

FtsZ-ring                                                                                                Szwedziak 2014 

448 

functions in cell division in  E. coli (Bi  and Lutkenhaus, 1992;  Osawa and Erickson, 

449 

2006; Trusca et al., 1998). Furthermore, the use of non-hydrolysable GTP analogues 

450 

did  not  impair  the  formation  of  condensed  FtsZ  structures  on  mica  (Hörger  et  al., 

451 

2008). Taken together with our result that constriction of liposomes may in principle 

452 

be  independent  of  GTP  hydrolysis,  these  data  question  the  alternative  idea  of  force 

453 

generation  by  filament  bending  upon  GTP  hydrolysis  as  has  been  suggested 

454 

previously  (Erickson  et  al.,  2010;  Li  et  al.,  2013;  Lu  et  al.,  2000).  We  suggest  that 

455 

nucleotide  binding/hydrolysis  is  required  solely  for  filament  growth/shrinkage  as 

456 

these are essential to maintain the dynamic state of the FtsZ ring in cells. 

457 

Taken  together,  we  envisage  that  in  vitro  liposome  constrictions  and  in  vivo  cell 

458 

division  quite  possibly  utilise  a  different  set  of  energetic  drivers  (a-c);  for  example, 

459 

GTP  hydrolysis  was  not  required  in  vitro  but  clearly  plays  a  role  in  vivo.  And  of 

460 

course,  it  is  likely  that  cell  wall  synthesis  in  the  periplasm,  guided  by  the  Z-ring 

461 

through the divisome, provides additional force in cells. So far, wall-less bacterial L-

462 

forms have not shed light on this interdependence of cell wall synthesis and the FtsZ 

463 

ring  since  artificial  L-forms  were  found  to  divide  by  blebbing,  most  likely  a 

464 

mechanisms that is not actively supported by cellular machinery (Leaver et al., 2009). 

465 

FtsZ-based cell division is not functioning in these L-forms and we suggest this may 

466 

be  because  L-forms  are  too  large  for  Z-rings  to  close  given  the  amounts  of  FtsAZ 

467 

present. 

468 

How to perform abscission? 

469 

The  described  FtsZ  filament  arrangement  might  also  provide  a  solution  to  the 

470 

abscission  problem:  how  do  the  membranes  fuse  at  the  end  of  division  when  the 

471 

protein  filaments  are  in  between?  Figure  5D,  middle  shows  how  an  intermediate 

 

 

21 

FtsZ-ring                                                                                                Szwedziak 2014 

472 

between the rings and the domes (as is present in the liposome constriction shown in 

473 

Figure 4A, bottom right and Movie M9) may explain abscission, since the protein ring 

474 

would  normally  be  in  the  way  of  membrane  fusion/fission  at  the  end.  The  change 

475 

from  a  flat  band  of  filaments  towards  the  helical  spirals  enables  inward  force  to  be 

476 

developed  on  each  side  of  the  constriction,  with  a  helical  spiral  on  each  side.  The 

477 

spirals observed in the dome-like structures might even be remnants of such liposome 

478 

abscission events, although we have no evidence for this (Figure 5D, right). It remains 

479 

to  be  seen  if  FtsZ  is  involved  in  final  abscission  since  it  has  recently  been  reported 

480 

that FtsZ might leave the septum earlier (Söderström et al., 2014). 

481 

Similarities to other membrane remodelling systems.  

482 

It  is  important to  mention that  membrane constriction with  ESCRT-III  and dynamin 

483 

filaments has also been suggested to involve sliding helical filaments (Guizetti et al., 

484 

2011;  Roux  et  al.,  2006)  and  similar  arrangements  to  those  depicted  in  Figure  5D, 

485 

right were predicted for the ESCRT-III system (Fabrikant et al., 2009).  

486 

Finally, our reconstitution of cell division can easily be adapted to include other  cell 

487 

division  proteins,  such  as  the  division  site  selection  mechanism  MinCDE,  nucleoid 

488 

occlusion,  FtsZ  cross-linkers  such  as  ZapA  and  many  more  middle  and  outer 

489 

divisome components.

Experimental Procedures: 

492 

Plasmids and strains 

493 

Plasmids  used  in  this  work  are  listed  in  Supplementary  File  1A.  E.  coli  DH5α  was 

494 

used  for  cloning.  Caulobacter  crescentus  NA1000/CB15N  and  E.  coli  B/r  H266 

495 

(Trueba and Woldringh, 1980) were used for cellular electron cryotomography.  

496 

Cellular tomography sample preparation 

497 

Caulobacter crescentus was grown overnight in PYE medium at 30°C. The overnight 

498 

culture was used to inoculate 50 ml of M2G medium. The culture was grown at 30°C 

499 

until  the  OD  reached  0.5.  11  µl  of  this  culture  were  mixed  with  1  µl  of  protein-A 

500 

conjugated  to  10  nm  gold  beads  (CMC,  Leiden)  and  applied  to  freshly  glow-

501 

discharged  300  mesh  Cu/Rh  Quantifoil  (3.5/1)  grids.  The  grids  were  plunge  frozen 

502 

into liquid ethane using a FEI Vitrobot (Mark IV) and stored in liquid nitrogen. 

503 

E. coli cells (some containing relevant plasmids, for FtsZ mutant co-expression with 

504 

endogenous wild-type FtsZ, Supp. Table 1 & 2) were grown at 30˚C in M9 minimal 

505 

media supplemented with 0.4 % glycerol until log-phase. Cells were then diluted into 

506 

fresh  M9  media  with  0.02  %  arabinose  (where  needed,  final  concentration),  and 

507 

grown for 1-2 hours for FtsZ mutant protein expression.  

508 

Lipid monolayer assay 

509 

Thermotoga maritima FtsZ (TmFtsZ) and FtsA (TmFtsA) proteins were purified and 

510 

2D  monolayers  were  prepared  as  described  previously  (Szwedziak  et  al.,  2012), 

511 

taking extra care and verifying by ESMS that the C-terminal tails of both protein were 

512 

intact  after  purification  as  they  are  prone  to  proteolytic  cleavage  as  this  was  not 

513 

obvious from gels, sometimes.

In vitro reconstitution of TmFtsZ and TmFtsA outside liposomes 

515 

20 μl of E. coli total lipid extract (Avanti Polar Lipids, US) chloroform solution at 10 

516 

mg/ml  was  dried  in  a  glass  vial  (Wheaton,  New  Jersey,  US)  under  a  stream  of 

517 

nitrogen  gas  and  left  overnight  under  vacuum  to  remove  traces  of  the  solvent.  The 

518 

resulting  thin  lipid  film  was  hydrated  with  200  μl  of  TEN1007.5  buffer  (50  mM 

519 

Tris/HCl,  100  mM  NaCl,  1  mM  EDTA,  1  mM  NaN3,  pH  7.5)  containing  either 

520 

TmFtsA  at  20  µM  or  TmFtsZ  at  60  µM  or  both  proteins.  After  10  minutes  of 

521 

incubation at room temperature the solutions were sonicated for 1 minute in a water 

522 

bath  sonicator  and  then  2.5  µl  of  sample  was  plunge-frozen  onto  Quantifoil  R2/2 

523 

holey carbon grids (Quantifoil, Germany) using an FEI Vitrobot (FEI, USA). Samples 

524 

were stored in liquid nitrogen. 

525 

In vitro reconstitution of TmFtsZ and TmFtsA inside liposomes 

526 

50 μl of E. coli total lipid extract chloroform solution at 10 mg/ml was dried in a glass 

527 

vial under a stream of nitrogen gas and left overnight under vacuum to remove traces 

528 

of the solvent. The resulting thin lipid film was hydrated with 50 μl of TEN1007.5 plus 

529 

20  mM  CHAPS  (Anatrace),  and  shaken  vigorously  at  800  rpm  using  a  benchtop 

530 

Eppendorf shaker for 2 hours. The lipid-detergent solution was sonicated for 1 minute 

531 

in  a water bath sonicator.  Subsequently, 50 μl of TmFtsZ  (30 µM)  and TmFtsA (10 

532 

µM) solutions supplemented with 0.5 mM MgGTP or MgGMPCPP (Jena Bioscience, 

533 

Germany)  or  no  nucleotide  was  added  and  left  for  30  minutes  at  room  temperature. 

534 

Next,  the  mixture  was  gradually  diluted  within  10  to  20  minutes  to  600  μl  with 

535 

TEN1007.5  or  TEN1007.5  plus  nucleotides  (both  without  detergent)  to  trigger

Electron cryomicroscopy and cryotomography 

540 

2D  electron  cryomicroscopy  (cryo-TEM)  images  were  taken  on  an  FEI  TECNAI 

541 

Spirit TEM operating at 120 kV with a 2k x 2k CCD camera at a magnification of 42 

542 

k,  corresponding  to  a  pixel  size  of  0.25  nm.  For  electron  cryotomography,  samples 

543 

were  imaged  using  an  FEI  Polara  or  FEI  Titan  Krios  TEM  operating  at  300  kV, 

544 

equipped with a Gatan imaging filter set at zero-loss peak with a slit-width of 20 eV.

546 

direct  electron  detector  was  used  for  data  acquisition  with  SerialEM  software 

547 

(Mastronarde,  2005).  Cells  or  in  vitro  reconstituted  systems  were  imaged  at  a 

548 

magnification of 41 k, corresponding to a pixel size of 5.8 Å (with US4000), or at a 

549 

magnification of 26 k, corresponding to a pixel size of 4.5 Å (for K2) at the specimen 

550 

level. Specimens were tilted from approximately -60˚ to +60˚ (±65° for C. crescentus 

551 

cells) with a 1˚ increment. The defocus was set to between 8 and 10 µm, and the total 

552 

dose  for each tilt series was around 120 e/Å2 for in vitro reconstitution samples and 

553 

150 - 200 e/Å2 for cells.

558 

Fernandez, 2011; Chen et al., 1996; Kremer et al., 1996). Measurements of distances 

559 

between  structures  were  carried  out  within  IMOD.  Movies  showing  liposomes  were

634 

(H) Extending the C-terminal linker of FtsZ by inserting a linker sequence pushes the 

635 

filaments  further  away  from  the  IM  (distance  changed  from  16  nm  to  a  somewhat

variable 16-21 nm). 

637 

(I)  Replacing  the  C-terminal  FtsA-binding  sequence  of  FtsZ  with  a  membrane-

638 

targeting  sequence  (mts)  makes  FtsZ  directly  bind  to  the  IM  and  results  in  FtsZ 

639 

filaments closer to IM (distance changed from 16 nm to 10 nm). No cell constrictions 

640 

were observed with this construct. 

641 

(J)  Removing  the  C-terminal  FtsA-binding  sequence  of  FtsZ  renders  it  unable  to 

642 

maintain  a  fixed  distance  to  the  IM  and  FtsZ  filaments  were  observed  within  the 

643 

cytoplasm.

(K) Removing the C-terminal flexible linker of FtsZ makes it prone to form multiple 

645 

layers  of  filaments  that  form  complete  rings  or  helices.  Tomography  using  this 

646 

construct works better because it produces small minicells.

684 

Recruitment  of  TmFtsZ  by  TmFtsA  leads  to  the  formation  of  two  layers  (bottom

structures are slightly helical spirals of condensing TmFtsZ filaments attached to the

demonstrate  that  in  both  cases  the  TmFtsAZ  filaments  are  positioned  at  close  to

perpendicular with respect to the membrane (red symbols). However, the constriction

distances  match  well  CcFtsZ,  EcFtsZ  and  TmFtsAZ  in  vivo  situations  (Figures  1A,

750 

(D) Left: in the ring-like structures (black), force (red arrows) is perpendicular to the 

751 

membrane  (blue),  leading  to  constriction.  Middle:  during  constriction,  the  ring 

752 

develops  into  two  helical  spirals,  leading  to  forces  pushing  membrane  inwards,  and 

753 

this might explain how abscission is accomplished since membranes will presumably 

754 

not fuse while the protein filaments are in between (see  Figure 4A bottom right  and 

755 

Movie M9 for an example of this in liposomes). Right: the domes we observed do not 

756 

deform  liposomes  because  the  force  generated  is  almost  perfectly  tangential  to  the 

757 

membrane. 

758 

(E)  Constriction  force  generation  and  filament  sliding.  In  the  discussion,  three 

759 

different  energy  sources  for  constriction  are  listed:  maximising  filament  overlap, 

760 

repeat-mismatch  within  FtsA-FtsZ  copolymers  (Figure  4—figure  supplement  2)  and 

761 

filament  shortening  and  turnover  due  to  nucleotide  hydrolysis  by  FtsAZ.  While  it  is 

762 

currently  not  obvious  which  of  these,  or  if  a  combination  of  the  three  mechanisms 

763 

drives  constriction,  it  seems  clear  to  us  that  constriction,  at  least  in  the  liposome 

764 

reconstitution experiments, requires filaments to slide past each other as is depicted in

two  dimensions.  Since  also  unmodified  wild  type  cells  (Figure  1)  show  closed, 

766 

continuous  rings  at  division  sites,  we  would  assume  the  same  holds  true  in  vivo. 

767 

Filament  sliding  can  also  explain  the  spirals  on  lipid  monolayers  (Figure  3A)  and 

768 

spirals in the dome-like structures with liposomes (Figure 4A). The schematic drawn 

769 

is a simplification into two dimensions, of course, in vivo and in vitro FtsZ filaments 

770 

overlap  in  the  third  dimension,  forming  single-layered  bands  since  each  filament  is 

771 

anchored to the membrane.

orientations  of  cells  in  the  microscope  with  respect  to  the  tilt  axis  on  the  missing

790 

tomograms since the cell thickness stayed constant over the angular range. High tilts 

791 

of those perpendicular to the tilt axis did not provide any useful information since the 

792 

effective  cell  thickness  in  the  electron  beam  increased.  Shown  are  projections  along 

793 

the long axis of the cell. It is important to note that whereas the angle between the tilt 

794 

axis and the longitudinal axis of the cell is crucial in order to obtain high quality tilt 

795 

series, other factors such as cell thickness,  ice thickness and membrane invagination

progression affect the quality of the resulting tomograms significantly. Scale bar: 100

the membrane, this arrangement will lead to negative curvature. Hence, the intrinsic,

ring formation. A stereo view of the liposome marked with the black arrowheads in

Figure  4—figure  supplement  2.  A  mechanism  explaining  variable  intrinsic 

859 

FtsA:FtsZ  filament  curvature.  At  some  stages  of  constriction  the  ratio  of  FtsZ  to 

860 

FtsA in  the ring may be higher than one. Normally, there is around five times  more 

861 

FtsZ in cells than FtsA), therefore only a few FtsA molecules may be sandwiched in 

862 

between  the  IM  and  FtsZ  filaments  (which  form  more  easily  than  FtsA  filaments), 

863 

upper  panel.  As  curvature  increases,  the  mismatch  of  the  FtsA  (orange)  and  FtsZ 

864 

(grey) repeats (5 vs. 4 nm, respectively) makes it possible to add more FtsA since the 

865 

double filament 'wants' to bend. Full occupancy of both FtsA and FtsZ in the double 

866 

filament leads to a curvature of about 60 nm. This mechanism could be another source 

867 

of  energy  for  constriction  in  addition  to  or  alternative  to  the  condensation  energy 

868 

gained from filament overlap (mechanism b) in the discussion).

Movie  M1.  Tomogram  of  a  wild-type  C.  crescentus  cell  showing  tomographic 

879 

slices  parallel  to  the  longitudinal  axis  of  the  cell.  A  single  layer  of  dark  dots 

880 

corresponding to cross-sections of FtsZ filaments is clearly visible at a distance from 

881 

the  membrane  on  both  sides  of  the  septum.  The  missing  wedge  is  located  top  and 

882 

bottom.  The  distance  between  adjacent  filaments  highlighted  by  the  arrow  varies 

883 

along the z-direction. Corresponds to Figure 1A.
