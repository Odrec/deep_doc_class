Abstract
In one of his last publications, Peter Mair documented how party membership had declined substantially in virtually all
European democracies. As his collaborators on this piece, it seems pertinent that we take these findings as a point of
departure and discuss what they mean for our understanding of party democracy. After all, the collapse of membership
figures calls into question one of the central elements of our conceptualization of representative democracy, namely that
it is based on voluntary political participation within political parties. All authoritative typologies of political parties
consider the role of members to be one of their defining elements, although the cartel party most clearly envisages the
marginalization of party members by professional party politicians. The traditional organizational allies of political parties
(e.g. trade unions, organized religion) are subject to similar processes of erosion. In this article, we review the evidence
of the social anchorage of political parties and discuss how political parties and party democracy can survive in an age
where amateur politicians are becoming an increasingly rare species and parties are being transformed into
organizational vehicles for those to whom politics is a profession rather than a vocation.

Introduction

Comparative research has shown that in recent decades
party membership in European democracies has been in
marked decline. The numbers of party members are falling,
both in absolute terms and as a percentage of the electorate.
Parties are struggling to hold on to their membership orga-
nizations and are failing to recruit significant numbers of
new members. While Duverger (1954) expected a ‘conta-
gion from the left’ that would encourage parties across the
political spectrum to adopt a similar organizational struc-
ture to that of the mass party, the emergence of the ‘catch-
all party’ in the late 1950s and early 1960s (Kirchheimer,
1966) not only challenged this conception of the political
party as the representative of pre-defined sectors of soci-
ety, it underlined the temporary nature of the mass party
phenomenon. Katz and Mair’s cartel party thesis drew
attention to the next logical step: party members were
becoming increasingly marginalized within party organi-
zations, and large membership organizations served to
validate the ‘legitimizing myth’ of party democracy rather
than remain true vehicles of linkage between party elites

and society at large (Katz, 1990; Katz and Mair, 1995:
18). Arguably, this could not remain without consequence
for the abilty (and willingness) of parties to recruit mem-
bers let alone to hold on to them.

As parties started to appeal to the electorate at large rather
than aim to represent a specific class or social group, their stra-
tegies became more aggressive as they began to aim at simple
electoral persuasion rather than partisan mobilization. The
focus of party strategy changed from what Parisi and Pasquino
(1979) once defined as ‘the vote of belonging’ to ‘the vote of
opinion’. It was now voters and not committed adherents that
counted, even if these voters were free to turn elsewhere at the
following election. Furthermore, parties shifted from a ‘bot-
tom-up’ to a centralized ‘top-down’ party structure, wherein

Party Politics

party elites play an increasingly important role at the expense
of ordinary party members. The traditional, almost exclusive
reliance of mass parties on specific collateral (religious or
trade union) organizations was replaced by a more contingent
and instrumental relationship to a larger variety of interest
groups characterized by weaker and less regular party ties.

These changes in party organization were the result of a
process of ideological and organizational adaptation of the
earlier mass parties to the changing external context. First,
the post-war period was marked by significant changes in
the social structure underlying the party systems (Dalton
et al., 1984). Technological innovation and economic mod-
ernization significantly reduced the size of the working
class, and increased upward mobility blurred traditional
socio-economic boundaries, weakening the sense of collec-
tive identity based on the notion of class. Religious identi-
ties and practices were also subject to the erosion produced
by secularization. Second, there were major changes in the
resources that became available to parties, in particular the
access to modern techniques of mass communication and
the beginnings of the provision of public funding. Both fac-
tors facilitated a more top-down, catch-all approach and
created the opportunity for parties to bypass the traditional
mass party model. These changes in how parties financed
their activities resulted in a decrease in their reliance on
membership subscriptions and other popular forms of fund-
ing. Direct access to mass media outlets, and to television in
particular, enabled party leaders to appeal directly to the
electorate; offering the benefits of a direct linkage in place
of what previously was mediated by grassroots activists. Pol-
itics quickly became more professionalized (Panebianco,
1988); parties began to outsource key services to commercial
organizations and political consultants, policy experts and
spin doctors took over many of the tasks once performed
by volunteers or ‘amateur democrats’.

As a result, politics has become more and more about
the competition between professionalized party elites and
less about the mobilization and integration of socially dis-
tinct groups. Most voters no longer have any long-standing
partisan loyalties but have become free floating and
uncommitted; they are, in principle, available to any of the
competing alternatives. While the mass party was firmly
anchored within civil society, linking society with the state
through the intermediary mechanism of the party organiza-
tion, catch-all parties became autonomous from both soci-
ety and the state, and the cartel party was increasingly
absorbed by the state. As the process of party adaptation
has progressed, the linkage between parties and civil soci-
ety has progressively weakened. Indeed, over the past few
decades, Western European democracies have suffered
from growing popular withdrawal and disengagement from
conventional politics. This can be seen from the decreasing
turnout
increasing levels of electoral volatility,
weakening of party identifications, and increasing partisan
dealignment (Dalton and Wattenberg, 2000; Gallagher

levels,

et al., 2005: 288–296). This is perhaps most obvious in the
substantial decline in the number of party members.1 At the
turn of the twenty-first century, the average ratio of party
membership to the electorate across (old and new) Eur-
opean democracies hovers around 5 percent (van Biezen
et al., 2012; Mair and van Biezen, 2001; see also below).
In 1980, by contrast, an average of almost 10 percent of the
electorates of the older democracies was affiliated to a
political party, and at the beginning of the 1960s the aver-
age party membership ratio stood at almost 15 percent
(Katz et al., 1992). In other words, parties in contemporary
European democracies are clearly losing their organiza-
tional hold on society and their capacity to engage citizens
in the way they once did.

It should be emphasized that, while this trend is preva-
lent across old and new Europe, its manifestation is not
entirely uniform. First,
there is considerable variation
within countries. In The Netherlands, for example, there are
some parties that deliberately eschew membership – as is
the case of Geert Wilders’ Freedom Party (PVV) – and the
established mainstream parties (Social Democrats, Chris-
tian Democrats and Conservative Liberals) have seen a
consistent decrease in their memberships since the early
1980s. At the other end of the political spectrum, the
Socialist Party (SP) has recorded considerable membership
gains in recent years, more than doubling its membership
(from 25,052 to 50,444) between 1999 and 2009.2 Other,
mostly newly established, parties have also recorded
noticeable increases. On average, however, the gains have
failed to compensate for the losses, and the aggregate mem-
bership levels generally decrease on an annual basis.

While some of these fluctuations may be contingent upon
domestic political events, in other cases established parties
remain highly committed to the mass model of party organi-
zation, and thus to having real memberships (as opposed
to donor lists). The Italian Lega Nord offers a powerful
counter-example to the general trends in this regard; it delib-
erately seeks to build a tight-knit and highly disciplined mass
organization modelled after the former Italian Communist
party (Albertazzi and McDonnell, 2010). German parties
also remain committed to high levels of party member-
ship; this is in part due to the fact that state subsidies are
contingent upon their ability to generate membership con-
tributions. In this sense, the story within the individual
European polities is far from uniform.

To a certain, though lesser, extent, this is also true for
the comparison between individual countries. Although
the general trend is unmistakably one of reduced mem-
bership organizations overall, the rates of decline are
much higher in some countries than in others. In addi-
tion, it is also possible to see the aggregate membership
levels of individual countries oscillate on an annual
basis due to the opposing trends in the memberships
of individual parties. This suggests that the downward
trend is not necessarily linear. Nonetheless, in the long

run, as we will see in more detail below, there are but
few exceptions to the overall downward trend. This
raises serious questions concerning the viability of party
democracy, which necessitates that parties provide a
meaningful, substantive link between rulers and ruled
(Sartori, 1976: 25). After all, the viability of this link
depends, to a substantial degree, on the viability of par-
ties as organizations with an active membership.

To be sure, parties might be able to compensate for the loss
of membership by relying on the linkage function provided by
other social organizations with which they have been tradi-
tionally allied. In the first instance, this would apply to the tra-
ditional cleavage-based organizations, of which trade unions
and organized religions have been the most influential.3
Clearly, there are other less formalized ways of linking parties
to society, most notably through new social movements and
the media. However, from an organizational perspective
these connections are different, since they do not facilitate a
structured exchange between party elites and organizational
elites, who can claim to represent a considerable and reason-
ably stable segment of society (Poguntke, 2000, 2005a).

This article reviews the available evidence on the most
important membership-based linkages between party elites
and mass publics, namely party membership itself (i.e. the
strength of the party on the ground) as well as trade unions and
organized religion, which have historically been the most
powerful allies of the major parties on the Left and on the
Right in Western democracies. Based on this, we discuss what
our findings mean for the future of party democracy.

Party membership: Figures and trends

In this section, we highlight the most important trends
regarding the development of party membership in European

democracies, which have been presented in detail elsewhere
(van Biezen et al., 2012). Figure 1 shows the change in mem-
bership as a proportion of the electorate (M/E ratio) for 19
European countries. The data series begins at various points
in time – mainly in the 1980s for Western Europe and for Cen-
tral and East European countries in the early 1990s – and ends
with the latest available data in the late 2000s. The most con-
spicuous finding is that of overall decline. Of course, there is
some variation in magnitude, and there are also exceptions to
the rule. However, there is an overwhelming tendency for
party membership in Europe to decrease. The magnitude of
this decline tends to be stronger in countries that have tradi-
tionally had a high level of party membership (such as Austria
and Norway), and it is more modest elsewhere, for example in
The Netherlands or Germany, which have always had com-
paratively low membership ratios (see for earlier data
Poguntke, 2000: 222–226; Van Haute, 2011). The downward
trend is similar in the post-communist democracies of Central
and Eastern Europe, where most parties, despite their rela-
tively short existence, record significant membership losses.
This demonstrates that in contemporary democracies, old and
new alike, the opportunity structure for political mobilization
has become largely unreceptive to mass organization. The
only country that unequivocally contradicts the trend is Spain,
a democratic latecomer; it is the only country that has seen its
party membership consistently grow since its transition to
democracy.

The general picture scarcely changes if we take another
look at this change over time; this time only the decade
starting in the late 1990s is examined (Figure 2). This
allows us to include a total of 23 countries for which data
have become available. Again, the overall picture is one
of decline, but with some more variation. Clearly, the rise
of new parties (as in Italy) or the re-configuration of old

parties is likely to reverse the trend, at least for a short
period of time. However, there is little indication that a gen-
eral reversal of the downward trend will occur.

This becomes even more obvious when we look at Figure 3,
which compares the annual rates of change during the
1980s and late-1990s and the most recent data beginning
in the late 1990s. In the majority of cases, the annual
decline has been less pronounced since the 1990s, suggest-
ing perhaps that the downward trend has begun to level out.
Having explored the trends, let us turn our attention to
the actual levels of party membership. After all, if we wish

to assess the meaning of these trends, we must also consider
the overall level of membership. A country in which party
membership has declined from 15 to 10 percent of the elec-
torate can still count on a large number of party activists,
while a country that has suffered an equal decline in percent-
age points but began with an M/E ratio of 6 would be left
with very few party members. Figure 4 clearly shows that the
vast majority of party democracies now have an M/E ratio
that rests below 6 (or is only marginally higher). Combining
all country data, our data show that the average membership
ratio in Europe is just 4.7 percent. Our findings are consistent

with those of survey-based analyses, which point to similar
patterns of disengagement from party politics (e.g. Scarrow
and Gezgor, 2010; Whiteley, 2011).

A wide range of membership surveys (e.g. Bruter and
Harrison, 2009; Spier et al., 2011) all reveal that a consid-
erable proportion (usually a clear majority) of these fee-
paying members does not seek an active role within the
party. This means that parties are increasingly confronted
with the serious challenge of finding a sufficient number
of credible candidates to ensure intra-party democracy. In
other words, it is highly likely that those who are internally
active in the political parties of European democracies also
hold intra-party or elected offices. Or, to overstate this
point somewhat, hardly any active grassroots members are
left in the parties to provide a linkage between party elites
and mass publics at large. However, the membership orga-
nization of political parties is but one organizational link-
age that is, in principle, available to party elites when
they wish to connect with their wider constituency. Histori-
cally, the major parties on the Left and on the Right have
relied on alliances with organized religion and organized
labour in order to stabilize their electorates. However, these
linkages have undergone similar processes of erosion, as
will be demonstrated in the following section.

Collateral organizations

While cadre parties have come to be regarded as a pre-
modern, pre-democratic variant, all later variants or types
of parties have usually been compared – often unfavour-
ably – to the ideal typical mass party model (Duverger,
1954; Katz and Mair, 1995; Kirchheimer, 1966; Neumann,
1956). When analysing party organizational strength in this
traditional sense, party membership has always been
regarded as the primary indicator. Despite familiar ambi-
guities and cross-national variation of the concept of

membership, it has always been seen as a fairly reliable and
valid indicator of the degree to which parties are anchored
in their relevant constituencies. Arguably, a party’s mem-
bership organization was the most reliable organizational
linkage party elites could create with their electorate.

Clearly,

it was not

the only linkage. Other forms
include a direct linkage through different types of media
of mass communication (including modern web-based
variants) or various forms of polling, as well as an orga-
nizational linkage through more or less exclusive connec-
tions to different forms of collective actors. Each of these
variants serves to inform party elites of the preferences of
their potential voters. However, direct linkages are largely
one-way (either top-down or bottom-up), while organiza-
tional linkages facilitate a two-way process of communica-
tion between party elites and mass publics that is mediated
through collective actors that perform a considerable propor-
tion of the relevant activities of interest articulation and
aggregation. While direct linkage functions through an act
of individual party support offered in exchange for elite
responsiveness, organizational linkage is articulated through
an exchange between party elites and organizational elites
who can mobilize or withdraw the support of their organiza-
tion (Poguntke, 2005a: 45).

From this perspective, a party’s membership organization
is merely a special variant of the organizational linkage
between party elites and relevant segments of the electorate.
After all, party elites need to bear in mind the preferences of
relevant factions of their own membership organization and
secure their support through the negotiation of policy con-
cessions with faction leaders. More or less formalized and
exclusive ties between political parties and relevant collec-
tive actors can therefore be conceptualized as an ‘extension’
of the parties’ membership organizations insofar as these
organizational linkages can, in principle, perform the same
tasks as the membership organization proper. From this

perspective, parties could, at least in principle, compensate
for the erosion of their membership organizations by
strengthening their links to collective actors. This point is
reinforced by empirical analyses, which have shown that
political parties have been capable of stabilizing their elec-
toral support by increasing the stability of their ties to collec-
tive
relevant organizational
environment. Obviously, parties can rely on the mobilizing
support of such organizations in exchange for making spe-
cific policy concessions (Poguntke, 2005a).

actors who form their

However, the capacity of collective actors to enter into
such stable exchange relationships varies widely depending
on the degree of their formal organization. This is why we
focus here on traditional collateral organizations, which are
hierarchically organized, are led by stable elites, and have
therefore traditionally been able to provide reliable anchors
for stable exchange relationships with political parties.
New social movements, on the contrary, are less structured
internally and the political mandate of elite positions tends
to be precarious, which makes stable exchange relation-
ships between political parties and new social movements
elites unlikely. Furthermore, forming linkages through new
social movements is highly contingent on mobilization
cycles and is characterized by what are often temporary
alliances between movement and party elites (Neidhardt,
1985; Neidhart and Rucht, 1993; Poguntke, 2005a: 48 f.).
Two sets of collateral organizations are relevant here.
The first – the affiliated or ancillary variants of sub-
organizations – is characterized by a partial or even com-
plete membership overlap with a specific party (Poguntke,
2005b). Typically, membership in a party’s youth or
women’s organization either requires membership in the
respective party or makes this very likely. Hence, the orga-
nizational development of such sub-organizations is largely
captured by the trends in party membership. The second –
the mass organizations – is either fully independent of
political parties or maintains corporate links with them
(e.g. through collective membership). These organizations
maintain permanent exchange relationships with a party (or
a political camp) but rarely formalize these ties. Therefore,
these collateral mass organizations must be treated as sep-
arate units of analysis. Corporate links through collective
membership and ex officio seats in party executives have
always been the exception rather than the rule, and were
often abolished or modified in the 1980s and 1990s (see, for
example Allern, 2010; Allern and Bale, 2012; Sva˚sand,
1992; Webb, 1992). Hence, the most straightforward indi-
cator for the strength of linkage through collateral organi-
zations is provided by the trends in their organizational
memberships. The electoral and more general political
effectiveness of agreements between party and organiza-
tional elites depends to a considerable degree on the num-
ber of organizational members that can be mobilized in
favour (or against!) a specific party. That said, a detailed
analysis of
these

the membership developments of

collective actors goes beyond the scope of this article, and
thus we have chosen to review some of the general trends
and patterns instead. In fact, as will quickly become appar-
ent, the trends are similar to those that are found for the
membership organization of political parties.

Trade unions

Table 1 gives OECD data on the development of trade
union membership in 22 countries. Combining survey data
with official records, the table reports the ratio of wage and
salary earners who are trade union members to the total
number of wage and salary earners, and hence the figures
are comparable to the M/E ratios for party membership.
It shows quite clearly that trade union membership has
undergone a similar decline to that of party membership in
the vast majority of countries. In all but five countries, trade
union density at the end of the first decade of the new mil-
lennium was lower than it had been in 1970 (or a decade later
in the case of Spain and Portugal). Only in Spain, which also
showed a divergent trend in terms of party membership
development, as well as four smaller European countries
(Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Belgium) has a deviation
from this otherwise universal pattern been verified (see
Table 1). The fact that it is the trade unions that administer
the unemployment insurance in these latter four countries
may create a selective incentive in their favour (Ebbinghaus,
2003: 195). While the data reported in Table 1 cover a rela-
tively long period of time, a closer look at more recent devel-
opments shows that the effect of such selective incentives
seems to have worn off. In 2005/06 trade union density was
lower than it had been 10 years earlier in all EU-27 countries
except Malta (Eurofound, 2008).

Most certainly, and as is the case of party membership,
there are substantial differences in the unionization levels
of each country. Union density has declined particularly
rapidly in the post-communist transition countries; this is
a result of the shift from (more or less) compulsory to vol-
untary union membership. In addition to the more general
erosion of the organizational hold trade unions have across
the board, there are also clear indications that they have lost
much of their capacity to integrate politically (Streeck,
1987). In some cases, the privileged relationships between
political parties and trade unions may even have turned into
a mutual liability; though some detailed analyses also show
that coordinated action and joint gains are still possible
(Allern, 2010).

Although we have only a limited number of measure-
ment points (four) for party membership ratios in a suffi-
ciently large number of countries, a regression analysis
shows that there is a fairly substantial positive correlation
between the development of trade union density and party
membership (0.36, significance 0.01) (Figure 5). This
clearly demonstrates that membership trends in parties and
unions are interconnected and that the phenomenon of

countries, particularly in the Protestant North and some
post-Communist countries. The larger Catholic nations and
Ireland still tend to have higher levels of formal religious
practice (Pollack, 2002). However, there is no measure of the
large denominations that is equivalent to trade union density
or party membership; formalized church membership does
not exist in many countries.4 Therefore, we rely on survey evi-
dence that measures subjective religious orientations even if
this captures the subjective rather than the organizational
dimension and hence is not fully comparable to our member-
ship data. Yet, if we wish to create a broader picture of the
extent of the decline of organizational politics, this is the best
available measure of the reach of organized religion. When
asked whether they consider themselves to belong to a reli-
gion, a declining share of the population in European coun-
tries reports a subjective belonging to one of the traditional
‘state denominations’ (Catholic, Protestant), while there is a
modest increase with regard to Orthodox believers (Figure 6).
A more detailed look at the results for individual countries
(Table 2) shows that this is indeed a universal pattern; the
sense of belonging to one of the two large Christian denomi-
nations has declined everywhere. While there are differences
in magnitude, only three results really stand out. There has
been no noticeable decline in Portugal and Austria; in the lat-
ter, party membership also remains very high. East Germany
is by far the most secular ‘unit’ in our analysis, wherein less
than a quarter of the population considers itself to belong to
one of the big religious denominations.

Interestingly, the results for the ‘none’ category are not
simply a mirror image of the decline in the numbers belonging
to state religions. In several countries, the share of people who
do not belong to any Christian religious denomination has
also declined; this may largely be attributed to the growth
in the percentage of Muslims in many European countries.

Overall, our results demonstrate that, where data are
available, the sense of belonging to one of the two large
Christian denominations has declined considerably. Yet,
these figures do not tell the full story. In fact, survey-based
evidence on religious orientation (religiosity) may be a rela-
tively poor indicator of the remaining political effectiveness
of the church hierarchy, because even the faithful are
increasingly unwilling to accept or even obey political gui-
dance by church leaders (e.g. Jagodzinski and Dobbelaere,
1995a, b). A striking example of this declining organiza-
tional clout may be found in Poland, where religious practice
is still exceptionally high and yet the church hierarchy has
frequently lost political battles (Ka-Lok Chan, 2000).

Significance of mass membership in
modern politics

The example of Poland suggests that the significance of
membership figures (formal or based on functional equiva-
lences such as church attendance or sense of belonging) as
an indicator of the social power of organizational elites is
itself in decline. In other words, not only are these (loosely
defined) organizational memberships lower than before,
they are also less formidable in terms of sources of collective
action. In an age of increasing pluralization of the social fab-
ric of Western societies, organizational membership may
therefore prove less telling as an indicator of identification
with a certain segment of society. Instead, it may simply

be based on selective incentives or a selective agreement
with the organizational goals in a narrower sense. A trade
union member, to use an obvious example, may still be pre-
pared to pay trade union dues because strong unions
make pay rises more likely. However, this does not mean
that the member shares the more general political philosophy
of the trade union leadership or feels part of the wider party–
union ideological nexus. It seems that just as parties have
evolved into organizations that exist and act ever more inde-
pendently of their social anchorage, so too have many other
mass organizations. Their continued political clout may no
longer depend so much on the number of troops they can
mobilize. Instead, their power may flow from their integra-
tion into the rules and rituals of a country’s political process
and from their inclusion into decision-making arenas.

It follows that a considerable element of interest represen-
tation in party politics is largely based on past experience
and on the related symbolic significance that the public
attaches to certain organizations. In other words, this ele-
ment may be path-dependent. Given that membership of
mass organizations is losing its significance as an indicator
of social reach, it then becomes difficult to judge whether
a party really needs good relations with the church hierarchy
or trade union leaderships, for instance. Such organizations
may have become symbolic actors and may no longer be real
forces for mobilization. As long as trade unions continue to
stand for social justice in the collective mind’s eye, their
opposition may be harmful for a Social Democratic party,
even though the majority of social democratic voters are
no longer trade union members. Similarly, to criticize the
Pope could be risky for a Christian Democratic leader even
in an age when the churches are relatively empty. To use a
particularly conspicuous and relatively recent example from
Germany, alienating refugee organizations still spells trouble

for the CDU regardless of the fact that the vast majority of
WWII refugees have already passed away.

It follows from this that we may be seeing parallel
trends. Organizational membership is declining as a result
of social pluralization, which, in turn, also means that the
significance of membership as an expression of collective
identity is waning. While some mass organizations may
be able to maintain a satisfactory level of membership
as a result of selective incentives (e.g. trade unions), oth-
ers may persist because of tradition (churches) or simply
because they have transformed themselves into professio-
nalized lobbies for whatever cause (e.g. the German refu-
gee organizations); this is not unlike NGOs that belong to
the new social movement sector, and which rely on fun-
draising (and public subsidies) rather than membership
contributions (Jordan and Maloney, 1997).

While mass organizations continue to be electorally
important for political parties, their blackmail potential
vis-a`-vis the parties has become increasingly independent
of their ability to recruit large numbers of members.
Instead, the power resources of mass organizations have
begun to resemble those of the political parties themselves
and have come to rely on their ability to raise funds
(including from the public purse), to employ a highly pro-
fessionalized staff, and to engage the resources of profes-
sional lobbyists and campaigners. Politics in this scenario
becomes a battle between groups of professionals who
claim to represent certain (ever more heterogeneous) con-
stituencies but who are no longer socially or organization-
ally tied to them. Clearly, this means that political parties
cannot compensate for the erosion of their membership by
maintaining or even strengthening their ties to collateral

Party Politics

organizations. This is because these organizations rely on
linkage to their social bases, which is no longer primarily
based on interest
intermediation through a structured
exchange relationship via mass organizations.

The same applies to political parties. Our analysis has
shown that parties and party elites can rely increasingly less
on the linkage function provided by their own mass mem-
bership. At the same time, the decrease in the numbers of
party members is a likely indication of a change in compo-
sition of party memberships. In a time when fewer individ-
uals feel attached to a certain subculture or milieu (and the
concomitant Weltanschauung), people are less likely to be
motivated to join political parties because of clear political
convictions. At the same time, the number of political jobs
that is controlled by parties has remained constant or has
even grown not only as a result of the popular demand for
‘more democracy’ but also the trend towards the decentra-
lization of political decision-making. Hence, career oppor-
tunities within the parties are on the rise; this is likely to
attract individuals who have an instrumental view of polit-
ical parties and view them first and foremost as a career
vehicle. In other words, and to use Panebianco’s simple
dichotomy, the proportion of believers is likely to shrink
while the proportion of careerists is likely to grow. There
are already membership studies indicating that
this is
indeed happening (Bruter and Harrison, 2009; Laux, 2011).

Conclusions

What does all this mean for the future of party politics? In
many ways, politics is becoming increasingly detached from
social constituencies as being a party politician has over-
whelmingly become a profession rather than a vocation that
is (also) inspired by a commitment to a cause, be it for rea-
sons of social background or ideological conviction. At the
same time, those who arguably act ‘on behalf of their consti-
tuencies’ are far less bound to these constituencies than they
were before because, as we have argued above, organiza-
tional anchorage through mass organization has waned.
Furthermore, and equally important, these constituencies are
themselves no longer what they used to be.

This raises several pertinent questions regarding the viabi-
lity of party democracy. First, because parties are increasingly
disconnected from society, they have greatly reduced repre-
sentative capacity. Although they continue to perform some
of their important linkage functions (e.g. Dalton et al.,
2011), it is also true that, as Rohrschneider and Whitefield
(2012: 31) note, as electorates come to consist mostly of inde-
pendents, choices become less sharply defined – this stems
from the political orientation of independent voters, which are
located closer to the ideological centre than partisans – and
salient
issues become more diverse. Party programmes
become more fragmented as a consequence, insofar ‘as the
social glue connecting parties and voters and defining a com-
mon set of interests vanishes’. This also implies that the

nature of representation is fundamentally changing. As Ande-
weg (2003) argues, representation typically presupposes the
existence of stable and meaningful social or political collec-
tivities, a condition that is progressively undermined by the
general trend towards individualization that can be observed
throughout Western Europe. The ensuing uncertainty regard-
ing citizen preferences coupled with the transformation of
political parties into parastatal agents has ensured that modes
of representation are shifting from ex ante bottom-up man-
dates to ex post top-down controls.

Michael Saward (2008) makes a similar point, arguing that
political parties may in fact (claim to) represent in a variety of
forms, and that what we are witnessing is a shift from one
form, the so-called popular mode, to another, which he calls
the ‘statal’ mode. The popular mode is characterized by parties
that claim to speak as delegates of certain politicized interests
on the basis of a relatively fixed ideology. This understanding
of representation involves a bottom-up process of interest
articulation and aggregation, and perhaps most deeply reso-
nates with dominant – but increasingly outdated – concep-
tions of party democracy. The statal mode is characterized
by parties that claim to speak as the trustees of depoliti-
cized and relatively flexible issue-based positions. This
mode of representation is more top-down and accentuates
the public rather than the private functions of parties.
According to Saward, such a transformation in the mode
of representation is not necessarily less democratic; it is
simply differently democratic (Saward, 2008: 283).

However, as this shift entails a transformation from a par-
tisan mode of representation to a mode of representation that
centres more explicitly on some notion of the general or pub-
lic interest, representation becomes practically non-partisan
(or, at any rate, distinctly less partisan). Peter Mair, there-
fore, considered this U-turn in the mode and direction of
representation, whereby ‘the parties have moved from repre-
senting the interests of citizens to the state, to representing
the interests of the state to its citizens’ (Mair, 2009: 6), to
be decidedly more problematic, if only for the legitimacy
of the parties as vehicles of political representation. Indeed,
many democratic polities are already experiencing a variety
of forms of opposition – from within and without the elec-
toral and parliamentary arenas, and from left to right – to the
established parties and political elites, which challenge their
lack of representativeness or responsiveness.

Perhaps, in the age of modern democracy we simply no
longer need the traditional organizational anchorage of
party politicians. As Saward observes, whether or not
democracy is unthinkable save in terms of political parties
may no longer be the right question to ask. Instead, we may
need to ask: ‘what kinds of representative democracy are
thinkable. And what forms of party [ . . .], if any, are appro-
priate to them?’ (Saward, 2008: 284). Increasingly, when
citizens wish to make their voices heard, they are more
likely to turn to interest groups, advocacy coalitions or the
media than to political parties. In the past, interest groups

tended to operate more under party aegis, as a complement to
the more established partisan channels. In contemporary poli-
ties, however, interest groups operate quite independently of
the parties, and in many ways offer an alternative, if not
directly challenge, to the process of interest intermediation
provided by parties. In this sense, parties have become more
isolated and more removed from societal demands. At the
same time, we are witnessing the development of various
grassroots alternatives to traditional partisan mobilization,
which are sometimes fuelled by social media networks. There
is a growing interest in forms of direct, participatory and
deliberative democracy that aim to give ordinary citizens
more influence over the political process that falls outside the
traditional and hierarchical partisan channels. Although they
are as yet unlikely to offer a viable substitute to traditional
party politics, they may come to complement the conven-
tional vertical and hierarchical modes of politics within an
increasingly horizontalized society.

Notes

1. Our analysis is based on data on direct, individual members;

for details, see Mair and van Biezen (2001: 6 f.).

2. Since then, however, its membership has started to decline,

recording 45,815 on 1 January 2013.

3. Note that there are other relevant organizations, such as farm-
er’s organizations, but we cannot discuss them here. Moreover,
they are not as universally important as the former two dis-
cussed above.

4. Membership of lay organizations, for which data are available in
some countries, would not be able to capture affiliation to the
churches insofar as this would require a much higher level of
commitment than is generally associated with church affiliation.
