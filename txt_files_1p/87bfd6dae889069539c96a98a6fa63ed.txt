Eukaryotic replication disrupts each nucleosome as the fork passes, followed by reassembly of disrupted nu-
cleosomes and incorporation of newly synthesized histones into nucleosomes in the daughter genomes. In this
review, we examine this process of replication-coupled nucleosome assembly to understand how characteristic
steady-state nucleosome landscapes are attained. Recent studies have begun to elucidate mechanisms involved in
histone transfer during replication and maturation of the nucleosome landscape after disruption by replication. A
fuller understanding of replication-coupled nucleosome assembly will be needed to explain how epigenetic
information is replicated at every cell division.

INTRODUCTION

Animals and plants develop from a single-celled zygote to a multicel-
lular organism with scores of different cell types that perform a multitude
of unique functions and yet carry the same genome. This diversity in
cellular identity during development and adulthood is achieved by dif-
ferential gene activation and repression in distinct cell types. Gene ex-
pression is influenced by nucleosomes, which mediate accessibility and
hence all biochemical activities on the genome. The overall inhibitory
role of nucleosomes on genomic access is modulated by posttransla-
tional modifications of histones in the nucleosome and the replace-
ment of canonical histones in the nucleosome by histone variants.
Thus, the pattern of differential gene expression that contributes to
cellular identity is reflected in features that differentiate nucleosomes
along the genome, the “nucleosome landscape.” The major histone
modifications classically associated with repressed chromatin domains
include H3K9 trimethylation (H3K9me3), which is found in consti-
tutive heterochromatin, and H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), which
is found in facultative heterochromatin. The major histone variants
include H3.3, H2A.Z, and the centromeric H3 variant, cenH3. In meta-
zoans, H3.3 and H2A.Z are broadly distributed throughout the ge-
nome, but are differentially enriched at particular regions including
actively transcribed regions, whereas cenH3 is rarely found outside
of centromeres.

The nucleosome landscape of different cell types is established in
large part through processes that disrupt and replace nucleosomes,
mainly transcription, chromatin remodeling, and replication. Exam-
ples of transcription and remodeling establishing the cell type–specific
nucleosome landscape include widespread transcription at enhancers
(1), remodeling (2), and nucleosome turnover (3) at Polycomb response
elements (PREs) in Drosophila, which are sites required for maintain-
ing cell type–specific transcriptional programs through several cell divi-
sions during development.

For eukaryotic development to proceed, the nucleosome landscape
must be reproduced by default in daughter cells after DNA replication,
which proceeds bidirectionally from origins bound by the origin recog-
nition complex. The replication fork consists minimally of the mini-
chromosome maintenance (MCM) helicase and DNA polymerase,
both of which are loaded at replication origins at the beginning of re-
plication, and the replicative processivity clamp, PCNA. The MCM
complex forms a channel around a single strand of DNA (the leading

strand of replication) and unwinds DNA in front of it (4). An MCM
channel translocating on single-stranded DNA will result in the com-
plete disruption of the nucleosome. Thus, over a few seconds of passage
of the helicase and the replication machinery behind, there is massive
disruption that dissociates the prereplication nucleosome landscape.

After the new strand of DNA is synthesized by the polymerase, as-
sembly factors reconstitute old nucleosomes and assemble new nucleo-
somes behind the replication fork. Because there is a doubling of genetic
material during replication, cells require double the amount of the ge-
nome packing material, namely, the histones. To provide sufficient
material at S phase, there is massive synthesis of the four canonical
histones, which form the nucleosome core that wraps 147 base pairs
(bp) of DNA, and the linker histone H1, which cements an additional
~20-bp DNA wrap to the nucleosome surface. Newly replicated chro-
matin must incorporate both the preexisting histones disrupted by the
replication fork and the newly synthesized histones. The main ques-
tions for elucidating the inheritance of nucleosome features during rep-
lication are as follows: How are old and new histones incorporated
during replication-coupled nucleosome assembly? How is the nucleo-
some landscape altered during replication?

Stable inheritance of epigenetic information through replication is
exemplified by cytosine methylation at CG dinucleotides in most
animals and plants. At CG dinucleotides, methylation is symmetric,
that is, the cytosine on both strands is methylated. At replication, each
daughter CG dinucleotide inherits one of the two symmetrically methy-
lated cytosines from the parental strand, base-paired to an unmethylated
cytosine on the newly synthesized strand, that is, a hemimethylated CG
dinucleotide. The Dnmt1 methyltransferase recognizes the hemi-
methylated CG dinucleotide and methylates the cytosine on the newly
synthesized strand. Thus, the methylation status of parental CG dinu-
cleotides is inherited by the daughter chromosomes through the hemi-
methylated state. In this review, we describe examples where
nucleosomes are “replicated” on the daughter chromosomes analogous
to cytosine methylation at CG dinucleotides, with the goal of delineat-
ing the underlying mechanisms.

NUCLEOSOME INHERITANCE THROUGH REPLICATION

To understand how nucleosomes are inherited through replication, we
need to first consider the constraints posed by the structure of the nu-
cleosome. The nucleosome core consists of the centrally located H3-H4
tetramer flanked on either side by an H2A-H2B dimer. Nucleosomal
DNA enters at the “proximal” H2A-H2B dimer and exits at the “distal”
