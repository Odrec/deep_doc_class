Cognition has a severely limited capacity: Adult humans can retain
only about four items “in mind”. This limitation is fundamental to
human brain function: Individual capacity is highly correlated with
intelligence measures and capacity is reduced in neuropsychiatric
diseases. Although human capacity limitations are well studied,
their mechanisms have not been investigated at the single-neuron
level. Simultaneous recordings from monkey parietal and frontal
cortex revealed that visual capacity limitations occurred immedi-
ately upon stimulus encoding and in a bottom-up manner. Capacity
limitations were found to reﬂect a dual model of working memory.
The left and right halves of visual space had independent capacities
and thus are discrete resources. However, within each hemiﬁeld,
neural information about successfully remembered objects was re-
duced by adding further objects, indicating that resources are shared.
Together, these results suggest visual capacity limitation is due to
discrete, slot-like, resources, each containing limited pools of neural
information that can be divided among objects.

Despite the remarkable power and ﬂexibility of human cog-

nition, our working memory—the “online” workspace that
most cognitive mechanisms depend upon—is surprisingly lim-
ited. An average adult human has a capacity to retain only four
items at a given time (1–3). This capacity is fundamental to
cognition: Individual variability in capacity is highly correlated
with ﬂuid intelligence (4–6) and patients with neuropsychiatric
disorders often have a reduced capacity (7, 8). Because it is so
basic to cognition, capacity limitation has been well studied in
humans (9), particularly the capacity limitation of visual short-
term working memory (for reviews see refs. 1 and 4). This work
has led to several competing theories about the neural basis of
capacity limitations. “Discrete” models suggest that capacity limi-
tations reﬂect a limit in the number of objects that can be simul-
taneously represented (3, 10, 11). “Flexible resource” models
predict that only the total amount of information available is
limited, with information divided among all represented objects
(12–14). It is also not clear whether the limitation is in stimulus
encoding or in maintenance (15).

To better understand the neural basis of capacity limitations
we simultaneously recorded from single neurons in the pre-
frontal and parietal cortex of two monkeys trained to perform
a typical human test of cognitive capacity: change localization
(Fig. 1A). Two arrays of objects (colored squares) were sepa-
rated by a short memory delay. In the second array, the color of
a randomly chosen object (the target) was changed. Monkeys
were trained to detect this change and make a saccade to it.
Cognitive load was increased by varying the number of objects in
the arrays from two to ﬁve. We recorded simultaneously from
multiple electrodes in the frontal cortex [lateral prefrontal cortex
(LPFC) and frontal eye ﬁelds (FEF)] and the parietal cortex
[lateral intraparietal area (LIP)]. These areas were chosen as
they are critical for short-term memory (16–19) and human
studies implicate them in capacity limitations (20–22).

Results
Like in humans, increasing the number of objects decreased per-
formance (84.8% correct with 2 objects to 66.5% with 5 objects,
Fig. 1B). The amount of information the monkeys had about

the objects in the array, calculated from their behavior (SI Mate-
rials and Methods), increased from 2 to 4 objects, but then satu-
rated, reﬂecting a limited capacity (Fig. 1C; 2 < 3, P < 10−15; 3 < 4,
P < 10−15; 4 < 5, P = 0.12, two-tailed permutation test). A capacity-
limited model ﬁtted the animals’ information signiﬁcantly better
than a simpler linear model (P = 0.026, validation test, see SI
Materials and Methods for details). Both monkeys’ capacities were
similar (3.88 monkey Sp, 3.87 monkey Si), with an overall average
of 3.88 objects [95% conﬁdence interval (CI): 3.82–3.93; SI
Materials and Methods]. In similar paradigms the capacity of an
average adult human is typically around 4 items (1).

Closer examination of the monkeys’ behavior revealed that
their total capacity was composed of two independent, smaller,
capacities in the right and left halves of visual space (hemiﬁelds).
Adding objects to the same hemiﬁeld as the target strongly de-
graded performance (Fig. 2A, rows), whereas adding objects in the
opposite hemiﬁeld had no impact (Fig. 2A, columns; ipsilateral
effect, P = 5.0 × 10−11; contralateral effect, P = 0.23; ANOVA).
The number of same-hemiﬁeld objects accounted for >95% of the
behavioral effect of the total number of objects. Behavioral per-
formance was not signiﬁcantly different between the two hemi-
ﬁelds, suggesting similar capacity in each hemisphere (target
hemiﬁeld effect, P = 0.74; ANOVA). The information the animals
had about each hemiﬁeld increased with a second object, but then
saturated, suggesting each hemiﬁeld’s capacity was ∼2 objects
(Fig. 2C; 2 > 1, P < 10−15; 3 > 2, P = 0.58, two-tailed permutation
test). Again, a nonlinear, capacity-limited model ﬁt signiﬁcantly
better than a linear one (P = 4.4 × 10−4, validation test). The es-
timated per-hemiﬁeld capacity was 1.6 objects (95% CI: 1.60–1.64;
capacity of 1.74 for Sp and 1.51 for Si, Fig. S1).

Neural activity also showed independent capacities for each
visual hemiﬁeld. For example, average object information in
LPFC neurons during the sample period decreased with increasing
number of objects in the same hemiﬁeld (Fig. 2D, Left), but not
the opposite hemiﬁeld (Fig. 2D, Right; ipsilateral effect, P = 1.4 ×
10−4; contralateral effect, P = 0.51; two-way ANOVA). We found
the same effect during the memory delay [ipsilateral effect (Ipsi),
P = 2.6 × 10−6; contralateral effect (Contra), P = 0.53; two-way
ANOVA] as well as in the LIP and FEF (Ipsi, P = 0.026 and P =
0.029; Contra, P = 0.52 and P = 0.19; two-way ANOVA; see SI
Materials and Methods for details). This result cannot reﬂect
attention to one hemiﬁeld or switching attention between them;
the monkeys could not predict which object would change and
performance was well above that expected from those strategies.
Is the brain’s capacity limit a bottom–up failure to perceptu-
ally encode objects or a top–down failure to retain objects in
memory? A perceptual encoding failure predicts that, when ca-
pacity is exceeded, object information is lost during neurons’
sensory responses and in lower-order before higher-order cortex.

Fig. 1.
(A) Task timeline. Animals ﬁxated (indicated by red circle) to start
trial. A sample array was presented for 800 ms, consisting of two to ﬁve
objects (ranging from zero to three in each hemiﬁeld). After a brief memory
delay (800–1,000 ms) a test array was displayed that was identical to the
sample, except one object (the target) had changed color. (B) Behavioral
performance decreased as the number of objects in the stimulus array was
increased. (C) The information the animal had about the entire stimulus
array (derived from behavioral performance) increased until four or more
objects were in the array, indicating the animal’s capacity was between
three and four objects. All error bars indicate 95% conﬁdence intervals.

A memory failure predicts a loss later (after encoding) and in
higher cortical areas ﬁrst. We found the former. Below capacity
(one object per hemiﬁeld), object information appeared in LIP
early after sample array onset [193 ms (95% conﬁdence interval,
149–229 ms); Fig. 3A], followed by LPFC [317 ms (249–359 ms);
Fig. 3B] and FEF [291 ms (249–339 ms); Fig. 3C, LIP < the
LPFC, P < 10−3; LIP < FEF, P = 0.003, randomization test],
consistent with a bottom–up ﬂow of sensory information from
parietal to frontal cortex. By comparing below- to above-capacity
activity, we computed the latency for information loss (Fig. 3,
compare blue curve to red/green curves). Information loss began
soon after array onset and immediately in LIP activity [191 ms
(139–249 ms); Fig. 3A, black square], earlier than in the LPFC
[341 ms (289–379 ms); Fig. 3B, black square] and FEF [658 ms
(599–709 ms); Fig. 3C, black square, LIP < LPFC, P < 10−3; LIP <
FEF, P < 10−3; LPFC < FEF, P < 10−3, randomization test]. In
fact, when capacity was exceeded (two to three objects per
hemiﬁeld), information in the LIP was weak and did not reach
signiﬁcance until after the LPFC and FEF (all P < 10−3, Fig. 3
A–C and SI Materials and Methods). Individual neurons showed
similar effects, with >85% of neurons selective in both below-
and above-capacity displays showing a decrease in information
when displays were above capacity (P = 4 × 10−8 across all areas;
Fig. S3 and SI Materials and Methods). Information loss above
capacity carried through the memory delay (Fig. 3 A–C, Right)
with the LPFC showing a further reduction of information for
three vs. two objects late in the delay (P = 0.047, randomization
test). One possibility is that this delayed difference between two-
and three-item displays reﬂects an unbounded (or less limited)
source of information available during sample presentation but
lost during the memory delay (e.g., iconic memory, ref. 2).

A limited capacity to represent multiple objects was evident on
a behavioral and neural
level. However, what is the neural
mechanism underlying this bottleneck? Two main hypotheses
have been put forth. First, objects could compete for encoding
within a limited number of discrete “slots”, with each object
being either successfully or unsuccessfully encoded (3, 10, 11).

(A) Behavioral performance (indicated by the color of the border/
background) for all possible stimulus displays. Adding objects to the same
side (ipsilateral) as the target (marked with a “T”) impaired performance
(rows), whereas adding objects to the other side (contralateral) had no ef-
fect. This result argues for separate capacities in each hemisphere. (B) Be-
havioral performance decreased as the number of objects ipsilateral to the
target was increased and (C) the information the animal had about the ip-
silateral stimulus array (derived from behavioral performance) increased
until two or more objects, reﬂecting the animal’s capacity was between one
and two objects in each hemiﬁeld. (D) Information was lost in lateral pre-
frontal cortex (LPFC) neurons over the sample period (100–800 ms after
stimulus array onset) as items were added ipsilateral to the encoded object
(Left). However, adding contralateral items (Right) had no impact on neural
information, matching the observed behavioral effects. All error bars in-
dicate 95% conﬁdence intervals.

Alternatively, capacity limitations could reﬂect a limited in-
formation “pool” that is ﬂexibly divided among objects, and so
adding objects reduces the information allotted to each encoded
object (12–14). Our behavioral and neural data suggest that the
two hemiﬁelds act like two slots. We tested whether encoding
was also slot-like within a hemiﬁeld.

A pure slot-like model predicts that encoding an object is all
or none: If successfully remembered, there should be an equal
amount of information about it regardless of how many other
objects are in the array. If an object is forgotten, there should be
no information about it. In contrast, we found that even when
a given target object was successfully encoded and retained, in-
formation about that speciﬁc object was reduced in all three
areas when another object was added to its hemiﬁeld (Fig. 4A,

rons in (A) the lateral intraparietal cortex (LIP), (B) the lateral prefrontal cortex
(LPFC), and (C) the frontal eye ﬁelds (FEF). Information about an encoded
object is shown when the object was presented alone (blue), with another
object (two total items, green), and with two other objects (three total objects,
red). The shaded region indicates SEM. (A–C, Left) Information is shown over
time for the sample period. The time at which information about the object
was above baseline is indicated for one, two, and three items as blue, green,
and red squares with associated lines depicting 95% CI. Information is lost in all
three areas when the stimulus array is above the animal’s capacity (i.e., in-
formation with two and three objects is less than with one object). Signiﬁcant
difference between one and two or three objects is indicated by black bars
(thin bars, P < 0.05; thick bars, P < 0.01). The time to ﬁrst signiﬁcant loss (P <
0.05) is shown as a black square at the top of each section, with horizontal lines
indicating 95% CI. We computed the neural latency for object selectivity as the
time of the steepest rise in neural information around when it ﬁrst became
signiﬁcant. This statistic is resistant to changes in statistical power, allowing for
comparison across areas (SI Materials and Methods). The timing of in-
formation loss (ﬁrst in LIP, followed by LPFC, and then FEF) suggests in-
formation is lost in a bottom–up manner. (A–C, Right) Information over early

of selectivity; Fig. 3). Further, when the change to an object was
not detected, it was not completely missing from neural activity:
There was still signiﬁcant information in LPFC neurons during
the presentation of the sample array (Fig. 4B, P = 0.0052, per-
mutation test), albeit signiﬁcantly reduced from correct trials
(Fig. 4B, P = 0.008, permutation test) that continued into the
memory delay (P < 0.001, permutation test).

Discussion
We report three main results. First, capacity limits were seen in the
initial sensory encoding and not as a memory failure. When ca-
pacity was exceeded, information was lost during the initial neural

response to the stimulus and in parietal before frontal cortex. This
result is supported by previous work showing that a subject’s ability
to attentively ﬁlter information is a major factor in their effective
capacity size (15, 23). It is also consistent with our second main
result of two independent capacities in the right and left half of
visual space. The bottleneck begins in posterior cortex where
neural receptive ﬁelds are more restricted to one hemiﬁeld than
in prefrontal cortex. Human studies report varying degrees of
hemiﬁeld independence (24–27). In our task, the need to localize
the changed object may emphasize this independence. Indeed, the
strongest evidence for human hemiﬁeld independence comes
from divided-attention tasks like multiple-object tracking (28, 29).
Discrete-resource models suggest that capacity depends on
a limited number of slot-like, independent resources (3, 10, 11)
whereas ﬂexible-resource models suggest a resource pool that
can be subdivided among items (12–14). Our results suggest both
mechanisms are at play. The two hemiﬁelds act like discrete
resources, whereas within a hemiﬁeld neural information is di-
vided among objects in a graded fashion. This model is sup-
ported by human psychophysical experiments indicating graded
information resources within slots (30, 31). It is also consistent
with observations that information about multiple objects mul-
tiplexes in PFC neurons as if the objects are shared among them
(32, 33). One intriguing possibility is that the neural mechanism
underlying the observed decay in information is similar to the
competition observed during inattention (34–36), although here
the animal’s task is to attend to and remember all of the stimuli.
The fact that contralateral stimuli had little impact on neural
representations (Fig. 2D) suggests an independence at the neural
level, possibly reﬂecting competition within contralaterally bi-
ased receptive ﬁelds (even in the lateral prefrontal cortex) (18,
37). Interestingly, parietal neurons seem to have a more severe
capacity limitation than frontal regions. Indeed, there were no
above-capacity responses until after activation of frontal cortex,
suggesting top–down inﬂuences may be needed to partially
overcome capacity limits. This ﬁnding also necessitates that in-
formation reaches prefrontal cortex from sources other than
parietal. An obvious candidate is the ventral stream, suggesting
further experiments are needed to fully understand the dynamics
of capacity limits throughout the visual system.

In sum, our results suggest that visual capacity limits result
from competition for encoding within independent, but limited
pools of neural information that can each be divided among
multiple objects.

Animals and Recordings. Two adult rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were
trained to perform a change localization task (Fig. 1A). After a short ﬁxation
period (500 ms) an array of colored squares was presented for 800 ms (the
sample period). A long sample period was chosen to ensure the animal had
enough time to fully attend to and process all of the items in the array.
Following the sample period the stimuli were removed for a memory delay
that ranged from 800 to 1,000 ms. A second array was then presented that
was identical to the sample array except the color of a single randomly
chosen object (the target) was changed. The animal was rewarded for
making a single, direct, saccade to it. Six new stimulus locations were chosen
each day, ranging from ±75 angular degrees from the horizontal meridian
and between 4° and 6° of visual angle (dva) from ﬁxation. Stimuli were
colored squares 1 dva on a side. Two colors were randomly chosen for each
location every day, preventing the monkeys from adopting any long-term
memorization strategies. An infrared-based eye-tracking system monitored
eye position at 240 Hz (ISCAN). Behavioral control of the paradigm was done
with the Monkeylogic program (www.monkeylogic.net) (38, 39).

Simultaneous recordings were made from single neurons in prefrontal
cortex (LPFC, 584 neurons; FEF, 325 neurons) and the parietal cortex (LIP, 284
neurons). All procedures followed the guidelines of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology Committee on Animal Care and the National Insti-
tutes of Health. Epoxy-coated tungsten electrodes (FHC) were used for re-
cording. Electrodes were lowered using a custom-built microdrive assembly
with 1-mm spacing.

Estimating Behavior Capacity. The animal’s behavioral capacity was estimated
using an information theoretic approach. This method fully accounts for
chance behavior and makes no assumption about the animal’s strategy in
solving the task. First, the animal’s information about each display was de-
termined from its behavioral performance (see SI Materials and Methods for
details). By combining these we could determine the information the animal
had about displays with a given total number of objects (Fig. 1C). Hemiﬁeld
information was determined by decomposing the total
information in
a given array into each hemiﬁeld’s display (SI Materials and Methods).
Again, this information can be combined for displays of a given size to es-
timate the animal’s capacity in each hemiﬁeld (Fig. 2C).

Neural Information About Stimulus Identity. We quantiﬁed the information
each neuron’s ﬁring rate carried about the identity (color) of each object in
the hemiﬁeld contralateral to the recorded hemisphere using a bias-corrected
percentage of explained variance (ωPEV) statistic (Fig. S2 and SI Materials and
Methods). To ensure our analysis was unbiased, all well-isolated neurons were
recorded and our analysis made no a priori assumptions about the structure of
color or location information in neural activity across time or display con-
ditions. We report all neurons that showed signiﬁcant information (i.e., object
selectivity) to any stimulus in the sample array (68 neurons in LIP, 189 neurons
in LPFC, and 97 neurons in FEF). Information was averaged across all selective
neurons and all attempted trials, unless speciﬁed otherwise (such as for the
correct or error-only trials, Fig. 4).

Timing of Information Loss. Two different latencies were of interest: When did
neurons ﬁrst encode information about a stimulus and when was this in-
formation degraded due to capacity limitations? For the former, we asked
when the amount of information in a neuron population signiﬁcantly
exceeded baseline. For the latter, we determined the latency of a signiﬁcant
difference in neural information between below- and above-capacity con-
ditions (e.g., one vs. two objects). For both measures we deﬁned the latency
as the time point of maximum rise in the difference function. The maximum
rise statistic was used as it is resistant to differences in statistical power: Vary-
ing the number of neurons in a population will change the threshold of
signiﬁcance, but will not a priori affect the shape of the function and
therefore will not change the point of maximum slope. The search for the
point of maximum rise was limited to a 150-ms window around the ﬁrst time
a signiﬁcant difference was found (e.g., 191 ms in LIP for greater information
in below-capacity trials compared with above-capacity trials). Uncertainty
about the time to signiﬁcance was determined by bootstrapping the pop-
ulation of neurons and redetermining the point of maximum slope.

SI Materials and Methods
Two male rhesus monkeys, Sp and Si, weighing 13 and 6 kg, re-
spectively, were trained on a visual working memory task (Fig. 1A).
All procedures followed the guidelines of the Massachusetts In-
stitute of Technology Committee on Animal Care and the Na-
tional Institutes of Health. Animals were prepared using standard
procedures (1, 2). Chambers were stereotaxically placed over
frontal and parietal cortices (in the same hemisphere), using
structural MRI scans. Unique software was developed in Matlab
that produced 3D models of each animal’s skull and brain in ste-
reotaxic coordinates. This method allowed accurate placement of
electrode penetrations into lateral prefrontal cortex, frontal eye
ﬁelds, and lateral intraparietal cortex simultaneously. Epoxy-
coated tungsten electrodes (FHC) were used for recording as well
as for microstimulation. Electrodes were lowered using a custom-
built microdrive assembly that lowered electrodes in pairs from
a single screw. The microdrive assembly was designed to allow for
a high density of electrodes (1-mm spacing) to maximize the
number of simultaneously recorded neurons across our three re-
gions of interest. The electrodes were acutely lowered through an
intact dura at the beginning of every recording session and allowed
to settle for a minimum of 2 h before recording. This process en-
sured stable isolation of the activity single neurons. After each
recording session, the electrodes were retracted and the micro-
drive assembly was removed from the well.

Spiking activity was recorded across a maximum of 50 elec-
trodes simultaneously. Both spiking activity and local ﬁeld
potentials were referenced to ground. The signal from each
electrode was divided into spiking activity and a local ﬁeld po-
tential by ﬁltering between 154 Hz and 8.8 kHz for spikes and
between 3.3 and 88 Hz for the local ﬁeld potential. Only spiking
data were analyzed for this paper. Waveforms were stored and
single neural activity was sorted from the raw spiking activity
signal off-line using a combination of principal component
analysis of waveform traces along with other properties of the
recorded waveforms (amplitude, trough/peak latency, etc). An
infrared-based eye-tracking system monitored eye position at
240 Hz. Behavioral control of the paradigm was handled by the
Monkeylogic program (www.monkeylogic.net) (3, 4). All analysis
code was custom written in Matlab or C.

Behavioral Task. The trial was initiated when the animal ﬁxated on
a point at the center of the screen. Fixation was required within
1.75° of visual angle (dva) of the ﬁxation point. After a short
ﬁxation period (500 ms), the animal was presented with an array
of colored squares for 800 ms. A long stimulus period was chosen
to ensure the animal had enough time to fully attend to and
process all of the items in the array. After the sample period the
stimuli were removed and the animal was required to maintain
ﬁxation for a memory delay that ranged from 800 to 1000 ms.
Following the memory delay, a test array was presented. The test
array was identical to the sample array except that the color of
a single stimulus was changed. The animal’s task was to make
a single, direct, saccade to the changed object.

Six new stimulus locations were chosen each day. There were
always three locations in each visual hemiﬁeld, ranging from ±75
angular degrees from the horizontal meridian and between 4 and
6 dva from ﬁxation. Stimuli were colored squares 1 dva on a side.
Two colors were chosen for each location every day. Both the
location and colors were changed each day, to prevent monkeys
from adopting any long-term memorization strategy. The colors
were drawn from a predeﬁned population of 14 colors in a ran-

dom manner as long as 2 colors were not too difﬁcult to dis-
criminate at a particular location (i.e., red and pink were never
paired). This process ensured a large degree of variety in the
stimuli used on a particular day and thus required the animals to
encode and hold in memory the array presented on each trial
and detect its change rather than memorizing ﬁxed stimulus-
response associations. The location of the target item (which
was the stimulus that ﬂipped from one of the color pair in the
sample array to the other in the test array) was chosen randomly
on each trial.

The total number of stimuli in the visual array varied from two
to ﬁve items on each trial. Early in training the number of total
stimuli in the array was chosen randomly. However, we noticed
both animals showed behavioral evidence of independent capacities
in each hemiﬁeld (Fig. 2). Anticipating the need to compare trials
with one, two, and three objects in a hemisphere, we then equalized
the number of trials in each of these conditions. Therefore, the con-
stellation of the stimuli used was pseudorandomly chosen such
that both the distribution of trials with one, two, or three items in
the target’s hemiﬁeld and the distribution of total number of stimuli
in a trial were ﬂattened. This process did not alter the probability of
the target location.

The animals performed a minimum of 720 correct trials during
recording sessions, ensuring at least 20 trials for each target, color,
and number of ipsilateral stimuli conditions. Both monkeys per-
formed the task well above chance and with similar capacities (Fig.
S1). Only trials during which the animal was consistently at-
tempting the task were used: Three of ﬁve trials in any given period
had to be attempted to be included. Nonattempted trials were
failing to initiate the trial or broken ﬁxation before the trial was
completed. For the main analysis (Figs. 2D and 3), all attempted
trials (correct or error) were used, regardless of the target location.
For correct/error analyses, only trials where the animal correctly/
incorrectly identiﬁed a change at a given object were used.

Estimating Information from Behavior. To understand how capacity
limitations are reﬂected in neural activity, we ﬁrst must estimate
the animal’s behavioral capacity. An information theoretic ap-
proach was used to fully account for chance behavior and make
no assumptions about the animal’s strategy in solving the task.
We were interested in knowing how much information the ani-
mal had about a given stimulus display. As the animal uses this
information to make its behavioral choice, this is equivalent to
asking how much information the animal’s choice gives us about
where the target is located: I(target; behavior) = H(target) – H
(target | choice), where HðxÞ ¼ − ∑N
i pðxiÞ × log2 pðxiÞ is the un-
certainty of x. The uncertainty of the location of the target, H
(target), was determined directly from the likelihood of the
target appearing at each possible location in the display (i.e.,
a ﬂat distribution). The uncertainty of the target, given the ani-
mal’s choice, was equal to the probability the target was at each
position given that the animal chose a particular location.

This process determines the information for a whole stimulus
array (Fig. 1C), but we were also interested in the information
the animal had about stimuli in each hemiﬁeld. The animal’s
behavior and neural activity showed the two hemispheres were
independent. Therefore, the information the animal had about
the overall display can be decomposed into the sum of the two
independent hemiﬁelds. This process allows us to estimate the
information for the display in each hemiﬁeld directly from the
total display: I(display) = I(left display) + I(right display). For
example, given a particular display:

As there were 56 unique total stimulus displays, and 8 unique
displays for the left and right sides, we can solve the set of linear
equations to estimate the information for each hemiﬁeld. These
estimates are then used to estimate the average information
given the number of stimuli in the hemiﬁeld (Fig. 2C and Fig.
S1B) and show that both animals had a capacity limit between
one and two items in each hemiﬁeld. Matlab code for using this
information theoretic approach to behavioral analysis is gladly
shared upon request.

Determining Whether Behavioral Information Was Capacity Limited.
To determine whether the information the animals had about the
display (Figs. 1C and 2C) was capacity limited we use a model
selection approach. The observed information was modeled with
both a linear curve, I = β1x + β0, and a capacity-limited curve,

I ¼ β1x þ β0; x < c
β1c þ β0; x ≥ c:

We compared the goodness-of-ﬁt using both a validation test and
the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). For the validation test
a randomly selected subset of the trials (70%) was used to es-
timate the parameters of each model in turn. The predicted values
from each model were then compared with the reserved trials to
measure the error in the model ﬁt. This process “validates” how
well the model captures the data without overﬁtting. By re-
peating this process multiple times a distribution of the differ-
ence in errors for our two models can be generated. The
validated errors for the capacity-limited model were signiﬁcantly
lower than those for the linear model for the information about
the total display (Fig. 1C, P = 0.026). This difference was even
greater for the ipsilateral information (Fig. 2C, P = 4.4 × 10−4).
Alternatively, one can use the BIC to test how well models ﬁt the
observed data while correcting for differences in the number of
free parameters (5, 6). As with the validation test, the capacity-
limited model was found to ﬁt better (have a lower BIC) for both
the total (BIClinear = −24.9, BICcap-lim = −31.0) and ipsilateral
displays (BIClinear = −17.4, BICcap-lim = −21.8). Both of these
tests conﬁrm that the capacity-limited model ﬁts the observed
behavioral data better than a simpler linear model, suggesting
the monkeys’ behavior was indeed capacity limited.

Estimating Capacity from Behavior. Although estimating the in-
formation available to the animal from their behavioral perfor-
mance fully accounts for chance levels and alternative strategies
it is difﬁcult to directly compare with previous human psycho-
physical work. Therefore, we also computed the capacity for each
animal using a behavioral model similar to that previously used in
human capacity limitation studies. The animals were modeled to
correctly remember c objects worth of information on a given
trial (their capacity). This limit was not necessarily discrete and
partial object information was allowed (e.g., 3.7 items). The
animals’ baseline performance was taken to be b to compensate
for ﬁxation breaks, periods of inattention, etc. Using these two
parameters, we modeled their likelihood of getting a trial correct as

pðnÞ ¼( b;

b

n ≤ c
c
n; n > c;

where n is the number of objects in the visual array (either within
a hemiﬁeld or across the entire visual scene depending on
whether we were estimating the hemiﬁeld or total capacity).
Conﬁdence intervals were estimated by a bootstrapping pro-

cedure: a new population of trials (from the >42,000 recorded)
was randomly selected (with replacement) and the parameters
were reestimated. Repeating this process 1,000 times resulted in
a distribution for each parameter from which 95% conﬁdence
intervals (95% CI) were determined. However,
it should be
noted that this model-based approach does not fully accommo-
date for alternative strategies (such as an exclusionary strategy)
or guessing. This problem is typically corrected in human psy-
chophysical work by subtracting the false alarm rate from the hit
rate (7), but this process becomes complicated when capacities
between hemiﬁelds are independent but guessing is not (as the
animal can make only one choice). However, our estimate from
this simple behavioral model is well aligned with the plateau
observed in the information theoretic analysis (which fully
compensates for any of these strategies), suggesting the animals
were not adopting a complicated behavioral strategy.

Recording Locations. A total of 50 electrodes were implanted into
parietal and frontal cortex simultaneously, up to 25 in each an-
atomical area. Data are presented from 28 sessions (14 each for Si
and Sp). A total of 1,334 neurons were recorded across all three
anatomical regions in two monkeys (339 from the lateral intra-
parietal area, LIP; 640 neurons from lateral prefrontal cortex,
LPFC; and 355 neurons from the frontal eye ﬁelds, FEF). We
chose to record from frontal and parietal cortex as both regions
have been implicated in working memory (8–11) and capacity
limitations (12–14). Furthermore, all three regions have been
previously shown to encode stimulus color, particularly when
task relevant (15, 16). A total of 540 neurons were recorded from
monkey Si and 794 neurons from monkey Sp. Similar behavioral
and electrophysiological results were obtained from each animal
alone (Figs. S1 and S2), so they are combined for presentation.
The LIP recording well was placed at ∼4 mm posterior from
the interaural plane and was placed using structural MRIs. To
identify LIP neurophysiologically, we trained the animals on
a delayed saccade task. During central ﬁxation, a brief spot of
light was ﬂashed in the periphery. After a memory delay, the
ﬁxation point was extinguished and the animal made a saccade to
the remembered location of the light spot. This has been used to
isolate LIP from surrounding regions, as it is the only region in
the parietal cortex that shows spatially selective memory delay
activity (17). The animals performed the delayed saccade task at
the beginning of every recording session. Electrodes were con-
sidered to be within LIP for that session only if a neuron isolated
from that electrode showed memory delay activity selective for
the remembered location (P < 0.05 using the ωPEV statistic).

The frontal recording well was placed at ∼32 mm anterior from
the interaural plane. Microstimulation was used to demarcate
the frontal eye ﬁelds from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. An
Isolated Pulse Stimulator (Model 2100; A-M Systems) was used
for electrical stimulation. Stimulation was delivered as a 200-ms
train of biphasic pulses with a width 400 μs and an interpulse
frequency of 330 Hz, using the same electrodes used for re-
cording. Current level was started at 150 μA and reduced to ﬁnd
the threshold at which an eye movement vector was elicited 50%
of the time. Only sites that had thresholds of stimulation am-
plitudes <50 μA were classiﬁed as belonging to the frontal eye
ﬁelds (18). Anterior sites were classiﬁed as belonging to the
LPFC. In general, stimulation at LPFC sites did not elicit eye
movements even at the highest current amplitude tested (150 μA).
For the analysis of the overall loss of information (Fig. 3), we
required each neuron’s activity to have been recorded for a
minimum of 30 trials for each object location. This restriction
yielded a population of 284 LIP neurons, 584 LPFC neurons,
and 325 FEF neurons. However, this requirement was relaxed to
15 trials for the correct-alone (Fig. 4A) and 5 trials for correct vs.
error (Fig. 4B) analyses, as these analyses required the analyzed
object to be the eventual target. In addition, only selective

neurons (assessed across all trials, see below) were used. This
restriction yielded 41 selective LIP neurons, 130 selective LPFC
neurons, and 67 selective FEF neurons included in the correct/
error analysis (Fig. 4).

Information from Individual Neuron Firing Rates. The factor of in-
terest was the color identity of each object in the array, which was
not known to the monkey before the trial began. The key question
was how neural information about color identity of the objects
changed as the number of objects to be encoded and remembered
was increased. We assessed selectivity for the identity of each
stimulus for each neuron using a percentage of explained variance
(PEV) statistic (for example, neurons, Fig. S2). The PEV reﬂects
how much of the variance in a neuron’s ﬁring rate can be explained
by the color identity of a particular stimulus. Typically, PEV is
expressed as η2, η2 ¼ SSBetween Groups=SSTotal; where SSTotal ¼
∑N
i ðxi − xÞ2 and SSBetween Groups ¼ ∑G
group ngroup ðxgroup − xÞ2: Un-
fortunately, for smaller sample sizes, the η2 statistic has a strong
positive bias. Therefore, for all of our statistics in this paper we
used the ω2 statistic (ωPEV),

SSBetween Groups − df × MSE

;

SSTotal þ MSE

ω2 ¼

where df is the degrees of freedom (i.e., the number of groups,
G, − 1) and MSE is
the mean squared error, MSE ¼
∑N
i ðxi − xgroupÞ2: ω2 is an unbiased measure (19), resulting in
a zero-mean statistic when there is no information (e.g., see
baselines of Fig. S2, Lower row). For this reason, and as ω2 is not
computationally expensive to compute, we prefer ωPEV over the
more prevalent η2 form. However, it is important to note that
although the mean of ω2 is unbiased, the distribution of observed
values still varies with the number of observations (i.e., the skew
of the distribution). Therefore, for all of our comparisons, con-
ditions were balanced for the number of trials in each group.
Balancing was accomplished by stratifying the number of trials in
each group to a common value: A random subset of trials was
drawn (equal to the minimum trial number across groups) and the
statistic was calculated. This process was repeated 25 times and the
overall statistic was taken to be the mean of the stratiﬁed values.
To determine whether and when the observed level of ωPEV
was signiﬁcantly different from chance, we used a randomization
test. The association between neural activity and stimulus iden-
tity was randomly shufﬂed and the ωPEV was recalculated. By
repeating this process 500 times a null distribution was con-
structed. The observed ωPEV was then compared with this null
distribution to determine the likelihood of the observed ωPEV.
The time course of ωPEV was calculated in windows of 100 ms,
slid every 10 ms. Neurons were independently tested for selec-
tivity within the sample period (0–800 ms from the onset of the
visual array) and the delay period (0–800 ms from the offset of
the visual array).

The signiﬁcance threshold for the amount of information was
determined for each window by dividing the typical signiﬁcance
threshold (P ≤ 0.05) by the number of comparisons made across
each window. A neuron was considered selective for object
identity if its likelihood reached this signiﬁcance threshold for
two independent windows of time (i.e., two consecutive 100-ms
windows). This process corrected for multiple comparisons
across time and reduced the chance that the selective responses
were due to nonphysiological anomalies.

As used here the ωPEV statistic makes one assumption:
Neurons encode stimuli by modulating their average ﬁring rate
within the analyzed window of time. Importantly, it does not
make any assumption about the consistency of neural response
over time or between displays of different sizes. The ωPEV
statistic allows us to take an agnostic approach to decoding in-

formation about stimulus identity in different conditions (and
across time), capturing as much of the selectivity as possible and
avoiding any bias across conditions.

Testing for Independent Hemispheres in Neural Activity. As noted
in the main text, we found behavioral evidence that the two
hemispheres of visual space had independent capacities. To
determine whether this effect extended to the neural level, we
determined the degree of object selectivity for neurons in LPFC,
LIP, and FEF for each display used (as shown in Fig. 2A). We
then determined the impact of adding objects to the ipsilateral
and contralateral hemiﬁelds, using a two-way ANOVA. As seen
in Fig. 2D, LPFC neurons showed a reduction in selectivity with
the addition of stimuli in the ipsilateral hemiﬁeld but not when
adding objects to the contralateral hemiﬁeld during the sample
period (100–800 ms after sample onset) and memory delay (100–
800 ms after sample offset). Similar results were also seen in LIP,
LPFC, and FEF for the time periods of interest highlighted in
Fig. 4 (150–350 ms for LIP, 300–800 ms in LPFC, 450–800 ms for
FEF; P values for LIP and FEF in main text; LPFC, ipsilateral
effect, P = 0.0011, and contralateral effect, P = 0.73).

Testing for Signiﬁcance on Neuron Population Level. We determined
when the amount of average object information across the neuron
population reached signiﬁcance (above baseline) by a nonpa-
rametric, paired, Wilcoxon signed rank test. As we examine only
neurons whose ﬁring rate carried signiﬁcant object information,
the population will necessarily be biased above zero. To com-
pensate for this bias, we chose the ﬁrst 50 ms as our baseline period,
averaged over all three conditions (i.e., ignoring the number of
stimuli in the array). As this time period fell within our time
window of selection, any bias due to selecting the neurons alone
was corrected. Furthermore, as our baseline is averaged across
all three conditions this process should not lead to any bias in
our observed timing differences for each condition (see below for
this procedure).

Signiﬁcant differences between below-capacity and above-
capacity conditions were determined using a randomization test.
Brieﬂy, the association between observed information (in a given
100-ms window) and the number of stimuli on the screen was
broken by randomly shufﬂing conditions. The average difference
in population information was determined for each random
shufﬂe. This process was repeated 1,000 times and the observed
difference in information was compared with the population of
randomized values to determine the likelihood of seeing our
observed value by chance. The ﬁrst time this likelihood fell below
5% for both 1 vs. 2 and 1 vs. 3 was taken as our time-to-ﬁrst
signiﬁcance. However, as this measure can be biased by statistical
power, we used a different statistic to measure the time to sig-
niﬁcant deviation: the point of maximum rise in the difference
function (below capacity minus above capacity). This statistic is
explained next.

Details of the Latencies of Neural Information. As noted in the main
text, the time point at which selectivity for the identity of an object
exceeded baseline depended on whether the displays were above
or below capacity. When the display was below the animal’s ca-
pacity (i.e., one object in the hemiﬁeld), object information ap-
peared in LIP at 193 ms after the onset of the visual array (95%
conﬁdence interval, 149–229 ms). LIP selectivity was followed by
responses in LPFC (317 ms; 95% CI, 249–359 ms) and FEF (291
ms; 95% CI, 249–339 ms). This result is consistent with a bottom–
up ﬂow of sensory inputs from posterior to anterior cortex (LIP <
LPFC, P < 10−3; LIP < FEF, P = 3 × 10−3, randomization test).
There was no signiﬁcant difference between the two frontal re-
gions (FEF < LPFC, P = 0.23, randomization test).

Information about the object’s identity was seen in the reverse
order when the display was above capacity (two or three objects

per hemiﬁeld): ﬁrst in LPFC and FEF, followed by LIP. Signif-
icance in LPFC occurred at 315 ms (95% CI, 249–339 ms) and
318 ms (95% CI, 259–359 ms) after visual array onset for two
and three items, respectively. FEF was at approximately the
same time: 322 ms (95% CI, 289–409 ms) and 290 ms (95% CI,
249–309 ms) for two and three items, respectively. Signiﬁcant
information about two or more objects was not observed in LIP
until 527 ms (95% CI, 439–549 ms) and 474 ms (95% CI,
399–539 ms) after the array onset. Information was signiﬁcantly
earlier in LPFC and FEF than in LIP (LPFC < LIP, P < 10−3;
FEF < LIP, P < 10−3, by randomization test for both two and
three objects). Again, there was no signiﬁcant difference be-
tween the frontal regions (LPFC < FEF, P = 0.49 for two items;
FEF < LPFC, P = 0.23 for three items).

This pattern of results suggests top–down input may be im-
portant for representing object identity information when the
visual array is above the animal’s capacity. Indeed, the difference
in selectivity in LIP was signiﬁcantly later in above-capacity trials
compared with below-capacity trials (1 < 2, P < 10−3; 1 < 3, P <
10−3, randomization test). However, there was no signiﬁcant
difference in the timing of selectivity for above-capacity con-
ditions in LIP (3 < 2, P = 0.09) or for any condition in either
LPFC (2 < 1, P = 0.38; 1 < 3, P = 0.35; 2 < 3, P = 0.38, ran-
domization test) or FEF (1 < 2, P = 0.48; 3 < 1, P = 0.30; 3 < 2,
P = 0.49, randomization test).

Loss of Information Between Two- and Three-Item Displays. The
shared resource hypothesis predicts that an information source
is divided among the objects currently remembered. Therefore,
information about a stimulus in a three-item display should
be reduced from when that stimulus is in a two-item display.
Whereas this pattern is seen late in the delay period for LPFC
neurons (Fig. 3B, Right), no signiﬁcant difference was observed
during the sample period. As noted in the main text, one in-
teresting hypothesis is that this difference in information loss
reﬂects a difference in capacity between these two time periods.
For example, when the stimuli are present (or were recently
present), the visual trace may provide a source of information
that is less limited (or even unlimited). However, this argument
extends from a negative ﬁnding (that there was no signiﬁcant
difference between two and three objects), making it difﬁcult to
interpret. As the expected difference in information per stimulus
decreases with added items (i.e., from 1 unit of information
compared with 1/2 and then from 1/2 compared with 1/3), our
ability to resolve the difference is reduced, possibly leading to an
inability to observe a signiﬁcant difference. However, this con-
cern is mitigated by the fact that we are able to resolve the dif-
ference late in the trial.

Loss of Information for Individual Neurons. The loss of information
above capacity is clear on a population level (Figs. 3 and 4). How-
ever, this loss either could be an effect at the population level
(e.g., differential recruitment of neuron groups) or could occur

for individual neurons. To investigate this we isolated neurons
that were signiﬁcantly selective (P < 0.05) for the same object in
both below-capacity and above-capacity displays. Although this
process greatly reduced the number of neurons in our population
(38 from LPFC, 13 from FEF, and 4 from LIP; Fig. S3), the large
majority of neurons in all three regions showed a decrease in
selectivity during above-capacity trials in comparison with below-
capacity trials (32 of 38 in LPFC, 11 of 13 in FEF, and all 4 in
LIP). This difference was signiﬁcantly above chance across all
three areas (P = 4.0 × 10−8) as well as for LPFC (P = 1.2 × 10−5),
FEF (P = 0.011), and trending for LIP (P = 0.0625, limited by
small sample size surviving the multiple selection).

Selectivity on Correct and Error Trials. As noted in the main text, we
observed a signiﬁcant reduction in object information in all three
areas (for our time periods of interest) when a second object was
added to the visual display. To perform this analysis only in-
formation about the correctly identiﬁed target was used. Un-
fortunately, this restriction, coupled with the decaying behavior
with three items in a hemiﬁeld, did not allow for analysis of three-
item displays in the correct-only analyses.

In addition to LPFC neurons, FEF neurons also carried sig-
niﬁcant object information during error trials with two items in
the display (average of 0.83% explained variance, bias corrected;
P = 0.024, permutation test). Although information in error
trials trended toward less than during correct trials (which had
a 1.2% explained variance, bias corrected) the difference did not
reach signiﬁcance (P = 0.31). In contrast, as noted in the main
text, LPFC neurons carried signiﬁcantly less information during
error trials than during correct trials (P = 0.008). Although this
difference may be due to differences in sample size (130 neurons
for LPFC, 67 for FEF) it may also reﬂect a stronger correlation
between LPFC neurons and behavior in comparison with FEF,
suggesting LPFC plays a larger role in directing behavior during
a working memory task. LIP neurons did not carry any signiﬁcant
information about stimuli during two-item conditions (Fig. 4A).
As noted in the main text we observed a signiﬁcant amount of
object information in selective LPFC neurons during error trials
alone (for both the sample, Fig. 4B, and delay, main text). We
also tested this across the entire population of LPFC neurons by
determining whether there were a signiﬁcant number of neurons
carrying signiﬁcant object information using error trials alone.
As for the correct–error comparison, we limited our analysis to
the two-item condition (where there were sufﬁcient error trials).
The information criterion was the same used for all trials (i.e.,
selectivity in two independent 100-ms windows, see above). As
before, we found a signiﬁcant number of LPFC neurons con-
veying object information during the sample period (P = 0.0056)
with a trend continuing into the delay period (P = 0.0534). This
result conﬁrms our original ﬁnding of object identity informa-
tion, even when that object is “forgotten”.
