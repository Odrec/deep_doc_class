Antonymy 

  Oppositeness 
  Gradable antonymy  

o  hot – cold 
o  uncommitted or neutral antonyms such as good – bad  

  without implication 

o  equipollent such as hot – cold

o  buy – sell 

  Reversive antonymy  

o  changes in opposite direction

List lexical items without antonyms e.g. library. 
List gradable and non-gradable antonymy pairs. 

 
 
  Gradable or not? hero – coward, giant – shrimp, genius – dolt  

 
Meronymy 

 
 

“part of” relation 
relation of part to whole

  A fruit is a part of a plant. 
  A seed is a part of a plant 
 
seed – fruit – plant

  portion-mass e.g. slice – pie 
 
stuff-object e.g. steel – car 
 
feature-activity e.g. paying – shopping 
  place-area e.g. Everglades – Florida  

 

test for transitivity 

  Holonym 

o  conversely to meronymy 
o  arm is the holonym to hand 
o  knife is the holonym to blade

List ten examples for meronymy and determine whether it’s transitive or not.

Hyponomy 

“kind of” relation, undercategories 

 
  Transitive hyponomy 

o  blues - jazz – music 
o  martini – cocktail – drink 

 

o  A koala is a kind of bear. 
o  A watch is a kind of clock. 

  Test the class inclusion for identify hyponoms: 

o  Every car is a vehicle, but not every vehicle is a car. 
o  Car is the hyponym of vehicle. 

 

List five examples for transitive hyponyms  
and write down three sentences in the “ A __ is a kind of __” structure. 

Taxonomy 

  basic to the classification and naming of biological species 
 
  Five-level taxonomy 

“kind of” relation in a strict hierarchy 

o  Unique beginner  plant 
o  Life-form 
tree 
oak 
o  Generic 
white oak 
o  Specific 
o  Varietal 
swamp white oak 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

Level 0 
Level 1 
Level 2 
Level 3 
Level 4 

  Use the five-level system for the level 0 “animal”. 

 
Synonymy 

  we are looking at lexical synonymy (between individual lexemes) 
  meaning identity  

o 

It’s likely that he’ll be late. <-> He is likely to be late. 

 

synonyms by sense; the more sense they share, the more synonymous they are 

o  pupil - student  

  Consider the pairs prize – award, couch – sofa. Are they synonyms? If so, what kind? 

Componential analysis 

 
 

reveals aspects of meaning and semantic relations 
series of hyponyms: piece of furniture – chair – armchair 

o  each level adds a semantic component e.g. for one person, with arms 
o  shown in a table with the hyponyms on the vertical part and the components on the 

horizontal part, + and – give information if the component is relevant for the hyponym 

  Write down a componential analysis table for a hyponym of your choice. 

Polysemy, monosemy and homonymy 

  polysemy = words with several related senses 

o  newspaper 

  a company that publishes written news 
  a single physical item published by the company 

  monosemy = word has a single meaning 

o  orrery (clockwork model of the solar system) 

  homonymy = two unrelated words share the same phonological form 

o  wave and waive  

  no absolute criteria to identify or distinguish polysemy and monosemy 
  Write down 3 words of each category.
