Decision Making (Naturalistic),
Psychology of

Naturalistic decision-making (NDM) is the process by
which people use their experience to make decisions in
complex real-world environments. Many of these
environments involve high levels of risk and time
pressure, are dynamically changing, and have signiﬁ-
cant consequences for both the decision maker and
others. They include domains such as ﬁreﬁghting,
aviation, medicine, and nuclear power operations.
Knowledge gained from experience on the part of the
decision maker plays a key role in the decision process,
because that knowledge is the basis for recognizing
in
situations that require decisions to be made,
determining what
to the
decision, and in deciding what would be an appro-
priate course of action.

Naturalistic decision-making is a new ﬁeld. The ﬁrst
studies were conducted in 1985 by Klein (1998), who
examined decision-making by urban ﬁreﬁghters. This
work was part of a new program initiated by the Army
Research Institute because of the Army’s dissatis-
faction with decision aids that had been developed on
the basis of traditional decision theories. The domi-
nant decision theories at that point grew out of
economic models and emphasized rational choice to
select the optimal decision option. Decision aids based
on these models were laborious, requiring military
