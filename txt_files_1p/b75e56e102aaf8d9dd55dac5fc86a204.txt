The FMSO-KU Global Security Studies Internship is a cooperative 
project of FMSO and the KU CGIS. This internship has been designed to 
provide an opportunity for graduate students to learn more about global 
security  and  military  operational  environment  analysis  and  discover 
how open source foreign language materials are used in developing 
solid research products. This analysis does not necessarily reflect the 
views of the FMSO.

Open Source, Foreign Perspective, Underconsidered/Understudied Topics
