Summary

OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that as a minority with lower socio-economic status, Turkish residents in
Germany might experience a higher mortality than Germans.
METHODS All-cause mortality rates by age group and sex of Turkish and German adults for the time period
1980–94 were calculated from death registry data and mid-year population estimates.
RESULTS The age-adjusted mortality rate (per 100000) of Turkish males aged 25–65 years resident in
Germany was 299 in 1980 and 247 in 1990, consistently half that of German males. The mortality of Turkish
females in Germany was 140 in 1990, half that of German females. Mortality of Turkish males/females in
Ankara was 835 and 426 in 1990.
CONCLUSION In view of the socio-economic status of Turkish residents in Germany the large mortality
difference compared to Germans is unexpected. It cannot be fully explained by a selection at the time of
hiring (healthy migrant effect) because it lasts over decades and extends into the second generation. A
healthy worker effect is unlikely because Turkish residents have a lower employment rate than Germans.
There is little evidence for movement of gravely ill persons back to Turkey. An ‘unhealthy re-migration effect’
in which socially successful migrants with a lower mortality risk stay in the host country while less successful
ones return home even before becoming manifestly ill would partly explain our ﬁndings.

Introduction

Migration within Europe is an on-going social phenomenon
of large scale. It affects the health of individual migrants as
well as that of populations (Bollini & Siem 1995; Elkeles &
Seifert 1996). Since the 1950s, millions of people have
temporarily migrated to Germany looking for work. About
900 000 people came from Turkey between 1963 and 1973.
Many of these Gastarbeiter (guestworkers) settled and
brought their families. They were joined by asylum seekers
from Turkey. Turkish nationals now form the largest foreign

nationality group in Germany. Their number increased from
1.5 to 2 million between 1980 and 1994 (Statistisches
Bundesamt 1996), with a brief decrease in 1985 after ﬁnancial
incentives for re-migration were offered by the German
Government.

People who migrate, whether their move is temporary or

permanent, are on average healthier than the population they
originate from, and often also healthier than the population
of their host country (Swerdlow 1991; Williams 1993; Parkin
1993). This ‘healthy migrant effect’ is due to a self-selection
process: the chronically ill and disabled are less likely to
migrate. Among migrants there are also particularly
courageous, innovative and socially skilled individuals
(Schiffauer 1991).
