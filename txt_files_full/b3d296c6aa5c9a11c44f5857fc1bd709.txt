Rapid fragmentation of neuronal networks at the onset of propofol-induced unconsciousness

Introduction   Methods   Results   Discussion   Vivid Debate

Patients anesthesized with Propofol  

Enhancement of inhibitory input of GABAergic neurons

How does this affect single neurons and larger-scale neural 
circuits?

Hypothesis: anesthetics disrupt cortical integration 

Understand spatial and temporal organization during 
induction of unconciousness

Introduction   Methods   Results   Discussion   Vivid Debate

Anesthetic drugs cause a reversible coma within seconds

Transition into unconciousness

Simultaneously record ensembles of neurons

3 Patients: Epilepsie, intractable to medication, clinical monitoring

Implanted electrodes in temporal, frontal and parietal corticies
Patient A: middle TG, 2000 Hz, 130 mg, 50 mg, 20mg
Patient B: superior TG, 250 Hz, 1x200 mg
Patient C: middle TG, 250 Hz, 1x150 mg

Single Unit Recordings

→ Spiking Rate

ECoG 

→ Areal Neuronal Activity

LFP 

→ Small Populations of Neurons

LFP = Local field potentials
ECoG = intracranial electrocorticograms
LOC = Loss of Conciousness

no response

The loss of conciousness:
Auditory task: signal ➔ button press
1 sec before first missed button press
Until second missed button press (5 sec total)

Pre-LOC differed from Post-LOC?

Introduction   Methods   Results   Discussion   Vivid Debate

How does brain activity change with LOC Loss Of Consciousness
→ with respect to Spike Rates

Spike Rate drops clearly 
after LOC

After a few minutes strong 
variability in Spike Rates

(cid:15482) no obvious association between unconsciousness and spike rate

How does brain activity change with LOC Loss Of Consciousness
→ with respect to the temporal structure of spiking

Strong variability

Low variability

(cid:15482) constant increase in slow oscillation band

Introduction   Methods   Results   Discussion   Vivid Debate

How are spike rates related to the slow oscillation?

Spike activity only around minima of the slow oscillation (<1Hz)

(cid:15482) Spike rates are phase-coupled to slow oscillation

Introduction   Methods   Results   Discussion   Vivid Debate

Slow oscillation over spatial distances

Most important

Different phases of slow oscillation 
in distant and nearby brain regions

Grey: local ON-Phases with Spike Activity

While the local region is active, distant regions are likely to be inactive
(cid:15482) Suppressed communication between distant regions!

Introduction   Methods   Results   Discussion   Vivid Debate

How does brain activity change with LOC Loss Of Consciousness
→ with respect to the regional information processing

Question: Is the activity in ON Phases structured or random?

… sophisticated statistics … 

Spike activity can be predicted using the spike history, similar to the PreLOC state

(cid:15482) “Normal“ information processing during ON periods

Hypothesis:

Slow Oscillations and periodic spiking 
  

→ Fragmantation of Neuronal Networks 
  

→ LOC/Unconsciousness

sleep and coma

Patients were epileptic → Problem?

General problem: how to test LOC?

Appendix

How does brain activity change with LOC Loss Of Consciousness
→ with respect to the regional information processing

The regional activity can be 
explained using >30ms of history, 
indicating a structure within the 
local network

Activity of local networks is not only 
disordered spiking. The structure is 
preserved during the ON periods

How are spike rates related to the slow oscillation?

Appendix

ON periods of the spike activity begin 
at the minimum of the slow oscillation

Gamma power (25 - 50 Hz) is also associated with 

local ON periods
