A critical period for auditory thalamocortical connectivity
Tania Rinaldi Barkat1, Daniel B Polley2 & Takao K Hensch1

Neural circuits are shaped by experience during periods of heightened brain plasticity in early postnatal life. Exposure to acoustic 
features produces age-dependent changes through largely unresolved cellular mechanisms and sites of origin. We isolated the 
refinement of auditory thalamocortical connectivity by in vivo recordings and day-by-day voltage-sensitive dye imaging in an acute 
brain slice preparation. Passive tone-rearing modified response strength and topography in mouse primary auditory cortex (A1) 
during a brief, 3-d window, but did not alter tonotopic maps in the thalamus. Gene-targeted deletion of a forebrain-specific cell-
adhesion molecule (Icam5) accelerated plasticity in this critical period. Consistent with its normal role of slowing spinogenesis, 
loss of Icam5 induced precocious stubby spine maturation on pyramidal cell dendrites in neocortical layer 4 (L4), identifying a 
primary locus of change for the tonotopic plasticity. The evolving postnatal connectivity between thalamus and cortex in the days 
following hearing onset may therefore determine a critical period for auditory processing.

Neural circuits are shaped by experience during periods of heightened 
brain plasticity in early life1,2. Children raised in an English-speaking envi-
ronment easily distinguish between the phonemes /la/ and /ra/, whereas 
those growing up in Japan find it increasingly difficult3. Passive exposure 
of young rodents to a variety of sound features reveals a cascading series 
of developmental windows that open and close shortly after hearing onset 
to define the persistent and specific influences of early experience on the 
functional organization of auditory cortex4–6. The underlying sites of 
plasticity along the auditory pathway, as well as potential mechanisms 
engaged during such critical periods, remain unknown.

Motivated  by  the  well  known  binocular  interactions  shaped  by 
experience in developing visual cortex7–9, we used in vivo neurophysi-
ological recordings to determine whether mouse A1 also exhibits a 
critical period for tonotopic map plasticity induced through passive 
tone exposure, and whether such plasticity is present in the auditory 
thalamus (ventral medial geniculate body, MGBv). We then isolated 
the  connection  between  MGBv  and  primary  auditory  cortex  (A1)  
(ref. 10) in an acute brain slice preparation11 and used voltage-sensitive 
dye imaging (VSDI) techniques in vitro. We mapped A1 responses to 
electrical stimulation of discrete sites in MGBv across early postnatal 
days (P8–20), following tone-rearing or gene manipulation. Our results 
reveal a critical period for acoustically driven topographic plasticity at 
thalamocortical connections in mouse A1.

RESULTS
Tone exposure modifies tonotopic maps in A1, but not MGBv
The auditory system is tonotopically organized10 such that tones of 
similar frequency activate neighboring neurons at each station along 
the pathway. Given that rats show experience-dependent tonotopic map 
reorganization following passive tone exposure during the second post-
natal week2,12, we first used high-density in vivo mapping to delineate 
A1 tonotopy in young adult mice13 that were reared either in typical 
acoustic environments (Fig. 1a) or in the presence of pulsed 7-kHz tone 

pips from P11 to P15 (Fig. 1b) or P16 to P20 (Fig. 1c). Comparison of 
representative tonal receptive fields drawn from caudal, intermediate 
and rostral map locations (Fig. 1d) revealed that tone-rearing from P11 
to P15, but not P16 to P20, was sufficient to shift A1 best frequencies 
toward the 7-kHz exposure frequency (P11–15 versus exposure, n = 5  
mice and 93 sites for each group, P = 0.003; P16–20, 4 mice and 64 sites 
versus no exposure, P = 1.0, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; Fig. 1e). On 
closer inspection, the expansion of best frequency representations near 
the exposure frequency was attributable to topographically specific real-
location of best frequencies in caudal and intermediate regions of the 
tonotopic map proximal to where 7 kHz is normally represented, rather 
than a shift in more rostral map areas that retain normal tuning to higher 
frequencies (P = 0.009, 0.04 and 0.14 for P11–15 versus no exposure at 
caudal, mid and rostral locations, respectively, t test; Fig. 1f,g).

To determine whether remapping in A1 could be explained by a 
shifted frequency representation in the principal subcortical input 
source, we also examined best frequency distributions in the MGBv. 
We inserted a multichannel silicon probe at an angle that matched 
the plane of section used in subsequent thalamocortical slice experi-
ments13 (Fig. 2a). This approach allowed us to sample the low-to-
high,  lateral-to-medial  best  frequency  gradient  in  MGBv  in  vivo 
(Fig. 2b) with a comparable multi-unit signal-to-noise ratio as in 
our A1 recordings (Fig. 2c) while excluding recordings from audi-
tory areas medial to MGBv (Fig. 2d and Online Methods). Although 
7-kHz rearing from P11–15 induced a significant shift in A1 maps 
(Fig. 1), we found no evidence for shifts in overall best frequency 
distributions in MGBv (P11–15, n = 5 mice and 151 sites versus no 
exposure, n = 4 mice and 101 sites; P = 0.99, Kolmogorov-Smirnov 
test; Fig. 2e) or differences in mean best frequency at lateral (50 (cid:77)m  
into MGBv), more medial (200 (cid:77)m into MGBv) or across all recording  
sites (P = 0.44, 0.18 and 0.91 at lateral, medial and overall locations, 
respectively, t test; Fig. 2f). In contrast, other auditory receptive  
field changes, such as best frequency–specific reductions in tuning

preserving the thalamocortical connection to A1 (Fig. 3a)11, and used 
VSDI to measure cortical response (Supplementary Fig. 2). Discrete 
current pulses to MGBv yielded topographically distinct, maximal 
responses across upper L4 of A1 that we used to derive a map of peak 
amplitudes as function of stimulus site (L4 loci; Fig. 3a)13.

In young animals (P8–12), responses to lateral MGBv loci were 
significantly weaker than responses to medial stimuli (peak (cid:36)F/F at 
locus 1, 0.30 (cid:111) 0.06; locus 6, 0.82 (cid:111) 0.05; n = 13 each, P < 0.00001,

gradually disappeared with brain maturation. After P15, peak cortical

responses were similar across stimulus sites (Fig. 3b). Notably, the 
adjustment of thalamocortical response strength occurred in 3 d, 
between P12 and P15, coinciding with the emergence of adult-like 
A1 neural response thresholds for airborne sound transmission6,16. 
We validated these thalamocortical modifications over development 
at synaptic resolution by direct patch-clamp recording from upper L4 
pyramidal neurons in mice before P12 and comparing the results with 
those from mice after P15 (Supplementary Fig. 3).

Notably, the mapping of peak response in L4 as a function of MGBv 
stimulus site did not change during the developmental period that we 
studied (P8–20). As indicated by the linear relation of peak (cid:36)F/F position 
in L4 to MGBv input (topographic slope; Fig. 3c), an orderly spatial layout 
of this pathway was already present before hearing onset16, even as con-
nection strengths were still maturing across the map (Fig. 3b).

A critical period for thalamocortical connectivity
Normal acoustic experience therefore did not modify the intrinsic 
organization of thalamocortical input present at hearing onset. In 
contrast, if the mice were exposed early to an abnormal acoustic  
environment,  the  topography  was  markedly  altered.  Maximal  A1 
responses along the rostro-caudal L4 axis in P16–20 mice were con-
centrated near a single, middle MGBv input after continuous exposure 
to 7-kHz tone pips from P8 (Fig. 4a,b). Although the strength of

MGBv stimulus site

cortical  responses  retained  homogeneity  across  stimulus  sites,  a 
clear flattening of topographic slope was evident in L4 (Fig. 4c). This 
direct  functional  rearrangement  of  thalamocortical  response  was 
confirmed by comparing the distributions of input strength for two 
independent stimulus sites (1 and 6) (control, P = 0.003; exposed,  
P  =  0.181;  ANOVA),  as  well  as  the  gradient  of  peak  locations  
(P = 0.029, ANOVA), in control and exposed mice.

We exposed mice to 7-kHz tones for shorter, 3-d intervals (P8–11, 
P12–15 and P16–19; Fig. 4d) and found significant topographic reor-
ganization only when mice were exposed from P12–15 (topographic 
slope at P20, no exposure = 1.42 (cid:111) 0.37, n = 9; versus P12–15, expo-
sure = 0.07 (cid:111) 0.13, n = 8; P = 0.026, Mann-Whitney U test; Fig. 4e). 
This identified a critical period for mouse auditory thalamocortical 
topography that coincides with the normal time window during which 
this connection is maturing (Fig. 3b) and for tonotopic map changes 
in vivo (Fig. 1). Topographic remapping was not restricted to 7 kHz, 
as passive tone exposure to 20 kHz (from P12–15) produced a similar 
topographic reorganization at a correspondingly more rostral A1 
locus (Supplementary Fig. 4).

Laminar shift of connectivity during the critical period
We further examined the emergence of A1 responses along a cortical 
column during postnatal development. As expected, the maximum 
response amplitude to MGBv stimulation was located in upper L4 at 325 (cid:111)  
75 (cid:77)m from the pial surface for all of the ages that we studied (Fig. 5a). 
Although each thalamocortical preparation was unique, the variability 
in geometry and size of various anatomical hallmarks relative to a refer-
ence point (the rostral tip of the hippocampus; Supplementary Fig. 5) 
was small across the developmental period studied (Supplementary 
Fig. 5). Notably, changes in total cortical thickness across these ages 
were negligible (<10 (cid:77)m per bin) with respect to the individual bin 
sizes.  However,  the  location  of  shortest  response  latency  shifted

P16–20 = 325 (cid:111) 75 (cid:77)m, P < 0.0001, t test; Fig. 5a). This was true across 
the entire rostro-caudal extent of A1 (Supplementary Fig. 6).

Moreover, when polysynaptic activity was weakened in a modified 
(high divalent cation, X2+) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF)11, the  
strong signal observed in upper L4 was significantly reduced at P8–12,  
but not in older animals ((cid:36)F/Fnormal – (cid:36)F/Fhigh x(cid:18)(cid:11))/((cid:36)F/Fnormal):

P = 0.020; versus P16–20, 0.01 (cid:111) 0.05, n = 4, P = 0.038, Mann-Whitney 
U test; Fig. 5b). Tone exposure did not affect this upward translocation 
of direct thalamocortical input to L4, as there was little reduction of 
peak signal in high divalent cation ACSF for mice that were passively 
exposed to 7 kHz (P16–20 = 0.11 (cid:111) 0.19, n = 4). These results indicate 
that thalamic inputs initially target their synapses to deeper regions, 
most probably the subplate (a transient zone in the developing neo-
cortex)17–19, before invading L4 during the critical period.

Forebrain-selective gene deletion accelerates plasticity
To establish a thalamocortical mechanism for this critical period 
plasticity, we analyzed a mouse model carrying a forebrain-specific 
gene deletion of Icam5, which is an intercellular adhesion molecule 
that is expressed exclusively in the telencephalon20 and is sorted into 
dendrites of pyramidal cells to slow spine maturation21 (Fig. 6a). 
Notably, Icam5 was not expressed in the MGBv or other subcortical 
structures in wild-type animals, and was absent throughout the brain 
of Icam5−/− mice (Fig. 6b).

Consistent with Icam5 being a negative regulator of spine mat-
uration, peak A1 response strength in upper L4 of Icam5−/− mice 
matured rapidly to a homogeneous distribution in just 1 d, from P12 
to P13 (Fig. 6c), unlike the typical 3 d that is needed in wild-type  
mice  (Fig.  3b).  By  P13,  Icam5−/−  mice  already  exhibited  a  fully

mature amplitude distribution that was comparable to that of P16 
wild-type mice (Supplementary Fig. 7a). Moreover, the upward shift 
of columnar response latencies occurred faster in Icam5−/− mice and 
was also mature by P13 (Supplementary Fig. 7b). These animals 
exhibit stronger long-term potentiation and hippocampal learning 
behavior20, suggesting that a similar mechanism may be at work for 
thalamocortical synapses in L4.

As the period of normal circuit maturation corresponds to the criti-
cal period for topographic changes in wild-type mice (Figs. 3b and 4e), 
we tested whether plasticity would also be accelerated in Icam5−/− mice. 
The topography of Icam5−/− mice was identical to that of wild-type 
mice when they were raised in normal acoustic environments (Fig. 6d).  
However, exposing the mice to 7-kHz tones for just 1 d (P12–13)  
significantly altered topography at P16–20 in Icam5−/− mice, but not 
in wild-type mice (topographic slope: wild type, 0.86 (cid:111) 0.20, n = 9; 
Icam5−/−, 0.23 (cid:111) 0.10, n = 7; P = 0.014, Mann-Whitney U test; Fig. 6d). 
Even 2 d of exposure were insufficient to yield topographic changes in 
wild-type mice (P12–14 or P13–15; Supplementary Fig. 7c).

Exposing Icam5−/− mice between P13–14 also altered topography, 
but to a lesser extent than at P12–13 (topographic slope: Icam5−/− 
not exposed, 0.97 (cid:111) 0.03, n = 9; Icam5−/− exposed between P13–14, 
0.25 (cid:111) 0.22, n = 9; P = 0.048, Mann-Whitney U test; Fig. 6d). Even 
later exposure between P14–15 (Fig. 6d) or before the typical critical 
period (P8–11, Supplementary Fig. 7c) did not cause any significant 
change in the topographic organization of Icam5−/− mice (P = 0.70  
or 0.22 between non-exposed and P14–15 or P8–11 exposed, respec-
tively; Mann-Whitney U test). Thus, the critical period itself is not 
shifted earlier in time, but is instead shortened in duration in the absence 
of forebrain-specific Icam5. These findings underscore indications from

wild-type mice that the tonotopic critical period directly reflects a tran-
sition in the maturational state of thalamocortical connections22.

Stubby spine density increases through the critical period
Given that Icam5 slows filopodia-to-spine transitions21, we examined 
whether enhanced spinogenesis might contribute to the accelerated 
critical period plasticity in Icam5−/− mice. Dendritic spines in L4 in 
a 100-(cid:77)m radius around cortical pyramidal cell somata have been 
reported to receive direct thalamocortical input (Fig. 7a)23. Spines in 
this region were significantly more dense at P13 in Icam5−/− mice than 
in wild-type mice (spine density: wild type, 0.32 (cid:111) 0.02 (cid:77)m−1, n = 6 
neurons and 1,777 spines; Icam5−/−, 0.42 (cid:111) 0.02 (cid:77)m−1, n = 7 neurons 
and 2,567 spines; P = 0.0012, Mann-Whitney U test; Fig. 7b).

Notably, this increase was significant only for stubby spines (wild-
type density, 0.24 (cid:111) 0.02 (cid:77)m−1, n = 1,277 spines; Icam5−/− density, 0.33 (cid:111)  
0.02 (cid:77)m−1, n = 1,992 spines; P = 0.001, Mann-Whitney U test), which are 
preferentially targeted by MGBv thalamic afferents23. Similarly in wild-type 
mice, a later increase in stubby spine density was eventually observed by 
P16, marking the end of their typical critical period for tonotopic plasticity 
(0.44 (cid:111) 0.03 (cid:77)m−1, n = 7 neurons and 2,534 spines; Fig. 7c). Thus, dendritic 
spine maturation on thalamo-recipient cortical neurons is a likely locus 
defining the temporal window for topographic map plasticity in A1.

DISCUSSION
We identified with ever-finer resolution a developmental plastic-
ity occurring at thalamocortical connections related to tonotopy in 
A1. Accelerated refinement in the absence of the forebrain-specific 
molecule Icam5 and the stability of MGBv in vivo on tone exposure 
both support the view that this critical period reflects dendritic spine 
maturation on L4 neurons in A1.

Previously, tonotopy has primarily been assessed by micro-electrode 
recording of spiking activity in response to a given tone5,12. The result-
ant best frequency maps exhibited relatively precise point-to-point  
correlation  between  tone  frequency  and  its  preferred  site  in  the  
cortical map (Figs. 1 and 2). In contrast, VSDI in a slice preparation 
revealed that stimulation of a point in MGBv recruits peak activity 

A R T I C L E S

from a broad swath of the A1 map that reflects primarily subthreshold, 
monosynaptic activation rather than polysynaptic intra-cortical exci-
tation (Fig. 5b). The same discrepancy is observed in rodent barrel 
cortex, where in vivo microelectrode recordings have suggested that 
there is a highly focused mapping between a single whisker and its 
corresponding barrel24, whereas in vivo VSDI or intrinsic signal imag-
ing have shown that stimulation of a single whisker can evoke sub-
stantial activity across a much broader area of the barrel cortex25–27.
Both  somatosensory  imaging  studies  and  our  own  data  in  A1 
(ref. 13) confirm that the spatial peak of the subthreshold activity 
profile closely corresponds to the map of preferred stimuli obtained 
with microelectrode mapping. This supports our use of VSDI peak 
and its topographic slope to track developmental and experiential 
changes in thalamocortical function and to relate these changes to 
observations made through conventional mapping of best frequencies  
(Figs. 1 and 2). At the single-cell level, direct whole-cell recordings 
of synaptic strength across ages further corroborated the use of VSDI 
peak measurements (Supplementary Fig. 3). Our imaging approach 
therefore provides the appropriate spatial resolution for bridging the 
gap between in vivo network and in vitro cellular observations of 
plasticity mechanism in the developing auditory system.

With its submillisecond time resolution, VSDI further revealed 
the sequence of activation in a given zone; for example, across the 
topographic extent of A1 (ref. 13) or along a cortical column. This 
technique  can  therefore  resolve  fast  monosynaptic  connections 
from  the  thalamus  and  slower,  polysynaptic  intracortical  inputs. 
During maturation17,19, deeper regions consisting of the subplate, a 
 transient neocortical structure present in several cortical areas early 
in development, are largely replaced by the cortical plate, in particular 
L6. Subplate neurons send strong excitatory projections up to L4, 
which may regulate activity-dependent processes that catalyze the 
 maturation and plasticity of the developing cortex19.

At the cellular level, the mechanism of plasticity is related to stubby 
spine maturation proximal to the soma. These spines have been iden-
tified as the direct targets of thalamocortical axons23 and may under-
lie the change in thalamocortical connection strength. The critical 
period profile can be manipulated by acting on this process directly. 
Our results support the idea that there is accelerated morphologi-
cal and functional plasticity in the absence of Icam5. Our results are 
consistent with the spine pruning and regrowth that are characteristic 
of other critical periods, such as in the visual cortex28. Conversely, in 
the latter system, GABA circuits have been implicated in the onset, 
and various structural brakes, such as peri-neuronal nets or myelin-
related signaling, in the closure of plasticity29. It will be interesting to 
determine the extent to which these mechanisms apply in A1.

Consistent  with  observations  made  for  brainstem  tonotopy30, 
thalamocortical topography was already organized at hearing onset 
(Fig. 3). Thus, topographic organization is established before sensory 
experience. By VSDI of subthreshold input, topography in vitro is well 
correlated with tonotopy in vivo13. As we found, both were modified 
during a brief critical period from P12–15 in mice exposed to abnor-
mal acoustic environments. In rats, such plasticity is known to impair 
the perception of the over-represented frequency while improving the 
discrimination of immediately adjacent frequencies31.

The critical period for topographic plasticity defined here can be pre-
dicted by examining the day-by-day development of connectivity in nor-
mally reared animals. During this maturation process, the direct cortical 
targets of thalamic input shift from deeper regions to L4 (Fig. 5), where 
the number of stubby spines nearest the soma increased significantly  
(P = 0.0004, Mann-Whitney U test). The temporal overlap of these changes 
in L4 may largely contribute to the in vivo tonotopic map reorganization

following passive tone exposure (Fig. 1), given the lack of tonotopic map 
changes in the MGBv (Fig. 2). However, this does not preclude additional 
changes at other intracortical sites during the critical period, such as poten-
tial refinement of local excitatory-inhibitory balance32,33. Detailed analysis 
of the developing cortical microcircuit, as has already been presented for 
the mature auditory cortex34, will be informative.

Isolating a developmental plasticity at the thalamocortical connec-
tion does not preclude potential changes in other subcortical regions 
reflecting auditory experience. Indeed, auditory plasticity has been 
reported in the midbrain and brainstem circuits, but has typically 
been associated with sensorineural hearing loss30,35 or prolonged 
stimulus manipulations36–39. It has yet to be determined whether 
subcortical reorganization occurs there de novo or is brought about 
by changes first arising in A1 that are then reflected in midbrain or 
brainstem nuclei via corticofugal inputs40,41. The auditory cortex itself 
is known to exhibit sequential critical periods beyond tonotopy6,42,43. 
For example, following the closure of a critical period for tonotopic 
map reorganization, we continued to observe rearing-induced changes 
in tuning bandwidth. Notably, the latter changes were observed not 
only in A1, but also in the MGBv (Supplementary Fig. 1). Thus, it will 
be important to understand how subsequent stages of plasticity are 
related to the initial refinement of thalamocortical connections.

In vivo electrophysiology. All experimental procedures were carried out accord-
ing to Harvard and Vanderbilt University animal care and use guidelines. A1 and 
MGBv recordings were made from the left hemisphere at P28–40. Mice were 
brought to a surgical plane of anesthesia using a combination of pentobarbital 
sodium (50 mg per kg of body weight followed by 10–15 mg per kg supplements as 
needed) and chlorprothixene (0.2 mg). Multi-unit responses were recorded from 
the middle cortical layers of A1 (420–440 (cid:77)m from pial surface) with epoxylite-
coated tungsten microelectrodes (2.0 M(cid:55) at 1 kHz, FHC) and from MGBv with 
16-channel silicon probes (177-(cid:77)m2 contact area, 50-(cid:77)m inter-contact separa-
tion, Neuronexus Technologies). Frequency response areas were measured with 
pseudo-randomly presented tone pips of variable frequency (5.5 to 45.3 kHz in 
0.1-octave increments, 20-ms duration, 5 ms raised cosine onset/offset ramps, 
0.6-s intertrial interval, one presentation per unique tone/level combination) and 
level (0–60 dB SPL in 5-dB increments) delivered from a free field electrostatic 
speaker placed 12 cm from the contralateral ear.

Best frequency was defined for each recording site as the tone frequency that 
evoked the greatest number of spikes. A1 was readily identified by a clear caudal-
to-rostral low-to-high best frequency gradient and was bounded by sharp best 
frequency reversals or unresponsive sites as described previously13,44. A topo-
graphic analysis of best frequencies was achieved by dividing the map into equal 
thirds along the caudal-to-rostral extent and separately analyzing best frequen-
cies in each sector (Figs. 1f,g and 2f). No significant differences were found in 
the spatial sampling density in each sector of the map, justifying comparisons of 
overall best frequency distributions between groups (P = 0.56 for P11–15 versus 
no exposure and P = 0.29 for P16–20 versus no exposure, (cid:67)2 test).

For MGBv, a multi-channel silicon probe was inserted under stereotaxic  
guidance at the same dorsoventral angle used for the brain slice preparation to 
effectively isolate it from other thalamic subdivisions. This was confirmed by 
carefully noting a reversal in the best frequency gradient marking the medial 
edge of MGBv and by post mortem reconstruction of electrode tracks and lesion 
sites according to previously described methods13.

Acute auditory thalamocortical slice preparation. C57BL/6J (Jackson Labs) or 
Icam5−/− mice (P8–20, courtesy of M. Mishina, University of Tokyo) were rapidly 
decapitated without anesthesia and placed in ice-cold ACSF. Slices were sectioned 
on a vibratome (Microm HM 650V, Thermo Scientific) according to a previously 
described method11. Briefly, 600-(cid:77)m-thick horizontal slices with the lateral end 
raised 15°, were cut in ice-cold ACSF and incubated at 35 °C for at least 15 min, 
before returning to 20–22 °C. One left hemisphere slice was used per animal. The 
ACSF contained 125 mM NaCl, 25 mM glucose, 25 mM NaHCO3, 2.5 mM KCl, 
2 mM CaCl2, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4 and 1 mM MgCl2 (315–328 mOsm).
VSDI. The voltage-sensitive dye Di-4-ANEPPS (Invitrogen catalog #D-1199), 
 dissolved at 0.01 mg ml−1 in dimethylsulfoxide stock solution, was diluted 
(0.6 (cid:77)l ml−1) in ACSF to a final solution of 5 (cid:77)g l−1 Di-4-ANEPPS. Slices 
were incubated for at least 90 min before transfer to an ACSF (20–22 °C) 
recording chamber. Slices were imaged using an Olympus MVX10 microscope 
with 1× 0.25 numerical aperture objective. Excitation light from a shuttered 
150-W  halogen  lamp  (MHF-G150LR,  Moritex)  was  band-pass  filtered  
(515 and 535 nm) and reflected toward the sample by a 570-nm dichroic 
 mirror. Emitted fluorescence, reflecting a change in potential across neuronal 
membranes45,46 (Supplementary Fig. 3), was long-pass filtered (590 nm) and 
imaged using a MiCam Ultima CMOS-based camera (SciMedia). Fluorescent 
changes (1-ms frame rate for 512-ms periods) were averaged across ten trials 
and integrated across different regions of interest containing 5 × 5 pixels 
 covering 125 × 125 (cid:77)m by spatial averaging and across different trials using 
MiCam Ultima analysis software.

Individual  time  course  traces  were  subsequently  exported  to  Igor  Pro 
(WaveMetrics) to combine data for a number of slices. Fluorescence change 
was normalized to resting fluorescence ((cid:36)F/F0). Stimulation was controlled by a 
programmable pulse generator (MiCam Ultima software, SciMedia) linked to a 
constant current stimulus isolation unit (Iso-Flex, A.M.P.I.). Discrete sites in the 
MGBv were activated with an ACSF-filled patch pipette (0.5 mA, 1-ms pulse) at 
100 ms after recording onset.

Response amplitude was defined as maximum fluorescence change ((cid:36)F/F) 
per trial at a given region of interest. Peak amplitude was defined as maximum 

response amplitude across all L4 locations. Variations in daily preparation were 
normalized by slice; all signals were divided by the maximum change in fluores-
cence measured in a set of experiments:

(cid:29)

(cid:9)

Response latency was defined as the time elapsed from stimulus pulse to half-
maximal signal amplitude. As VSDI reports relative changes in fluorescence as 
a function of membrane potential fluctuation45, the absolute changes in fluores-
cence might reflect a number of technical, as well as biological, considerations 
(such as differential staining and transparency). Thus, our VSDI results are pre-
sented as normalized signals for comparison across ages and conditions.

The strongest signals as a function of MGBv stimulus site were taken from 
regions of interest along the rostro-caudal axis of A1 at a constant distance from an 
anatomical landmark chosen as reference (most rostral point X of hippocampus 
in Supplementary Fig. 5) and at constant depth from the pia, corresponding 
to upper L4 on the basis of Nissl stains (Fig. 5a), covering a total distance of  
2,250 (cid:77)m. The stimulating electrode was positioned on the rostral MGBv at 
six discrete positions spaced at 100-(cid:77)m intervals along the medio-lateral axis  
(landmark 4 for stimulus site 1; Supplementary Fig. 5)13.

For columnar analysis, regions of interest in which the signal in upper L4 
was strongest were chosen along the medio-lateral A1 axis orthogonal to the 
pia, for a total distance of 1,000 (cid:77)m. The stimulating electrode was placed in the 
most rostral part of the MGBv in which the stimulus could evoke the strongest 
response in A1 (landmark 5; Supplementary Fig. 5). To assess any polysynaptic 
contribution, we used a modified ACSF with high divalent cation (X2+) content11: 
115 mM NaCl, 25 mM glucose, 25 mM NaHCO3, 2.5 mM KCl, 7.2 mM CaCl2 
and 4.2 mM MgCl2 (315–325 mOsm). To confirm the synaptic nature of the 
response, we added 40 (cid:77)M #(−)-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid and 10 (cid:77)M 
6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione to the ACSF at the end of most experi-
ments (Supplementary Fig. 2b).

Sound exposure. Subsets of mouse pups and mothers were placed in a sound-
attenuating chamber (IAC) and exposed to 7- or 20-kHz tones (100-ms pulses 
at 5 Hz47,48 for 1 s, followed by 2 s of silence, 78 or 73 dB SPL, respectively).  
A 7-kHz frequency was chosen as the middle of the sound spectrogram for mouse 
pup wriggling calls49, and therefore ethological for mice of this age. Mice were 
otherwise reared under standard conditions (12:12 h light:dark cycle, access to 
water and food ab libitum) and moved about freely in their cage. Audible (7 kHz) 
tones were generated by Audacity software (http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) and 
amplified by speakers placed in two corners of the chamber. High-frequency 
(20 kHz) tones were generated by Adobe Audition software and amplified by an 
electrostatic speaker driver (ED1) and electrostatic speaker (ES1, Tucker Davis 
Technologies) placed on top of the mouse cage.

Subsets of mice were exposed to 7-kHz tones from P8 until recording (removed 
less than 30 min before decapitation) around P20 (P19–21). Other subsets were 
exposed for shorter time windows, P8 to P11, P12 to P15, P16 to P19, P12 to 
P13, P13 to P14, P14 to P15, P12 to P14 or P13 to P15, and were then returned to 
standard housing conditions until decapitation around P20 for VSDI.

DiI labeling. C57BL/6J mice at P13 or P16 (Jackson Lab) or Icam5−/− mice at 
P13 were anesthetized with nembutal (50 mg per kg) and killed by transcar-
dial perfusion with 0.9% saline (wt/vol) and 4% paraformaldehyde (wt/vol) in  
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Brains were trimmed and thalamocortical slices 
were cut (200 (cid:77)m thick) for ‘DiOlistics’ labeling with lipophilic dye (DiI, Molecular 
Probes) coated on tungsten particles (0.7-(cid:77)m diameter, Bio-Rad)50. Density of 
labeling was controlled by gas pressure (200-psi helium) and no other filters. 
Randomly labeled pyramidal neurons situated in upper L4 of A1 were selected 
by confocal microscopy (40× air objective, 3× zoom; FluoView1000, Olympus). 
Images at 0.25-(cid:77)m steps were acquired and stacked for three-dimensional recon-
struction using FluoView software. Neurites were reconstructed in a radius of 
100 (cid:77)m from the soma using Neurolucida (MicroBrightField). All protrusions 
along apical and basal dendrites were counted. Those with distinct heads and 
head diameter larger than neck diameter were classified as mushroom spines, 
whereas dendritic protrusions without distinct heads were classified as stubby 
spines23. Spines that were thinner than 0.3 (cid:77)m and longer than 2 (cid:77)m, defined as 
filopodia or thin spines, were not counted.

slices. Briefly, slices (600 and 100 (cid:77)m thick for Nissl and Icam5 staining, respec-
tively) were kept in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 20–22 °C, washed in 
PBS, solubilized, blocked in 0.8% Triton X-100 (wt/vol) and 20% bovine serum 
albumin (BSA, wt/vol) in PBS (4 °C overnight), and incubated for Nissl stain with 
NeuroTrace 435/455 (Molecular Probes) or rabbit polyclonal antibody to Icam5 
(courtesy of Y. Yoshihara, RIKEN BSI)21 in 5% BSA in PBS (4 °C overnight), 
followed by a fluorescent secondary antibody.

In vitro patch-clamp recording. Slice preparation and stimulation protocols 
were as described for the VSDI experiments. Whole-cell recordings of upper 
L4 pyramidal neurons were amplified using Axopatch 200B amplifiers (Axon 
Instruments,  Molecular  Devices).  Voltages  (in  current-clamp  mode)  were 
recorded with pipettes containing 120 mM potassium gluconate, 10 mM KCl,  
4 mM ATP-MG, 10 mM phosphocreatine, 0.3 mM GTP, 10 mM HEPES and 0.2% 
biocytin (wt/vol, pH 7.3, 290 mOsm). For each slice, up to three cells per stimulus 
site (1, 3 and 5) and L4 location (8, 10 and 13, respectively) were patched, and 
the cell with the strongest response (average of 30 traces, clamped at −70 mV) 
was used for the analysis.

Statistical analyses. Results are reported as mean (cid:111) s.e.m. and compared across 
groups using a two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t test with statistical significance 
at P < 0.05 if n was bigger than 10, where n represents the number of animals 
or neurons for Figures 1, 2 and 7, per experiment. For small data samples  

(n < 10), or where the assumption of a Gaussian distribution could not be veri-
fied, results were reported as median (cid:111) s.e.m., and the nonparametric two-tailed 
Mann-Whitney U or Wilcoxon rank sum test was used (Figs. 4e, 5b, 6 and 7 and 
Supplementary Fig. 3b) with statistical significance at P < 0.05. Input strength 
distributions (Fig. 4a) and gradient of peak locations (Fig. 4c) were compared 
with two-way ANOVA tests. Best frequency distributions (Figs. 1e and 2e) were 
compared with two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests.
