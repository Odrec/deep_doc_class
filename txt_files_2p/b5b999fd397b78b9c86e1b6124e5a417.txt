Interior Space Perception: Effects of Furniture, 

Color, and Lighting

Wednesday, 14 January 2015, 5 pm (sharp) 32/110

Abstract

 
Virtual  interior  spaces  have  become  part  of  our  everyday 
lives. We become immersed in them in the movie theater or 
when we pull out our smart-phones and delve into an app. 
However,  surprisingly  little  is  known  about  the  factors  that 
determine  the  perception  of  interior  space,  and  whether 
real  and  virtual  interior  spaces  follow  similar  laws.  We 
report  a  series  of  experiments  investigating  the  role  of 
lighting  and  furniture  on  perceived  spatial  dimensions  and 
roominess of virtual and genuine rooms. Movie stills, virtual 
rooms,  and  a  room  with  a  hoisting  platform  served  as 
stimuli.
