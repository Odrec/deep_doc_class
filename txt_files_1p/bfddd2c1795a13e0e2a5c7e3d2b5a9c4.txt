Abstract:  The  zero-sum  nature  of  mega-event  hosting  encourages  cities  to  escalate 

investment  with  an  eye  towards  convincing  event  rights  holders  that  a  positive  outcome 

will  result.  The  discursive  frameworks  of  ―legacy‖  and  ―sustainability‖,  the  global 

competition  to  attract  events  and  the  compressed  event  horizon  make  for  mega-event 

preparation regimes  that  may  seriously  compromise  long-term  urban  planning  agendas  in 

mega-event  hosts.  By  examining  the  sustainable  urban  planning  literature,  the  discursive 

frameworks  of  sustainability  in  the  International  Olympic  Committee  (IOC)  and  the 

discursive framing of the Rio 2016 bid, this paper will examine the  Olympic Golf project 

being implemented in Rio de Janeiro. Through this case study the paper argues that unless  

mega-event rights holders change their candidacy and selection processes, these events will 

inevitably be detrimental to their hosts.

1. Introduction  

―Matters of social justice, of economic development, of international relations, of democracy, 

of  democratic  control  over  technological  change  and  globalization  also  have  both  short  and  

long-term  implications.  For  a  given  policy  to  be  desirable,  it  must  meet  the  constraints  of 

sustainability  in  each  of  these  dimensions;  failure  in  any  one  is,  in  theory,  sufficient  cause  

for rejection‖ [1]. 

According to the United Nations, sustainable development, ―meets the needs of the present without 

compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs‖ [2]. The Report of the World
