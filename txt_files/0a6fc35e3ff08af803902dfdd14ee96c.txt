Cytoplasmic ATP Hydrolysis Powers
Transport of Lipopolysaccharide
Across the Periplasm in E. coli

Suguru Okuda,1 Elizaveta Freinkman,1 Daniel Kahne1,2*

Millions of molecules of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) must be assembled on the Escherichia coli
cell surface each time the cell divides. The biogenesis of LPS requires seven essential
lipopolysaccharide transport (Lpt) proteins to move LPS from the inner membrane through the
periplasm to the cell surface. However, no intermediate transport states have been observed.
We developed methods to observe intermediate LPS molecules bound to Lpt proteins in the process
of being transported in vivo. Movement of individual LPS molecules along these binding sites
required multiple rounds of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis in vitro, which suggests
that ATP is used to push a continuous stream of LPS through a transenvelope bridge in discrete
steps against a concentration gradient.

The outer membrane of Gram-negative bacte-

ria is an asymmetric bilayer, with the inner
leaflet composed of phospholipids and
the outer leaflet composed of lipopolysaccharide
(LPS). The LPS layer allows Gram-negative
bacteria to survive in harsh environments and
in the presence of many antibiotics. However,
phospholipids and LPS do not spontaneously
assemble into an asymmetric bilayer, and the
cell devotes substantial resources to synthesiz-
ing LPS at the inner membrane and assembling
it in the outer membrane (1). The process by
which hydrophobic LPS molecules are trans-
ported across two membranes and the intervening
aqueous periplasmic space is not understood,
but it is known to be mediated by seven essen-
tial Lpt (lipopolysaccharide transport) proteins.
The heteromeric ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
transporter LptBFG forms a complex in the in-
ner membrane with a membrane-bound protein,
LptC (Fig. 1A) (2–5). Using homologous do-
mains, the C terminus of LptC interacts with the
N terminus of LptA, and the C terminus of LptA
interacts with the N-terminal periplasmic domain
of LptD (6–9). The resulting head-to-tail oligomer
produced creates a transenvelope protein bridge
that connects the inner-membrane Lpt compo-
nents with the outer-membrane LPS translocon
(LptD and LptE) (6, 10–15). Defects in any of
the Lpt proteins cause LPS to accumulate in
the outer leaflet of the inner membrane (2, 16).
However, the mechanism of LPS transport has
been difficult to study because it involves two
membranes and seemingly cannot be broken
into different steps.

To elucidate the mechanism of LPS trans-
port, we first sought to identify sites where

LPS interacts with the Lpt proteins in vivo. We
incorporated an unnatural amino acid contain-
ing a photo–cross-linker ( p-benzoylphenylalanine,
pBPA) at 23 positions in LptC and 14 positions
in LptA (17–20). Four of the LptC mutants and
five of the LptA mutants formed cross-links
to LPS in an ultraviolet light (UV)–dependent
manner (Fig. 1, B and C). LptC adducts con-
tained the cross-linker at positions 47, 78,
172, and 182 (Fig. 1B), whereas LptA adducts
contained the cross-linker at positions 32, 36,
95, 114, and 116 (Fig. 1C). Except for residue
47 in LptC, all of these LPS adducts formed
on the inside of the b-jellyroll structures.
Residue 47 in LptC is in a disordered region
of the protein (9), which may become ordered
when it interacts with the LptBFG complex or
LPS. No cross-links from side chains on the
outer surface of the b jellyroll of LptC or LptA
were observed. Thus, we propose that LPS spe-
cifically binds inside these proteins and transits
the periplasm on the inside of the b jellyroll of
these proteins.

To determine whether LptC or LptA alone
can extract LPS from the inner membrane or
whether cross-linking to LPS is dependent on
the entire transenvelope complex, we manipu-
lated the expression levels of the Lpt compo-
nents. We overexpressed LptC or LptA alone
or in combination with the other inner-membrane
Lpt proteins (i.e., LptBFG or LptBFGC), rea-
soning that LptC and LptA would mostly not
reside in Lpt complexes if they were overex-
pressed individually. Cross-linking of LPS to
LptC at position 47, but not at positions 78, 172,
or 182, increased substantially when LptBFG
was co-overexpressed (Fig. 2A). Thus, when
LptA, LptD, and LptE are limiting, LPS accu-
mulates near residue 47 of LptC. Position 47
may be located near a strong binding site for
LPS, whereas the other cross-linking positions
may reflect more transient interactions that oc-
cur during the movement of LPS through fully
assembled bridges. Because LPS accumula-

tion at the binding site around residue 47 de-
pends on LptBFG, it is also clear that LptC
cannot extract LPS directly from the inner mem-
brane unaided.

All five LptA mutants showed increased
cross-linking with LPS when they were co-
overexpressed with LptBFGC (Fig. 2B). Thus,
LptA cannot receive LPS directly from the in-
ner membrane, but requires LptBFGC complex.
LPS must migrate out of the inner membrane in
an ordered process that requires LptBFG to get
to LptC and LptBFGC to get to LptA. Because
LPS transport between these proteins can occur
in incomplete Lpt bridges, it was possible to
develop a biochemical system to separate the
individual step of LPS release from the mem-
brane from that of the transport step along the
Lpt bridge.

To study the ATP dependence of LPS ex-
traction from the inner membrane, we first pre-
pared spheroplasts containing overexpressed
LptC(T47pBPA) and LptBFG by disrupting the
outer membrane and cell wall with ethylene-
diaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and lysozyme.
The inner membrane was then permeabilized by
osmotic shock to introduce buffer with or with-
out ATP into the cytoplasm to generate right-
side-out (RSO) membrane vesicles (21–25). These
vesicles were then irradiated with UV light.
Substantial LPS cross-linking to residue 47 of
LptC was only observed when LptBFG was co-
overexpressed and ATP was present (Fig. 3A).
A small amount of LPS was cross-linked to
LptC in the absence of ATP, but this amount did
not increase over time (Fig. 3A). Presumably this
small amount of LPS was present before gen-
erating the RSO fraction. Because cross-linking
increased as a function of time in the presence
of ATP, transfer of LPS from the inner mem-
brane to the membrane-bound LptC appears to
require energy.

We next addressed whether LPS could be
transferred to the periplasmic component, LptA,
in this in vitro system. This reconstitution re-
quires release of LPS from a membrane fraction
to a soluble periplasmic protein (fig. S1). Puri-
fied LptA(I36pBPA), which cross-linked LPS
in vivo, was added to RSO vesicles and analyzed
for cross-linking to LPS. LPS cross-linked to
LptA over time only in the presence of ATP and
when all four inner-membrane components were
overexpressed (Fig. 3B). Notably, LPS did not
cross-link to LptA in the absence of LptC over-
expression; this finding indicates that LPS must
first be transferred to LptC before being trans-
ferred to LptA, which is consistent with previous
work (9).

To confirm that the soluble periplasmic bridge
component assembled in this in vitro system re-
flects the in vivo assembly process, we tested
the specificity of this cross-linking. An LptA mu-
tant, LptA(H37pBPA), interacts directly with
LptC (6) but not with LPS in vivo (Fig. 1C).
Residues Ile36 and His37 are both located on the
edge of the b jellyroll that interacts with LptC,
