Questions Chapter 4 (The perceptron) 

1. Name the properties that made the perceptron special 
- High influence due to several properties that could not be offered by any other 

network model at that time 

1. Simple and efficient learning algorithm 
2. It’s performance could be tested due to the precisely defined terms of the model 
3. The model was complex enough to potentially offer interesting behavior while, at 
the same time, being simple enough to allow for an analysis and prediction of its 
performance 

4. Strong connection to biological systems and consistent with the known biological 

facts 

applied to the perceptron and the perceptron’s output is calculated 

2. Describe the steps of the perceptron learning algorithm 
- First, the weight vector w is initialized with small random numbers  
- Next, one of the training input vectors together with its desired target output is 
- The computed output is then compared to the desired output  
- This comparison gives us a so called error signal 
- The synaptic weights are then changed in order to minimize the error 
- The steps are repeated until no error occurs meaning that the perceptron 

classifies all training examples correctly 

function that cannot be represented 

3. What kind functions can be represented by a perceptron? Give a 
- Perceptron can only learn to recognize patterns that are linearly separable  
- Perceptrons can be trained to classify input patterns of four basic boolean 
- Simple example of a boolean function that cannot be represented is XOR

functions: AND, OR, ¬AND and ¬OR
