Seminar MM Genetik I

Daniel DÃ¶mer & Marius Musielak

 

 

Background

study of genetic interactions
1)  functional assignment of genes
2)  system-level organization

1. approach: effect of deletions in a double mutant 

But: unable to observe essential genes (non-viable mutants)
2. approach: SPA (Sequential Peptide Affinity) tag

But: mechanism of destabilization not clearly understood 
        and often causes no measurable effect in a single mutant
Solution: creation of a conditionally inducible knock down of an
essential gene combined with a chromosomal knock 
out of a nonessential
