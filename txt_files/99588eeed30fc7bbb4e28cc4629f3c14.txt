FIDUCIARY  RELATIONSHIPS

L.  S.  SEALY

THE  branch  of  equity  which  deals  with  fiduciary  relationships  does
not  receive  a  great  deal  of  attention  in  legal  works,  and  what  has
been  written  is  not  usually  very  full  or  very  precise. 
It  is  pro-
posed,  therefore,  in  this  article,  first,  to  explore  something  of  the
background  and  development  of  this topic,  secondly,  to  discuss  the
problem  of  defining  a  fiduciary  situation  and,  thirdly,  to  suggest,
in  outline  at  least,  a  classification  of  the  relationships  and  the
principles which apply  to each  class.

"  CONFIDENCE,"  TRUSTS  AND  FIDUCIARY  RELATIONSHIPS

Breach  of  trust,  or  confidence,  is  one  of  the  traditional  heads  of
jurisdiction  in  Chancery:

These three  give place in  court  of  conscience,
Fraud,  accident,  and  breach  of  confidence.1

From  this  branch  of  equity  we derive,  of  course,  the  whole  of  our
law  of  trusts;  but  matters  of  confidence  in  earlier  times  covered  a
good  deal  more  ground  than  trusts  of  property  as  we  know  then1
today.  In  the  reports  of  eighteenth-  and  early  nineteenth-century
cases we find the word used in many different  contexts.  A was said
to  have  confidence  reposed  in  him  by  B  not  only  where  B  had
entrusted  A with  property  to  hold  and  deal  with  on  behalf  of  him-
self  or  others—as  in  the  trust  strictly  so  called—but  also  where  A
undertook  to  exercise  a  power,  to  conduct  a  sale,  to  supervise  an
estate or business, or in some other  way to become B's  employee  or
agent.  Confidence  was  also reposed  where  B  was  dependent  on  A's
advice,  perhaps  because  A was  a  professional  adviser  or  expert,  or
more  familiar  with  the  subject-matter;  because  A was  on  the  spot
and  B  at  a  distance;  or because  A was a  trusted  servant  or  friend,
or  a  person  of  dominant  character  or  position  who  was  able  to
influence  B's  decisions.  Again,  confidence  might  be  induced  where
A by  words  or  conduct  represented  to  B  that  he  would  deal  fairly
with  him. 
In  all  these  cases  the  broad  general  principle  applied
was
