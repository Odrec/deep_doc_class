Ensemble vs. individual 

Fluctuations can be detected on the level of individual molecules 
No synchronization is required, analysis of multistep processes 

Heterogeneity in the sample can be resolved

Objective for focusing into a diffraction-limited  

confocal volume (not for imaging) 

Confocal detection 

Confocal volume: ~ 1fL 
1nM = 0.6 molecules/fL 

Residence time of diffusing molecules in the confocal volume: 

depends on diffusion constant: 1-100 ms 

Typical single molecule confocal detection 

µs time resolution, possible combination with TCSPC 

“Photon bursts” 

At low concentration of labeled species, a burst of photons is detected 

upon entering into the confocal volume 

Accumulation of photon bursts over time 

Information: amplitude, length, fine structure

Rotation of the FOF1 ATP synthase in liposomes 

Three different FRET efficiencies during rotation:

Quantitative single molecule FRET 

Quantitative FRET analysis requires knowledge about the presence of 

donor and acceptor on an individual molecule 

Probing the presence of the acceptor by a second laser 

 CW excitation: alternating laser excitation (ALEX) 

 TR excitation: Pulsed interleave excitation (PIE)
