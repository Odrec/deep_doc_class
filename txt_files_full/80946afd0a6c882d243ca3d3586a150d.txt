Summary. — The rural economy of Lesotho is characterized by dependence on circular labor
migration to South African mines and declining agricultural output per capita. This paper attempts
to improve the understanding of the relationship between circular labor migration and agricultural
production by comparing the technical e(cid:129)ciency of farms that supply migrant laborers with that of
farms that do not. Through analysis of the relative technical e(cid:129)ciency of these two farm categories
conclusions are drawn concerning the likely impact of changing migration patterns on the
agricultural sector. (cid:211) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

1. INTRODUCTION

It would be di(cid:129)cult

to exaggerate the
signiﬁcance of labor migration in Lesotho(cid:213)s
economy. Over a quarter of the male labor
force of Lesotho is engaged in mine employ-
ment in South Africa. These workers are typi-
cally on ﬁxed-term contracts
spanning 12
months which require them to return to Leso-
tho before a renewal. The migrants’ remittances
make up over 80% of factor income from
abroad which constituted 40% to 50% of
Lesotho’s gross national product during 1983–
91 with a marginal decline in subsequent years
(Bureau of Statistics, 1992; Cobbe, 1995). At
the household level, remittances from migrant
laborers in South Africa are the main source of
income for about 35% of homesteads and 70%
of households have had at least one member as
a migrant worker. Similar oscillatory labor
migration has been signiﬁcant in the economies
of Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland
and Zimbabwe.

Recent social, political and economic transi-
tions in South Africa have made the future of
circular labor ﬂows uncertain and raised ques-
tions about
reduced

impact of

the social

remittance ﬂows in the region (Leliveld, 1997;
Crush & James, 1995; Gustafsson & Makon-
nen, 1993). By 1997, South African mine
employment had fallen by one-third from its
level
in the mid-1980s and the number of
miners from Lesotho had fallen to its lowest
level since the early 1970s. Further retrench-
ments in mining employment appear likely. The
implications of
for
employment in South Africa and the policy
response to this threat depend on the relation-
ship between oscillatory labor migration and

complementary, reduced mining employment
will issue a double blow to the economy.

The unresolved question concerning labor
migration and agricultural production is
whether remittance incomes enhance produc-
tion enough to compensate for the reduced
availability of labor in any speciﬁc setting. The
impacts of both remittance income and labor
migration have generated a large literature.
Among others, Murray (1981) and Stark (1980)
argue that remittance ﬂows can be critical for
enhanced agricultural
investment and farm
management. Rempel and Lobdell (1978) and
Palmer (1985) in contrast, stress the potential
for remittances to substitute for rural produc-
tion or be modest in volume.1 Francis and
Hoddinott(cid:213)s (1993) detailed case study of a
Kenyan community indicates that migration
has facilitated investment in education, not
agriculture. Francis and Hoddinott(cid:213)s analysis
uncovers a residual
impact of migration on
household income, but not on agricultural
productivity. Aside from village case studies,
empirical analyses relating circular migration to
agricultural productivity remain limited. With
the exception of Lucas (1985), analyses of the
national or sectoral impact of migration in sub-
Saharan African tend to emphasize either the
positive role of remittances or the negative
eects of reduced labor, increased consumption
and inﬂation (IBRD, 1990; Plath, Holland &
Carvalho, 1987).

to assess

This paper uses a detailed microeconomic
data set
the impact of circular
migration on Lesotho(cid:213)s agricultural sector. The
analysis is motivated by a need to understand
whether agricultural production is likely to
mitigate the eects of
reduced remittance
income or become a victim of it. The study uses
a stochastic frontier model (Aigner, Lovell &
Schmidt, 1977) to assess the technical ine(cid:129)-
ciency of farms currently sending migrants and
those that do not. Given the fungibility of
money, this approach may suggest more about
the impact of receipts on agricultural output
than survey questions concerning the volume
and use of remittance income. The analysis
focuses on agricultural production, rather than
household income, to ascertain sectoral impacts
of changes in migration patterns. It concen-
trates on the current impact of remittances
rather than their residual eects to assess the
immediate consequences of reduced migration
for agricultural output.

Until recently, mining jobs have been allo-
cated through a queuing process in which

among

households

essentially all rural households participated.2
Consequently, the central dierence between
households with migrant remittances and those
without is the relative availability of ﬁnance
and labor. If households currently sending
migrants can be assumed to have more cash
than those without migrant income, compari-
son of the two groups sheds light on the
importance of ﬁnancial
liquidity for agricul-
tural production. A ﬁnding of lower technical
ine(cid:129)ciency
supplying
migrants would imply that greater access to
capital through remittances generates increased
agricultural productivity, despite the reduced
availability of labor. By contrast, lower tech-
nical ine(cid:129)ciency in nonmigrant farms would
suggest that labor migration is currently detri-
mental to agricultural production. Meanwhile,
any dierence in farm e(cid:129)ciency between the
two groups would suggest: (a) that there are
options to improve agricultural output using
existing production technologies and (b) that
in factor markets may constrain

management
to diering degrees based on
household supplies of labor or ﬁnance.

2. CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

The theoretical model posits a production
possibilities frontier that maps out the maxi-
mum possible output for any combination of
input quantities. Such a frontier can be esti-
mated based on a production function that
relates output (y) to inputs (cid:133)x1 . . . xn(cid:134) such that
y (cid:136) f(cid:133)x1 . . . xn(cid:134). Following Farrel
(1957),
measurement of technical ine(cid:129)ciency is based
on a comparison of
the output actually
obtained and the output that the production
function would predict for the level of inputs
used. Because rainfall and other agricultural
inputs cannot be controlled, some deviation
between actual and predicted output is expec-
ted for all
farms. Systematic dierences in
degrees of technical ine(cid:129)ciency between groups
would imply, however,
that one group is
persistently less able to apply inputs as eec-
tively as
the other. Hence, a relationship
between migrancy status and technical ine(cid:129)-
ciency can suggest whether circular migration
facilitates or hampers farm management.

Technical

ine(cid:129)ciency is a measure of
management error, rather than income or gross
output. Lower ine(cid:129)ciency does not correspond
to greater yields or greater income. By applying
fewer inputs in a consistent and timely manner,

score

than a

e(cid:129)ciency

a ‘‘low-input’’ farmer could achieve a better
technical
farmer
employing more inputs and achieving a higher
yield. In this case, the ‘‘high input’’ farmer
generates greater yields, but does not come as
close to the maximum possible yield from the
inputs applied. There are a number of reasons
why one group might
tend toward greater
ine(cid:129)ciency than another. A group with
consistently greater ine(cid:129)ciency levels could
have relatively poor access to extension advice,
a feature that sometimes describes female-
headed households (Due, Magayane & Temu,
1997). Alternatively, such a group may consist
of less skilled or less motivated farmers. Farms
owned by absentee landlords might fall into
such a category. Similarly, technical ine(cid:129)ciency
might be exacerbated if access to remittances
encouraged resident household members to
attend less to farm production and more to
other activities. Finally, one group might be
disadvantaged in its ability to adjust to intra-
annual changes in farm conditions. Because
timing is critical
in agricultural production,
knowledgeable and motivated farmers who are
resource-poor may be less able to apply inputs
in a consistent manner than those with greater
access to resources. For example, a farmer may
prepare and plant an area of land anticipating
access to an appropriate amount of weeding
labor in the future. Since the amount of weed-
ing required will depend on the volume and
timing of rainfall, no farmer can perfectly
forecast how much labor the activity will
require or when it will be needed. When
weeding becomes necessary, farmers who are
less able to mobilize su(cid:129)cient labor rapidly are
more likely to employ labor less eectively.
These farmers will have lower yields and
greater ine(cid:129)ciency measures than those who
were able to employ the same input levels on
the schedule of
their choosing. Poverty or
rigidities in factor markets may contribute to
variation in technical
ine(cid:129)ciency based on
dierential access to labor or ﬁnance.

3. THE GENESIS OF MIGRANT LABOR

SYSTEM

Oscillatory labor migration is a well-docu-
mented phenomenon that has been part of
Southern Africa’s economic landscape for over
a century (Ketso, 1991; Murray, 1980; Strom,
1978). Labor migration from Lesotho evolved
following the loss of a territory in protracted

comparative

conﬂicts with the Boers in the 19th century; the
closure of South African food markets to
exports of Basotho producers; and the estab-
lishment of rail-lines in South Africa which
enhanced the
advantage of
producers in other regions. Men from Lesotho
sought mine employment in larger numbers by
the beginning of the 20th century (Stichter,
1985). The pressure for payment of head-taxes
combined with high mine wages and declining
agricultural productivity created strong incen-
tives to migrate. The number of migrants
increased signiﬁcantly after independence until
the 1970s. Since then, the number of migrants
has ﬂuctuated but remained well above 100, 000
from a total
labor force of about 450, 000.
Diminished recruitment of mine workers from
Malawi and Mozambique, together with soar-
ing gold prices, caused the real mine wages to
double
(Stahl, 1981). This
produced a phenomenal rise in the remittances
to Lesotho. During the 1980s, internal political
pressures and economic sanctions on South
Africa intensiﬁed, gold prices plunged, and the
retrenchment of mine workers became more
prominent. Nonetheless, mine wages rose stea-
dily, leading to a sustained rise in remittances
to Lesotho.

in the 1970s

Today’s oscillatory migration from Lesotho
consists mostly of mine workers, usually men
between 20 and 40 years of age. Until 1990,
mining companies were required by law to
withhold 60% of the mine income as deferred
pay, deposited in Lesotho Bank for use when
the miners returned to Lesotho. The residual
40% remained at the disposal of the migrants
while at
the mines. In 1990 the Lesotho
government yielded to the demands of miners,
reducing the deferred pay to 30% of miners(cid:213)
income. Of the salary paid at the mines, a

Agricultural growth over 1987–97 averaged
0.9% annually compared to population growth
of 2.2% (World Bank, 1998). The unstable
situation of migrant employment
in South
Africa raises the possibility of mass retrench-
ment and dramatic declines in national and
household income (Gustafsson & Makonnen,
1993). Whether changes in labor ﬂows would
enhance or diminish technical e(cid:129)ciency in
agricultural production will be assessed in this
analysis.

tered to 316 households. Sixteen farm units
were dropped from the sample either because
they did not actually control any ﬁelds or
because they had received free inputs through a
development project. The questionnaire elicited
information on farm management for each plot
of land the household controlled. Data on the
value and volume of inputs and outputs were
collected using local units of measure. Kilo-
gram equivalents to the units of volume were
determined through a sampling process, and
local units were converted to kilograms.

4. EMPIRICAL MODEL

(a) Data and variable deﬁnition

The data used in this study come from a 1995
survey of 152 farms sending migrant labor
(migrant farms) and 148 farms that were not
supplying migrants (nonmigrant farms). Data
were collected for one cropping cycle in the
four districts of Butha-Buthe, Leribe, Berea
and Maseru in the lowlands of Lesotho. These
sites were selected based on their large share of
total crop production and rural population.
Within these districts, villages were selected in
which ﬁelds had recently been measured by sta
from Lesotho(cid:213)s Bureau of Statistics or in the
context of development projects. Lists of all
grain farmers in the villages were assembled,
and local
informants sorted these lists into
migrant and nonmigrant categories. Migrant
farms were deﬁned as those that had at least
one household member as a migrant worker in
South Africa during the cropping cycle for
which data were collected. The lists for each
district were

The analysis is limited to maize, sorghum and
wheat which are the three major cereal crops

the dependent variable as output of maize,

Cropping patterns found in the sample are
indicated in Table 1. Migrant and nonmigrant
farms showed similar patterns in crop choices
with almost all farms growing maize and about
5% of each group growing wheat. Sampled
farms in both classes had average landholdings
of six acres and planted about the same area to
each crop. Table 2 reveals dierences between
the two groups with respect to management of
those crops. In terms of maize cultivation,
farms supplying migrants applied more fertil-
izer, less seed and less labor. These dierences
are statistically signiﬁcant at 1%. The dierence

in average maize yield between the two farm
groups, however, is not statistically signiﬁcant.
The data reveal a similar pattern of statistically
signiﬁcant dierences in fertilizer, seed, and
labor application to sorghum, with migrant
farms applying more fertilizer, less seed and less
labor. There is a statistically signiﬁcant dier-
ence in sorghum yields favoring the nonmigrant
farms. For wheat the dierence in yields is
statistically signiﬁcant, with higher yields on
migrant farms, but dierences in application
rates are not signiﬁcant at the 5% level. Given
the sample size, results for wheat must be
treated cautiously. Overall, the data suggest
that
laborers
attempt to use purchased inputs to compensate
for reduced household labor and that yields
and output levels do not dier appreciably
across the two groups. It is not immediately
clear whether one farm group or the other

random eects models (Lovell, 1993; Battese,

stochastic
called
composed-error model, proposed in indepen-
dent works of Aigner et al. (1977) and Meeusen
and Van den Broeck (1977). This model
measures deviation from technical e(cid:129)ciency

The approach posits a production function,

farm k and x is input. The term e(cid:15)k implies a
stochastic production frontier that varies across
farms or over time for the same farm. The error
term, (cid:15)k, is composed of two parts, vk and uk,
such that (cid:15)k (cid:136) vk (cid:135) uk. The term vk is stochastic
with a symmetric distribution ((cid:255)1 < vk < 1);
this term captures the random eects of factors
beyond a farmer’s control as well as measure-
ment error. Meanwhile, uk represents the eect
of farmer error and has a one-sided distribution
(u 6 0). The sign of a one-sided error term, uk,
guarantees that all observations lie on or below

form for this
analysis cannot be determined a priori. Rather,
the functional form must reﬂect the speciﬁc
economic environment characterized by the
data. Misspeciﬁcation of a functional form will
lead to overestimation of technical ine(cid:129)ciencies
in production. We conduct speciﬁcation tests
for each subsample separately to ensure suit-
able speciﬁcation and ﬁt for both types of
farms. In addition to speciﬁcation error, omit-
ted variables will lead to exaggerated estimates
of technical ine(cid:129)ciency. The omission of envi-
ronmental variables from the data probably
introduced some bias in our results. As long as
both groups are aected similarly by omitted
variables, comparisons of technical e(cid:129)ciency
remain valid. Two functions were considered,
in log form:

b is a vector of parameters of the model; and (cid:15)
is the composed error term.

Following Green (1990), the ﬁt oered by the
C–D as opposed to the translog function was
compared by testing linear restrictions on the
translog using F-tests. Data for the migrant and
nonmigrant farms were tested separately using
ordinary least squares (OLS) residual sum of
squares prior to decomposition of the error
term. In both data sets, the parameters for
square and cross terms found in the translog
version were not signiﬁcantly dierent from
zero at a 5% level of signiﬁcance. As a result,
the Cobb–Douglas form was used in the anal-
ysis.

The models were estimated using a maximum
likelihood procedure. The symmetric error term
(m) is assumed to be independently and identi-
cally distributed while the one-sided error
component
is speciﬁed with a half-normal

distribution (Aigner, Lovell & Schmidt, 1977).
Hence, f(cid:133)u(cid:134) (cid:136) (cid:133)2=p(cid:134)1=2e(cid:255)(cid:133)1=2(cid:134)(cid:133)u2=r2

5. RESULTS

(a) Parameter estimates

The maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) of
migrant and nonmigrant models are presented
in Table 3. OLS estimates were used as the
initial set of parameters, followed by iterations
leading to the ﬁnal set of estimates contained in
the table. The analysis of technical e(cid:129)ciency is
concerned primarily with the error terms rather
than the parameter estimates, but a few obser-
vations about the parameters are in order. First,
the results for the migrant and nonmigrant
households are quite similar. As one would
expect, parameters maintain the same signs
across the data sets and the respective log-like-
lihood values do not diverge substantially from
one another. In both farm groups, the estimates
for tractor power and animal draft power are
not statistically signiﬁcant. The coe(cid:129)cients on
seed and labor input are signiﬁcant at the 1%
level for migrant and nonmigrant results. The

expect those who share-out to have relatively

because sharecropping distracts attention from

(b) Average and farm-speciﬁc technical

ine(cid:129)ciency estimates

For the migrant farms, the average technical
ine(cid:129)ciency index is 0.24, implying that their
production is 76% of its potential. Technical
ine(cid:129)ciency indices ranged from 0.12 to 0.36
across the nonmigrant farms, with 75% of them
achieving above the group(cid:213)s average technical
e(cid:129)ciency. Similar calculations for the nonmi-
grant farms resulted in an average technical
ine(cid:129)ciency measure of 0.36,
indicating that
they achieve only 64% of the technically feasi-
ble output. The farm speciﬁc ine(cid:129)ciency indices
for the nonmigrant farms varied from 0.12 to
0.56, and 76% of these farms had technical

e(cid:129)ciency levels above the group(cid:213)s average.
Sixty-three percent of the nonmigrant farms
have ine(cid:129)ciency indices of 0.25 or greater as
opposed to 21% of migrant farms (Table 4).
Only 5% of the migrant farms have ine(cid:129)ciency
indices of 0.30 or more whereas more than 40%
of the nonmigrants have ine(cid:129)ciency rates in

The ﬁnding of greater technical ine(cid:129)ciency
among nonmigrant households implies that
they are at some disadvantage in their ability to
apply the resources that they allocate to farm-
ing. It appears that the absence of remittance
income makes it more di(cid:129)cult to follow a
consistent,
timely farm management regime
than does the absence of household members.
This ﬁnding suggests that households with
more ﬁnance (through remittances) can be
more responsive to farm management needs
than households with more resident

with relatively large endowments of labor may

a Technical ine(cid:129)ciency estimates are calculated from the
respective production functions in Table 3. Larger rela-
tive deviations from technical e(cid:129)ciency do not neces-
sarily reﬂect larger absolute losses in potential output.

labor in this way does not provide funds for
immediate use on farm, does not provide a level
of income comparable to mine wages, and
cannot enhance the ability to manage the
household(cid:213)s own land.

Aside

from highlighting dierences
in
productivity between the two groups,
the
results suggest a potential to increase produc-
tion on all farms and considerable uncertainty
in output. Farm-level
ine(cid:129)ciency indices in
excess of 0.20 are common among migrants and
nonmigrants, indicating that producers in both
categories could increase output using existing
farm technologies. Management, however,
cannot address all the challenges to production
in Lesotho. The relative signiﬁcance of factors
beyond the farmers(cid:213) control on deviations from
potential output is reﬂected in the ratio of
standard errors, k. For both sets of farms,
factors beyond the farmers(cid:213) control account for
a large share of the deviation from potential
output (Table 3). Hence, unavoidable environ-
mental eects can be expected to generate
considerable dierences in productivity across
farms and over time even under the best
possible management practices.
Improved
technology to shift
the production frontier
could address this problem.

(c) Eects of farm-size and gender

The existence of productivity dierences
associated with farm size has been an important
issue in agricultural development for decades
(Bardhan, 1973; Kevane, 1996). The question

of farm size and productivity is of interest in
Lesotho because a shift from circular migration
to permanent out-migration could inﬂuence
farm sizes in the country. This study stratiﬁes
the data into very small (<6 acres), small (6–10
acres) and medium (>10 acres) farms to esti-
mate the eects of farm size on productivity.
The results suggest that technical e(cid:129)ciency is
independent of farm size although it diers by
migrancy status. Among migrants, ine(cid:129)ciency
indices are 0.24, 0.25, and 0.25 for very small,
small, and medium farms, respectively. Similar
estimates are 0.36, 0.35 and 0.35 among the
nonmigrants
same order. Within
migrancy classes,
the dierences were not
statistically signiﬁcant. Ceteris paribus, an
increase farm sizes within the current range
would have no eect on technical e(cid:129)ciency.

in the

experience

employment

It is sometimes suggested that women left on
farms without the beneﬁt of male labor are at a
disadvantage compared to other households.
Low (1986) argues that farm households in
Southern Africa whose male members have left
for mine
lower
productivity per acre and per worker because of
changes in the quality and quantity of house-
hold labor. Palmer (1985) argues that labor
migration reduces farm output and women(cid:213)s
welfare in Lesotho because of the low volume
of remittances, the loss of male household
labor,
the high cost of hired labor, and
constraints on the use of mining income. Any
special impacts of migration on female-headed
households are not reﬂected in the technical
ine(cid:129)ciency of their farms. The average techni-
cal
ine(cid:129)ciency is 0.24 for female and male
managers in the migrant sample. Among the
nonmigrants, female managers achieve 63% of
potential output while male farm managers
average 65%. Within each migrancy group, the
gender-based estimates are not signiﬁcantly
dierent from the sample estimates, suggesting
no gender bias in technical ine(cid:129)ciency. But,
because female-headed households are not
equally represented in the two groups, analysis
based on gender that did not account
for
migrancy status would indicate a spurious
gender dierence in productivity.

The ﬁnding that male and female farm
managers both beneﬁt from having a household
member away is consistent with research
showing that poverty can explain many of the
dierences between female-headed households
and other households (Kennedy & Peters, 1992;
Fortman, 1984). Nonetheless, the absence of a
gender dierence in technical e(cid:129)ciency of cereal

or

farm practices

production may be consistent with female-
headed households engaging in signiﬁcantly
dierent
experiencing
substantially dierent yields and incomes.
Similar ine(cid:129)ciency indices implies that
the
female-headed households are applying the
inputs they use as eectively as other house-
holds apply their inputs. The level of inputs,
however, may dier by gender.

As Table 5 shows, input levels on maize ﬁelds
did not dier
substantially by gender of
household head within migrancy groups.
Female-headed households tended to apply less
labor than other households, but the dierence
is only statistically signiﬁcant among the
nonmigrant households. The highest yields in
maize were achieved by female-headed house-
holds in the migrant group. Female-headed
households without migrants
reported the
lowest yields. The sample size was too small to
allow a gender analysis of sorghum or wheat
production. In the production of maize (the
most widely grown staple) input levels and
management do not appear to be inﬂuenced by
gender of household head, at
least among
migrant farms. Among the nonmigrant farms,
female-headed households may apply fewer
inputs and achieve commensurately lower
yields.

6. CONCLUDING REMARKS

farms not sending migrants. Yields of maize
and sorghum do not dier signiﬁcantly by
migrancy status. We ﬁnd no evidence that farm
size or the gender of household head aects
technical ine(cid:129)ciency, once migrancy status is
accounted for. The results suggest that remit-
tances facilitate current agricultural produc-
tion, rather than substitute for it. This implies
that reduced opportunities for labor migration
would cause not only reduced remittance
income but also reduced technical e(cid:129)ciency in
agricultural production.
