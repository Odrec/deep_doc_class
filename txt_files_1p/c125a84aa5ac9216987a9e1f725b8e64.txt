The wife issued a claim for ancillary relief under section 23 of the Matrimonial
Causes Act 19731 against her husband, who was the sole owner of a number of
complexly structured o›shore companies. The wife alleged that the husband had
used the companies to hold legal title to properties which belonged beneÞcially to
him. However, the husband failed to comply with orders for the full and frank
disclosure of his Þnancial position and the companies, which were joined as parties to
the proceedings, failed to Þle a defence or to comply with orders for disclosure. The
judge rejected the wifeÕs submission that the husband had been guilty of any
impropriety in relation to the companies such as would ordinarily entitle the court to
pierce the corporate veil, but held that, in matrimonial proceedings for ancillary relief,
section 24(1)(a) of the 1973 Act conferred a wider jurisdiction to pierce the corporate
veil. The judge concluded that, since the husband had the practical ability to procure
the transfer of the properties, he was ÔÔentitledÕÕ to them within the meaning of
section 24(1)(a), giving the court jurisdiction to make a transfer order in respect of
them. Accordingly, he ordered the husband to transfer or cause to be transferred to
the wife six properties and an interest in a seventh which were held in the name of two
of the husbandÕs companies. The Court of Appeal by a majority allowed an appeal by
the companies, holding that the Family DivisionÕs practice of treating the assets of
companies substantially owned by one party to the marriage as available for
distribution under section 24(1)(a) was beyond the jurisdiction of the court unless the
corporate personality of the company was being abused for a purpose which was in
some relevant respect improper or, on the particular facts, it could be shown that an
asset legally owned by the company was held in trust for the husband and that, since
the judge had rejected both of those possibilities, he ought not to have made the order.
