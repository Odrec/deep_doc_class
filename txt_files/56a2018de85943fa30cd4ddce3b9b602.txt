Insights and Blindspots of the
Cognitivist Theory of Emotions

Andrea Scarantino

ABSTRACT

Philosophical cognitivists have argued for more than four decades that emotions are
special types of judgments. Anti-cognitivists have provided a series of counterexamples
aiming to show that identifying emotions with judgments overintellectualizes the emo-
tions. I provide a novel counterexample that makes the overintellectualization charge
especially vivid. I discuss neurophysiological evidence to the effect that the fear system
can be activated by stimuli the subject is unaware of seeing. To emphasize the analogy
with blindsight, I call this phenomenon blindfright. Cognitivists may reply that blind-
fright is nothing but an unconscious judgment subcortically elicited. This reply is in line
with the strategy commonly employed by cognitivists against their critics. I call it the
Elastic Strategy, because it consists of ‘stretching’ the notion of judgment in order to
accommodate counterexamples. This strategy, I argue, turns cognitivism into a theory
that is at worst unfalsiﬁable and at best trivially true. The ﬁnal portion of my article aims
to rescue cognitivism from the damage done by the Elastic Strategy. I distinguish three
varieties of cognitivism, one concerned with what emotions essentially are (Constitutive
Cognitivism), one concerned with what causes emotions (Etiological Cognitivism) and
one concerned with what emotions represent (Representational Cognitivism). I conclude
that what cognitivism has to offer to emotion theory are primarily insights concerning the
causes and representational content of emotions. The constitutive identiﬁcation of emo-
tions with judgments, on the other hand, does more harm than good.

1 Introduction

Philosophical cognitivists have long argued that emotions are special types of
judgments (Solomon [1976], [2003]; Nussbaum [2001]).1 This thesis has been
widely criticized, because judgments appear to have distinguishing properties
emotions lack (e.g., cognitive sophistication) and lack distinguishing proper-
ties emotions have (e.g., motivational power) (cf. Deigh [1994]; Grifﬁths
[1997]; DeLancey [2001]; D’Arms and Jacobson [2003]; Prinz [2004]).
Cognitivists have been largely unfazed by criticisms of this sort. Their stand-
ard reaction is to ﬁne-tune the notion of judgment, and reply that, relative to
such notion, emotions are indeed judgments. The purpose of this article is to
move beyond this standard dialectic, which mixes terminological disputes on
what judgments are with substantive disagreements on the nature of emotions.
The paper can be divided into three parts. In the ﬁrst, I present a new
counterexample to cognitivism, an emotion I call blindfright. Blindfright is a
type of fear elicited without awareness of the eliciting stimulus, in circum-
stances analogous to those in which blindsight is manifested. Besides being an
interesting phenomenon in its own right, blindfright is a striking example of
what is wrong with the identiﬁcation of emotions with judgments, under the
understanding of judgment presupposed by anti-cognitivists. Cognitivists,
however, reject such an understanding, and adopt what I call the Elastic
Strategy. The strategy consists of stretching the notion of ‘judgment’ in
order to accommodate counterexamples. Blindfright is bound to lead cogni-
tivists to add the notion of a subcortical judgment to the already motley crew of
items that qualify as judgments by cognitivists’ lights.

In the second part of my paper, I explain what is wrong with the Elastic
Strategy. In a nutshell, it has turned cognitivism into a theory that is (at best)
trivially true. Furthermore, the Elastic Strategy has led cognitivists and
anti-cognitivists to talk past each other; while they respectively afﬁrm and
deny that emotions are judgments, they mean different things by ‘judgment’.
Finally, the Elastic Strategy has prevented anti-cognitivists from gaining an
appreciation of the insights of the cognitivist research program.

In the third part of my paper, I try to rescue cognitivism from the damage
done by the Elastic Strategy. I distinguish between three varieties of cognitiv-
ism that have been historically important in philosophy and in the sciences of
mind. One is concerned with the essential nature of emotions (Constitutive

1 Other versions of cognitivism in philosophy are less radical (see, e.g., Deigh [1994] for further
discussion). Greenspan ([1998]), for example, offers a cognitivist theory that makes room for the
feeling dimension of emotions by suggesting that emotions are feelings of comfort or discomfort
towards a stimulus-directed thought. Marks ([1984]) offers a belief and desire theory which
makes room for the motivational dimension of emotions, proposing that an emotion results
from the conjunction of a belief and a strong desire. I will disregard varieties of philosophical
cognitivism distinct from pure judgmentalism in what follows.
