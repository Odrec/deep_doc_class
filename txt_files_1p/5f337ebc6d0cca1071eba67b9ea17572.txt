How to Read a Poem

Dubourgh to him was but a fool;
He played melodious without rule,
And sung the feats of Fin McCool,

The giant . . .

The rhyme scheme in the poem is a kind of comic ritual in itself. Dunkin
uses  some  deliberately  inept  rhymes  (‘scurvy’/‘topsy-turvy’,  ‘from  it’/
‘vomit’, ‘dead aunt’/‘pedant’), but the real comic effect is reaped from the
way the ﬁrst three lines of each verse (which are iambic tetrameters) set up
a rhythm which is suddenly disrupted by the ﬁnal, lamely tacked-on phrase.
These ﬁnal phrases come after a slight pause, during which the reader just
has  time  to  wonder  what  monstrously  over-ingenious  rhyme  is  about  to 
be  perpetrated.  The  ﬁnal  phrase,  with  its  brief  trisyllabic  lilt,  is  inevitably
bathetic:

Each blithesome damsel shews her shape,
Enough to burst her stays and tape,
And bangs the boards: the ﬁddlers scrape
Their cat-guts:

Brave C–, foe to popish dogs,
In boots, as cumbersome as clogs,
Displays his parts, and B––jogs

His fat guts.

The  ﬁnal  phrases,  almost  afterthoughts,  are  too  laconic  to  bear  the  em-
phasis which the verse throws on them, and this itself is a comic effect. The
phrases are necessary to round off the sense of each stanza, yet rhythmically
speaking they seem like feebly superﬂuous gestures. Each stanza thus seems
to  end  on  an  embarrassing  anti-climax,  as  the  speaking  voice  trails  away. 
It is as though the sense needs these phrases but the metre does not, since
it  and  its  trim,  triple  rhyme  are  already  complete  in  themselves.  This  ten-
sion  between  feeling  that  the  phrases  are  internal  to  the  verses,  yet  also 
pointlessly external to them, is a kind of wit.

Imagery

Finally,  a  word  about  imagery.  Just  as  rhyme,  metre  and  texture  involve 
an  interplay  of  difference  and  identity,  so  do  most  images.  Similes  and
