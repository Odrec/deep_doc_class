Abstract

This study examined the production and perception of English vowels by native Korean (NK) learners of
English on two occasions separated by about 1 year. A preliminary experiment revealed that NK adults
classiﬁed some pairs of contrastive English vowels using two different Korean vowels whereas other pairs
showed classiﬁcation overlap,
implying they would be difﬁcult for Korean learners of English to
discriminate. In two subsequent experiments, NK adults and children differing in length of residence in
North America (3 vs. 5 years; 4 groups of 18 each) were compared to age-matched native English (NE)
speakers. In Experiment 2, NK children were found to discriminate English vowels more accurately than
/
were elicited using a picture-naming task. Some vowels produced by NK children were heard as intended
signiﬁcantly more often than vowels produced by NK adults. Acoustic analyses revealed that NK children
produced signiﬁcantly larger between-vowel contrasts than NK adults but did not differ from NE children.

NK adults but less accurately than NE children. In Experiment 3, English words containing /i I eI e æ > e
