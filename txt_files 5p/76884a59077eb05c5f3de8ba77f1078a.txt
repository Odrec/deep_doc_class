Individual  Rights  Under  State Constitutions  in  1868

I. 

Introduction
Much of the  academic  writing  about constitutional  law  and  theory,  both
in  the  originalist  and  non-originalist  camps,  presumes  that  the  Constitution
protects  at least  some fundamental  rights.  Most originalists  reject substantive
due  process  and  argue  alongside  Justice  Hugo  Black  and  former  Judge
Robert  H.  Bork  that  the  only  fundamental  rights  that  are  protected  are  the
ones  enumerated  in  the  Constitution.'  Other  originalists  such  as  Judge
Michael  McConnell  have  written  that  the Privileges  or Immunities  Clause  of
the  Fourteenth  Amendment  protects  both  enumerated  and  unenumerated
rights so  long  as  those rights are  deeply rooted  in history  and  tradition.2  The
Supreme  Court  has  shown  some  sympathy  to  this  latter  approach. 
In
Washington  v.  Glucksberg,3  the  Justices  declined  to  recognize  a  right  to
assisted  suicide because  they  found  such  a right  was  not deeply rooted  in  our
history  and tradition.4  A  majority  of the  Court  in  Glucksberg thus  adopted
the  approach  to  unenumerated  rights  advocated  by Justice  Antonin  Scalia 5 in
Michael H.  v.  Gerald D.  Scalia  argued  for  the  protection  of only  those  un-
enumerated  rights  that  are  deeply  rooted  in  American  history  and  tradition
when  viewed at the  most specific  level  of generality  identifiable.6

Other  Supreme  Court  Justices  have  also  argued  for  looking  to  history
and tradition  to  determine  what  unenumerated  rights,  if any,  the  Fourteenth
Amendment  might  protect.  Thus,  in  Moore  v.  City  of East  Cleveland,7
Justice  Lewis  Powell  called  for  such  an  inquiry. 8  In Bowers  v.  Hardwick,9

1.  See  Griswold  v.  Connecticut,  381  U.S.  479,  509-10  (1965)  (Black,  J.,  dissenting)  ("I  get
nowhere  in this  case  by talk  about  a constitutional  'right  of privacy'  as  an  emanation  from  one  or
more  constitutional  provisions.... 
I  am... compelled  to  admit  that  government  has  a  right  to
invade  it  unless  prohibited  by  some  specific  constitutional  provision.");  ROBERT  H.  BORK,  THE
TEMPTING  OF  AMERICA:  THE  POLITICAL  SEDUCTION  OF  THE  LAW  118  (1990)  (objecting  to  the
"vaporous"  nature  of substantive  due  process  by  arguing  that  "judge-created  phrases  specify  no
particular  freedom,  but merely  assure us,  in sonorous phrases,  that  they, the judges, will  know what
freedoms  are  required  when  the  time  comes");  Michael  W.  McConnell,  The  Right to Die and the
Jurisprudence of  Tradition, 1997  UTAH  L.  REv.  665,  666-67  (describing  the  originalist  view  of
substantive due process).

2.  See  McConnell,  supra note  1,  at  692  ("If there  is  any  textually  and  historically  plausible
authorization  for  the  protection  of  unenumerated  rights,  it  is  to  be  found  in  [the  Privileges  or
Immunities] Clause  .... ").

an  attempt  to  limit  and  guide  interpretation  of the  Clause,  we  have  insisted  not  merely  that  the
interest  denominated  as  a  'liberty'  be  'fundamental' 
(a  concept  that,  in  isolation,  is  hard  to
objectify),  but also that  it be an  interest  traditionally protected  by  our society.").

Texas  Law Review

[Vol.  87:7

Justice  Byron  White  declined  to  find  a  right  to  engage  in  sodomy  in  part
because  such  a  right  was  not  deeply  rooted  in  history  and  tradition.' 0  Other
Justices  have  said  more  vaguely  that  the  only  unenumerated  rights  the
Fourteenth  Amendment  protects  are  those  that  are  fundamental  (Justice
Frankfurter")  or  that  are  implicit  in  the  concept  of ordered  liberty  (Justice
Cardozo 2  and the  second Justice  Harlan' 3).  Presumably  any  such  rights that
exist  would  have  a  long  historical  pedigree.  It  is  possible  but  unlikely  that
fundamental  rights or  rights implicit  in  the  concept  of ordered  liberty  would
not also be deeply  rooted in our history  and tradition.

All  of this  raises  the  question  that  we  seek  to  address  in  this  Article:
Exactly  what  fundamental  rights  did  most  Americans  recognize  and  enjoy
when the  Fourteenth  Amendment  was enacted  into  law  in  1868?  If, as  Judge
McConnell  argues,  the  Privileges  or  Immunities  Clause  of that  Amendment
protects  some unenumerated  fundamental  rights,  exactly  what  such rights did
most Americans  have in  1868?  Put  another way,  what were the privileges  or
immunities that most Americans  had in  1868?  To shed light on this question,
we  decided  to look  at state  constitutional  law.  There  were  thirty-seven  states
in  1868  when  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  was  ratified  and  all  of them  pro-
tected  a  list  of  individual  rights  in  their  constitutions.  What  fundamental
rights were  among  those that  were  protected  under  state  constitutional  law  in
1868?  Did the  rights protected  include  all  of the  rights in  the  federal  Bill of
Rights  that  were  later  incorporated  to  apply  against  the  states?  What  about
the  four  rights  in  the  Bill  of Rights  that  have  not  been  incorporated?  Were
those  rights  protected  under  state  constitutional  law  in  1868?  Did any  states
in  1868  protect  a  right  to  privacy  or  to  bodily  autonomy  or  to  freedom  in
matters  of sexuality?

We  will not  seek  to  claim  here  that  the  question  of what  unenumerated
rights,  if  any,  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  protects  can  be  definitively  an-
swered  solely by  looking  at state  constitutional  law  in  1868,  but  we do  think
such  an  inquiry  can  help  shed  light  on  that  question.  There  are  clearly  a
number of fundamental  rights,  such  as the  liberty  of contract  and  the rights to
own  and  inherit  property,  that  were  protected  at  common  law  but  for  some
reason  never found their  way  into  state  constitutions.  So long  as  those rights
were  very deeply  rooted  in  our history  and tradition,  they may be  among  the
rights Justice  Bushrod  Washington  had  in  mind  when he  talked  about which

the  basic  values  that  underlie  our society."'  (quoting  Griswold  v.  Connecticut,  381  U.S.  479,  501

Two  of the  Constitution  in his  celebrated  but vacuous  opinion  in  Corfield v.
Coryell.14  
the  framers  of  the  Fourteenth
Amendment  even  if the  decision  seems to  offer little  guidance  to  us today.) 15
But  all  of that  is  a  subject  for  another  day.  What  we  seek  to  assert  here  is
that  if  one  assumes,  as  the  Court  did  in  Glucksberg, that  the  Fourteenth
Amendment  protects  only  those  rights that  are  deeply  rooted  in  history  and
tradition,  then one plausibly  good place to look for such  rights is in  state con-
stitutions  in  1868-the  year  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  was  ratified.  Such
an  inquiry  could even  be  said to  shed light on  the  original  public  meaning  of
the  Privileges  or  Immunities  Clause,  which  may  underpin  the  modem
doctrine  of substantive  due process. 16

The  Supreme  Court  in  recent years  has  frequently  done  nose  counts  or
tallies  of  state  law  to  determine 
the  evolving  meaning  of  the  Eighth
Amendment  prohibition  on  cruel  and  unusual  punishment.  Recently,  in
Roper  v.  Simmons, 17  the  Court  overruled 
in  Stanford  v.
Kentucky18  and found  the  death  penalty  for sixteen-  and seventeen-year-olds
to be  unconstitutional. 19  The  Court reached this  conclusion  in  2005  because
thirty  states  had  decided  to  outlaw  the  death  penalty  for juveniles 20  as  com-
pared  to  only  twenty-five  states  that  had  outlawed  that  penalty  in  1989.21
The  Court  also  recently  did  a  nose  count  of  states  in  Atkins  v.  Virginia,22
where  it  held  that  the  death  penalty  for  the  mentally  impaired  had  become
cruel  and  unusual  punishment.23  By  the  time  of the  Atkins  decision,  thirty

those  involving  "[p]rotection  by the  government,  the  enjoyment  of life  and  liberty....  the  right  to
acquire  and possess  property  of every  kind,  and to  pursue and  obtain happiness  and  safety;  subject
nevertheless  to  such  restraints  as  the  government  may justly  prescribe  for  the  general  good  of the
whole").

(1980)  ("[T]he  framers  of the  Fourteenth  Amendment adverted  repeatedly  to an  interpretation  given
its  Article  IV  counterpart  by  Justice  Washington,  sitting  alone  on  Circuit,  in  the  1823  case  of
Corfield v.  Coryell.").

16.  See  McConnell,  supra  note  1,  at  693-96  (exploring 

the  meaning  the  framers  of  the
Fourteenth  Amendment  intended  for  the  Privileges  or  Immunities  Clause  by  examining  court
doctrine  prevailing at  the time the  Amendment was written).

Amendment.").

maintained  it for adults  only.  Id. at 564.

21.  See  id. at  565.  Roper makes  it clear  that  thirty  states  had  eliminated  the  juvenile  death
penalty  by  2005,  and between  1989  and  2005,  five  additional  states  eliminated  the juvenile  death
penalty.  Id.; see also Stanford, 492  U.S.  at 370  (finding  that,  as of  1989,  thirteen  states  prohibited
the  death penalty entirely  and twelve  declined  to impose  it on anyone  under eighteen).

states  had  abolished  the  death  penalty  for  the  mentally  impaired.2 4   The
decision  overruled  the  Court's  1989  decision  in Penry v. Lynaugh,25  where  it
had upheld  the  death  penalty  for the mentally  impaired  because,  at that  time,
only  sixteen  states had outlawed  that penalty.26  The  Supreme  Court has  also
done  nose  counts  of states  in  holding  the  death  penalty  unconstitutional  for
rape 27 and  for felony  murder.28  Most  recently,  in  2008,  the  Court did  a  nose
count  of  states  in  Kennedy  v.  Louisiana29  to  support  its  determination  that
imposing  the death penalty  for child rape  is unconstitutional.3 °

In each  of the  above  cases,  the  Court analyzed  the  case  at hand as  if the
text  of  the  Eighth  Amendment-not  the  Fourteenth-was  at  issue,  even
though the  cases  all  arose  under the  Fourteenth  Amendment.  Using  a  nose
count  of  states  is  more  straightforward  under  the  words  of  the  Eighth
Amendment  because  the  text  of the  Cruel  and  Unusual  Punishment  Clause
arguably  calls  explicitly  for  a  nose  count  of states  by  requiring  an  inquiry
into  whether  a  punishment  has  become  "unusual." 
It  would  be  hard  to  an-
swer  that  question  without  doing  something  like  a  nose  count  of state  laws
unless  one  wanted  to  argue  that  only  punishments  that were unusual  in  1791
are  forbidden.  The  Fourteenth  Amendment  is  not  so  explicit.  Strikingly,
neither  of the  originalist  Justices  on  the  Supreme  Court  has  been  willing  to
rely  solely  on the original  meaning  of the words  cruel and unusual in Eighth
Amendment  cases.  They  have  both  followed  Chief Justice  Warren's  plural-
ity  opinion  in  Trop  v.  Dulles3 1  when  dissenting  from  recent  decisions

Focusing  on current state  constitutional  law to determine  what rights are
deeply rooted  in  our history  and tradition  as  a matter  of substantive  due  pro-
cess  would  obviously  be  mistaken.  That  being  said,  the  Court  did  take
account  of recent changes  in  state law when  it found a right to engage  in  sod-

Individual  Rights Under  State Constitutions  in  1868

having  been  wrongly  decided.34  But  a  nose  count  of  what  rights  were
protected  under  state  constitutions  in  1868  when  the Fourteenth  Amendment
was  adopted  would  arguably be  at  least  relevant  to  the  historical  question  of
what  rights are deeply rooted  in our history  and  tradition.  It could  be used to
shed  light  on  the  original  public  meaning  of  the  Privileges  or  Immunities

and  tradition  for  substantive-due-process  purposes-an  inquiry  that  the
Supreme  Court's  opinion  in  Washington v.  Glucksberg seems  to  call  for.
This  is  important  because  the  Supreme  Court  cites  Glucksberg approvingly
twice  in  Gonzales  v.  Carhart,35  which  is  its  most  recent  substantive-due-
process  decision.

We will make  no normative  claims  in this Article  about the  significance
for  federal  constitutional  law  today  of our tally  of state  constitutional  rights
in  1868.  Instead,  we intend  simply  to positively  describe  state  constitutional
law  at that  time.  Some  may  argue  that the  determination of what  fundamen-
tal  rights  are  protected  by  the  Privileges  or  Immunities  Clause  of  the
Fourteenth  Amendment  or  by  substantive  due  process  ought  not  to  be  ac-
complished  by  examining  state  constitutional  law  either  in  1868  or  today.
These  critics  might  say  either  that  it  is  up  to  the  Justices  of the  Supreme
Court to  say  what fundamental  rights the Fourteenth  Amendment  protects  or,
as  Bork  claims,  that  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  protects  only  the  rights  in
the  Bill of Rights and nothing more.

Assume  for  a  moment,  for the  sake  of argument,  that  the  Privileges  or
Immunities  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  protects  unenumerated
rights  that  are  fundamental,  but that  those  rights can  be  overcome  by  a  rea-
sonable  exercise  of the  police  power,  as  Justice  Washington's  opinion  in
Corfield explicitly  says.37  Would  not an  examination  of state  constitutional
law  in  1868  give  you  a  rough  picture  of what  individual  rights  people  had
such that exercise  of the police  power  to overcome  them  would be  unreason-
able?  We  think  it would.  The  Corfield opinion  clearly  implies  that there  are

Justice  of the  Supreme  Court, he would  have  been the

first  to  read  liberty  as  though  it were  exhausted  by  the  rights  the  majority  expressly
conceded  individuals  in  the Bill  of Rights.  He  would be  the first  to reject  an  evolving

unenumerated  individual  rights that  are deeply  rooted in history  and  tradition
and  constitutionally  protected,  but  that  can be  overcome  by  general  laws  en-
acted  for  the  good  of the  whole  people.  Transposed  to  the  Fourteenth
Amendment,  this  analysis  could be  understood to  ask the  Justices  to  do  what
they  did  in  Lochner  v.  New  York 38  and  separate  out  reasonable  from
unreasonable  exercises  of the  police  power.39  What  better  way  to  figure  out
which  exercises  of  the  police  power 
the  framers  of  the  Fourteenth
Amendment  would  have  thought  were  reasonable  or  unreasonable  at  the
constitutional  level  than  by  looking  at  state  constitutions  in  1868? 
If  the
Fourteenth  Amendment  commands  that  state  laws  be  reasonable  as  Lochner
said-and that  is  a very big  if-why  not look  for the  answer  to  that  question
in  state  constitutions  in  1868?  Surely that  is  more  principled  than  the  alter-
natives  of either  deferring  to  any  state  law  so  long  as  it is  barely  rational  or
giving  the  elite,  life-tenured  Justices  of the  Supreme  Court  the  power  to
create  new individual  fundamental  rights.

But  whatever  one  concludes  normatively,  it  is  surely  clear  that  a
summary  of individual  rights  under state  constitutional  law  in  1868  is at least
interesting  as  a  matter  of our constitutional  history.  That is  the  premise that
underlies  our Article,  and  it is  for that  reason  that  we  present  here  a tally  of
what  individual  rights  were  protected-and  to  what  degree-under  state
constitutions  in  1868.

We  placed  the  protected  rights  in  five  categories.  The  first  category
consists  of those  individual  rights  that were  recognized  by  three-quarters  or
more  of the  states  in  1868.  These  rights  would  seem to  be  especially  deeply
rooted  in  history  and  tradition  because  three-quarters  is the  number  of states
that  Article  V  sets  as  the  threshold  consensus  necessary  for  the  making  of
federal constitutional  law.  The  "rule  of recognition"  under Article  V  is two-
thirds  of  both  houses  of  Congress  and  three-quarters  of  the  states.4 °
Arguably,  rights  protected  by  less  than  three-quarters  of the  states  in  1868
were  not  believed to  be  fundamental  and are  not deeply  rooted in  history and
tradition.  Some,  however,  will  undoubtedly  feel  that  a  consensus  of three-
quarters  of the  states  in  1868  sets  the bar  way  too  high,  so  we  also  look  at
four  lesser  degrees  of consensus.  Accordingly,  we  also  asked  how  many  in-
dividual  rights  were  protected  by  two-thirds  of the  states;  how  many  were
recognized  by  a simple  majority;  how many  were  recognized  by  one-quarter
or  more;  and  finally,  how  many  rights  were  recognized  by  less  than  one-
quarter  of the  states  in  1868.  In  so  doing,  we  hope  to  present  our data  in  a

form  that will  allow others  to  more  readily  make  whatever  normative  claims
they want to  make  about the  significance of our findings.

In  addition  to  determining  what  rights  were  protected  by  which  state
constitutions  in  1868,  we  have  also  asked  what  percentage  of the  American
people at that  time  lived  in  states  that  protected  each  specific  right.  In  other
words, for  example,  if right X was  protected  by three-quarters  of the  states  in
1868,  we  have  determined  what  percentage  of Americans  living  in  1868
lived in the  states  where right X was  protected.  This number  obviously  could
be higher  or  lower than  75%  of the  national  population  at that  time.  Article
V  of the  federal  Constitution  requires  a  consensus  of  two-thirds  of  both
houses  of Congress  in  addition  to three-quarters  of the  states  to make  federal
constitutional  law.  The  requirement  that  two-thirds  of the  popularly  elected
House  of Representatives  concur  before  federal  constitutional  law  can  be
made  reflects  the  idea  that  no  new  constitutional  law  ought  ever to  be  fash-
the  population  as  well  as
ioned  without  supermajority  support  among 
supermajority  support  among  the  states.  By  looking  at populations  living  in
states  where  certain  rights  are protected,  we  allow  future  authors  to  take  ac-
count of this concern.

Third,  we  have  looked  at three  major regions  of the  United  States-the
Northeast,  the  South,  and the  Midwest-West-to  see  if certain  rights  were
more  widely  recognized  in  one region  or another  in  1868.41  Finally,  we have
grouped  state  constitutions  into  constitutions  that  were  older  in  1868  (i.e.,
those  that  were  promulgated  before  1855)  and  those  that  were  more  recent
(i.e.,  those  that  went  into  effect  after  1855).  Arguably  a  right  that  was  only
thirteen  years  old  in  1868  might  not  yet  have  been  viewed  as  fundamental.
Charting  the rise  and fall of references  to rights over  time  may  be relevant  to
the  question  of what  rights the  Supreme Court ought to  recognize  today.  We
picked  1855  as  the  dividing  line between  old  and new  state  constitutions  be-
cause  half of  the  thirty-seven  state  constitutions  were  ratified  before  1855,
and half of them were  ratified  after  1855.  This  symmetry  allowed us to  more
easily compare trends.

Supreme  Court  Justices  diverge  on  the  question  of how  to  determine
what  rights  are  fundamental  for  substantive-due-process  purposes,  but  the
prevalence  of rights  in  state  constitutional  law  over  time  could,  at  least  in
theory,  provide  a  rough  benchmark  of  how  deeply  rooted  a  right  is.  The
rights  in  the  federal  Constitution  closely  track  those  in  state  constitutions,

41.  We grouped  the  Midwestern  and Western  states together  in  our analysis  because  there  were
only  three  Western states  in  1868:  California,  Nevada,  and Oregon.  Our  initial  calculations  for  the
West,  which was  analyzed  separately  from  the  Midwest,  were  not terribly  probative  because  of the
In  other  words,  the  fact  that  there  were  only  three  states  made  it  difficult  to

generalize  about "the  West"  in  a meaningful  way.  Combining  the  Midwestern  and  Western  states
provides  the benefit  of more  valid  generalizations  about  trends in  constitutional  rights at  the  cost  of
potentially  losing  some  interesting  information  about  actual  variations  between  these  two  regions.
Separate  data  on  the  West  and Midwest  were  retained  by  the  authors  and  can  be  made  available

and  many  Americans  have  lived  for  centuries  with  these  rights  and  come  to
regard them  as  enduring  guarantees.  There  are  those who  think  that  the  law
is  what  it  has  been  in  practice  over  a  long  period  of time.42  One  may  dis-
agree  with  that  Burkean  view,  but  it  must  surely  be  the  case  that  a  right  or
practice  that  was  widespread  140  years  ago  and  that  remains  enshrined  in
Supreme  Court  Fourteenth  Amendment  case  law  today  is  an unlikely  candi-
date to be  struck down anytime  soon.  Rights,  such as  freedom  of speech, that
were  protected  by  all  thirty-seven  state  constitutions  in  1868-and  are  still
protected  today-would  seem  to  us  to  be  at  least  plausible  candidates  for
protection  as fundamental  rights under the  Fourteenth Amendment.

This  Article then provides  a list of all  of the  individual  rights (and a  few
of the  structural  limits  on  government  enacted  for  the  particular  benefit  of
individuals)  that  were  enumerated  in  the  thirty-seven  individual  state  consti-
tutions  in  place  in  1868. 
In  total,  an  astonishing  102  different  rights  were
guaranteed  by  the  states  at  that  time.  Uncovering  and  categorizing  these
rights allows  a fascinating  picture  of American  liberties  to  emerge.  Both the
unanticipated  degree  of consensus  and the telling  divergences  between  states
provide  fodder  for modern  debates  as  to  the  scope  of fundamental  constitu-
tional rights.  We think this information  is potentially useful  in understanding
substantive  due  process,  in predicting  the  fate  of the  few remaining  incorpo-
ration questions  (because  incorporation  has  occurred  through  substantive  due
process43), in refraining  our thinking  about clauses  assumed to  be purely con-
cerned  with  federalism,44  or  simply  in  more  vividly  depicting  American
citizenship  in  1868  and  shedding  light on  American  legal  history.  Our  core
aim,  however,  is  to  provide  a  descriptive  account  of what  the  evidence  here
shows  and not to  make  any normative  claims as to what the  evidence  implies.
That is  a question we will  leave for  another day.

Individual  Rights Under  State Constitutions  in  1868

by  providing  a  detailed  account  of the  method  used  to  generate  the  results
reported  below.  This  method involved  three  steps:  collecting,  counting,  and
categorizing.

A.  Collection

The  first  step was  to obtain  copies  of the  thirty-seven  state  constitutions
that were in effect in  1868,  the year the Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the United
States  Constitution  was  ratified  and declared  to  be  part  of the  Constitution.
We  chose  to  look  at the  state  constitutions  that  were  closest  in time  to  1868
without  being  later.  For example,  if a  state passed  constitutions  in  1860  and
1870,  we  used  the  1860  constitution  for our analysis  even  though  1870  was
closer  in  time  to  1868.  The  reason  is  that  we  wanted  to  understand  what
rights the  people  of each  state  were legally  entitled to  as a matter  of positive
state  law at the time  the Fourteenth  Amendment  was  drafted and enacted.45

Next  we  both  separately  and  jointly  examined  each  state  constitution
closely,  and  we  then  coded  each  right  or  clause  denying  a  right 46  into  a
comprehensive  database.  We recorded  the data by state,  by the year in which
the  constitution  was  adopted,  and by  the  location  of the  right or  denial  of a
right within  the  constitution,  and  we  included  the  entire  positive-law  consti-
tutional  text  that  recognized  the  right  or  denied  the  right  in  question.  The
data  were  then  grouped  by  individual,  state  constitutional  rights,  so  that
similar  rights from the  thirty-seven  states that  were members  of the  Union  in
1868  could be  grouped  together.  The  authors  then  thoroughly  reviewed  the
complete  database  to ensure  its accuracy.47

B.  Counting

We  then  counted  the  number  of  state  constitutions  that  textually
enumerated  each  individual  right  or  denial  of a  right.  We  calculated  the
number  of  states,  out  of  thirty-seven,  needed  to  constitute,  respectively,

45.  This  sometimes  led  to  the  use  of  constitutions  that  were  ratified  much  earlier  than  the
others.  See, e.g.,  CONN.  CONST.  of  1818.  Despite  potential  differences  that are  a  direct  function  of
being  ratified  in different  eras,  we  felt  that it was  important  not to use  constitutions  that were  not in
place  in  1868.  However,  to  draw  out  these  potential  differences,  part  of  our  analysis  involved
comparing the  newer  constitutions  with the  older  ones.

46.  In  addition  to  individual  rights,  we  also  coded  clauses  that  contained  relevant  structural
limitations  (e.g.,  requirements  that  state  governments  act  only  consistently  with  the  separation  of
powers,  and  Ninth  Amendment  analogs)  where  those  structural  limitations  were  most  obviously
designed  to protect  individual  rights.  We  also  noted the  absence  of, for  example,  a right to  gamble
or  to duel,  reflected  by  constitutional  clauses  that banned  lotteries  or dueling.  Finally, we  counted
specific  constitutional  acknowledgments  of rights,  such  as  the  right  to  bring  a  libel  suit,  that  the
Supreme  Court has  found  in modem times  to be  constrained  by  the  First Amendment.  N.Y.  Times
Co.  v.  Sullivan,  376  U.S.  254,  278-79  (1964).  Our  coding  thus  takes  account  not  only  of rights
recognized  under  positive  state  constitutional  law  in  1868  but  also  of rights  that  might have  been
recognized but were  not.

[Vol.  87:7

three-quarters  of the  thirty-seven  states  in  the  Union  in  1868,  two-thirds  of
those  states,  a  majority  of those  states,  one-quarter  of those  states,  and  less
than  one-quarter  of those  states.  We  then  grouped  the  rights  into  each  of
these  five  categories.  The  idea underlying  this  nose count  of states  was  that
the  larger  the  number of states  that  recognized  a  right,  the  more  likely  it was
that  the  right  was  considered  to  be  fundamental  in  1868  and  thus  that  it  is
deeply rooted  in  our history  and tradition.  Because  of the  enormous  amount
of data  involved,  we  looked  only at  rights textually  enumerated  in  state  con-
stitutions  and  not  at  state  court  opinions  construing  those  clauses.  That
project would be a  valuable,  if not essential, one  to undertake  in the  future.

We  also  created  other  groupings  to  shed  light  on the  question  of what
rights  were  deemed  to be  fundamental  in  1868  such  that they might  today  be
considered  to  be  deeply  rooted  in  our history  and  tradition.  Thus,  as  men-
tioned  above,  we  calculated  what  percentage  of the  total  U.S.  population  at
the  time  lived  in  states  where  the  particular constitutional  guarantee  in ques-
tion  was  recognized.48  We  also  sorted  the  rights  according  to  geographic
region-Northeast,  South,  and  Midwest-West. 49   We  wanted  to  know,  for
example,  whether  gun  rights  were  recognized  more  widely  in  some  geo-
graphic  regions  in  1868  than  in  others.  This  might  go  to  the  question  of
whether there  was a broad federal  consensus  recognizing  a particular right.

Finally,  as  mentioned  above,  we  sorted  the  rights  by  date  of enactment
of the relevant  state constitution  to  figure out which  state  constitutional rights
were relatively  "new"  in  1868  and which  were  "old."  This  allowed  us to de-
termine  whether  each  right  became  more  or  less  pervasive  in  the  years
leading up  to  1868.  It  seemed important  to us to separate  out those state  con-
stitutional  rights that  were relatively  new  in  1868  from those  that dated  back
to  the  founding  of the  republic.  Arguably,  a  constitutional  right  that  three-
quarters  of the  states  recognized  in  1868  might  not have  been deemed  to  be

48.  This  was  done  by  obtaining  a  population  census  from  1870  for  each  state  and  multiplying
the  states  in  which  each  right  was  guaranteed  by  their  respective  populations. 
In  1870,  there  were
38,115,641  people  in  the  United  States.  The  breakdown  of population  by  state  was  as  follows:
Alabama,  996,992;  Arkansas,  484,471;  California,  560,247;  Connecticut,  537,454;  Delaware,

Individual  Rights Under  State Constitutions  in  1868

fundamental  if the  only  state  constitutions  recognizing  that  right  were  merely
thirteen  years  old  at the time.  Alternatively,  one  could argue  that a  right  that
was  recognized  by a  consistently increasing  number of states  is  more  deeply
rooted than a right that became  less pervasive  over time.5 °

C.  Categorizing

We found  a  very  large  number  of individual  positive-law  rights  under
state constitutional  law  in  1868.  Because we  found  so  many rights that  were
recognized,  we  thought  it  necessary  to group  the  rights  into  substantive  cate-
gories  for  purposes  of presenting  our  results  below.  We  ended  up  grouping
the  rights in  question into  the  following  sixteen  categories:  (1) rights  involv-
ing  religion,  including  establishment-clause  and  free-exercise-clause  rights;
(2)  rights  of political  participation,  including  freedom  of the  press,  freedom
of speech,  and rights to  assemble,  associate,  and petition;  (3) rights involving
access  to  guns  or  bearing  in  some  way  on  the  military,  such  as  rights  con-
ferred  by  forbidding  the  quartering  of  soldiers  in  private  homes  or  by
banning  standing  armies;  (4)  individual  rights  to a particular  kind  of govern-
ment  structure,  such  as  a  guarantee  that  no official  shall  exercise  at the  same
time  legislative,  executive,  and judicial  powers;  (5) rights  analogous  to  those
protected  by Article  I, Section Ten  of the  federal  Constitution,  such  as  rights
to  be  free  from  ex  post  facto  laws,  bills  of attainder,  or  laws  impairing  the
obligation  of contracts;  (6)  rights  analogous  to  those  in  the  federal  Fourth
Amendment  protecting,  for  example,  against  unreasonable  searches  and
seizures; 
to.  the  various  other  criminal-procedure
guarantees  of the  federal  Bill  of Rights;  (8)  rights  analogous  to  the  federal
Eighth  Amendment  prohibitions  on  excessive  fines,  bail,  and  the  imposition
of cruel  and  unusual  punishments;  (9)  rights to jury  trials  in criminal  or  civil
cases  and  to grand juries  for indictment;  (10)  clauses protecting  rights  to  pri-
vate  property  in  any  way;  (11)  rights  akin  to  what  we  know  today  as  equal
protection  of the  laws;  (12)  rights to  not be  deprived  of life,  liberty,  or prop-
erty  without  due  process  of law;  (13)  rights  to  travel  either  into  or  out  of a
particular  state;  (14)  rights  to  an  education  in  a  public  school  or  to  other
forms  of positive  government  assistance  or  welfare  that  were  implied  by the
imposition  of  an  obligatory  duty  on  the  state  to  provide  the  benefit  in
question;  (15)  clauses  discussing  what were  regarded  in  1868  as  prohibitable
vices;  and finally,  and  most  tellingly,  (16)  arguable  recognitions  in  positive
state constitutional  law in  1868 of natural law  as a source  of rights.

(7)  rights  analogous 

These  groupings  are  intended  to  make  the  information  presented
below  more  accessible,  and  we  do  not  mean  to  suggest  or  imply  any
normative  arguments  for the  underlying  importance  or meaning  of the rights
by  the  categorizations  we  have  used  here.  We  recognize  that  many  of the

States  that  is  significant,  but  the  consistency  of  the  direction  of  change."'  (quoting  Atkins  v.
Virginia,  536 U.S.  304,  315 (2002))).

Texas  Law Review

[Vol.  87:7

rights  we  discuss  here  could  easily be argued  to  fall  into several  of the  cate-
gories,  or  even  into  new  categories,  depending  on  the  interests  and  the
understanding  of the  reader.  Here, then,  are our findings.

III.  The  Data on State  Constitutional  Rights  in  1868

The  sixteen  different  categories 

in  which  we  found  individual,
positive-law  state  constitutional  rights  appear  below.  For  each  right,  we
discuss:  (1) how  many states  recognized  the  right;  (2)  what  proportion  of the
total  population lived in states recognizing  the right;  (3) regional  variations  in
the  recognition  of the  right;  and (4)  which  rights  were  relatively new  in  1868
and which  were  older  and more  established.  For each  right,  where  possible,
we  try  to  provide  sample  language  typically  used to  describe  or declare  the
right.  For each  right,  there  is a corresponding  appendix  that  contains  the full
text  of each  constitution's  relevant  clause  granting  that  right. 51  These  are
grouped loosely  according  to the  sixteen topics they  address.

The  following  graphs  summarize  some  of  our  most  important  or

striking findings.

51.  The  full  appendix  is on  file  with  the  authors  and  with  the  Texas  Law  Review.  See supra

Individual  Rights Under  State  Constitutions  in  1868

A.  Rights Bearing on Religion

The  first  of our  sixteen  categories  of fights  found  in  the  thirty-seven
state  constitutions  in  1868  are  rights  bearing  on the  subject  of religion.  This
is  appropriate  because  the  religion  clauses  of the  federal  First  Amendment
are  the first  rights to  appear in the  federal  Bill of Rights.52  Religious  freedom
had  been  a  central  issue  in the  English  Glorious  Revolution  of  1688,13  and  it
was  of  central  concern  to  the  framers  and  ratifiers  of  the  federal  Bill  of
Rights  as well.54  It occupied  a  similarly  exalted  status  in  state  bills of fights
in  1868.  The  Free  Exercise  Clause  was  first applied to  the  states  through its
incorporation  into the  Fourteenth  Amendment  as  a matter  of substantive  due
process  in  Cantwell v.  Connecticut in  1940.55  The  Establishment  Clause  was
first  incorporated  and  applied  to  the  states  as  a  matter  of substantive  due
process  in Everson v. Board of Education in  1947.56  However,  we  found that
most  states  already  included  analogs  to  both  clauses  in  their  state  constitu-
tions  well  before  the  Supreme  Court  incorporated  them.57  Such  widespread
replication  of First Amendment  rights at the state  level in  1868 might  suggest
that  the  rights  embodied  in  the  First  Amendment  are  fundamental.  The
question  of their  scope  and  meaning,  in both  state  constitutions  and our  fed-
eral  Constitution,  is still largely up  for debate.58

1.  Establishment Clause Analogs.-Twenty-seven  states-or two-thirds
of the  thirty-seven  states  that formed  the  United  States  in  1868-had  clauses
in their  constitutions  that, in  our view,  explicitly prohibited  the  establishment

52.  The  First  Amendment  of the  Bill  of Rights  was  actually  the  third  of twelve  amendments
proposed  by  Congress.  See AMAR,  supra note  44,  at  20  ("The  First  Congress's  first  two  proposed
amendments  offer an  illuminating  perspective  on  its  Third  (our First)  Amendment.").  The  first two
were  not ratified  in  1791  but the last ten were.  Id. at 8.  Those  ten  amendments  then became  the Bill
of Rights.  One  of the  two  unratified  amendments  was  subsequently  ratified  in  1992  and  became  the
It  could  thus  be  argued  that  the
Twenty-Seventh  Amendment  of  the  Constitution. 
Congress  that proposed  the  Bill  of Rights  did not  intend religious  rights  to come  first.  Of course,  it
can  be  equally  well  maintained  that  the  ratifiers  of the  Bill  of Rights  disagreed,  and  that  they
determined  that religious  rights would  come  first.  In  any event,  for  whatever  reason, it is  a  fact that
the  Bill  of Rights, which Americans  have  venerated  for two  centuries,  begins  with rights  bearing  on
religious  freedom.

of  a  state 
Typical  establishment  clauses  provided,  "No
subordination  nor preference  of any  one sect  or denomination  to another  shall
ever be  established  by  law."59  Some  clauses  were  less  explicit,  prohibiting
establishment  by  preventing  the  government  from  forcing  citizens  to  finan-
cially  support any  specific religion.6 °

There  was  thus  a broad  consensus  in  1868  in  favor  of nonestablish-
ment  in state  constitutional  law,  but  the  consensus  fell  one  state  short  of the
three-quarters  consensus  required  by  Article  V of the  federal  Constitution  to
make federal  constitutional  law.  It  is striking that  so many  states in  1868 had
clauses  in  their  state  constitutions  prohibiting  the  establishment  of religion
and  implying  that  freedom  from  an  establishment  was  an  individual  funda-
mental  right  and  not  a collective-federalism  state  right  against  the  national
government.  This  evidence  strongly  supports  Professor  Kurt  Lash's  argu-
ment  that  even  if the  federal  Establishment  Clause  in  1791  was  originally
meant as  a federalism  device  to  protect against  established  state  churches,  by
1868  the  ratifiers  of the  Fourteenth  Amendment  would  have  thought  that
freedom  from  a religious  establishment  was  an  individual  fundamental  right
or  privilege  or  immunity.6'  If so,  Justice  Clarence  Thomas's  argument  that
the Establishment  Clause  ought never  to have been  incorporated  may turn  out
to  be  wrong,  because  by  1868  most Americans  thought  of nonestablishment
as  a  matter  of  individual  rights  and  not  federalism. 62   Most  Americans  in
1868  would  have  thought  that  their privileges  or  immunities  included  an  in-
dividual right to be  free from a religious  establishment.

Looking  at the  right to  be  free  from a religious  establishment  in  terms
of what  percentage  of the  population  lived  in  states  that  forbade  religious
establishments,  we  found  that  a  staggering  71%  of the  population  lived  in
such  states-an  overwhelming  supermajority.  This  seems  like  compelling
evidence  in  support  of a  Fourteenth  Amendment  rule  of state  nonestablish-
ment as a matter of individual  right.

59.  E.g.,  ME.  CONST.  of 1819,  art.  I, § 3.
60.  E.g.,  MICH.  CONST.  of 1850,  art. IV,  § 39  ("The  legislature  shall pass no  law  to... compel
any  person  to attend, erect, or  support any place  of religious  worship, or  to pay  tithes,  taxes,  or other
rates  for the support  of any minister of the gospel  or teacher  of religion.").

61.  See  Kurt  T. Lash,  The  Second Adoption  of the Establishment  Clause: The  Rise  of the
Nonestablishment Principle, 27  ARIz.  ST.  L.J.  1085,  1099-1100  (1995)  (asserting  that  if, by  1868,
"the  words  of  the  Establishment  Clause  had  been  reinterpreted  to  express  the  principle  that  no
person  should  be  subject to  state-imposed  religious  establishments,"  then "it  would  not have  been
illogical  for the  framers  of the  Fourteenth Amendment  to expect  its incorporation").

62.  See Zelman  v. Simmons-Harris,  536 U.S.  639,  678  (2002) (Thomas,  J.,  concurring).  Justice
Thomas  wrote  that the  provision does  not on  its face  limit  states  with regard  to religion.  Id. Rather,
he  argued,  "The  Establishment  Clause  originally  protected  States,  and  by  extension  their  citizens,
from  the  imposition  of an  established  religion by  the  Federal  Government.  Whether  and  how  this
Clause should  constrain  state  action  under the  Fourteenth  Amendment  is a more  difficult  question."
Id. (citation  omitted);  see  also  Elk  Grove  Unified  Sch.  Dist.  v.  Newdow,  542  U.S.  1, 45  (2004)
(Thomas,  J.,  concurring)  ("I  would  acknowledge  that  the  Establishment  Clause  is  a  federalism
provision,  which, for this reason,  resists incorporation.").

Individual  Rights Under  State  Constitutions  in  1868

in 

regional  variation 

There  was  substantial 

the  prevalence  of
establishment  clauses.  Establishment  of religion  was  prohibited  in  83%  of
Midwestern-Western  state  constitutions,  in  70%  of Northeastern  state  con-
stitutions,  and in  67%  of Southern  state  constitutions.  Finally,  establishment
clauses  were  found  in  78%  of the  pre-1855  constitutions  and  68%  of  the
post-1855  constitutions.  This  is  surprising  in  light  of  other  evidence  that
Americans  after the  Civil  War were more  religious  than they had been  in  the
early  years  of our constitutional  republic.63  Interestingly,  two  states  in  1868,
Massachusetts  and New  Hampshire,  not  only  permitted  the  establishment  of
a  religion  but  explicitly  established  Christianity 64  and  Protestantism,65
respectively.  Connecticut  did  a  little  bit  of both,  in  one  clause  prohibiting
establishment  by  banning  compelled  support  or  association  with  any
church,66  and in another  establishing,  or at least  providing  special recognition
of, Christianity.67  Ten  states  in  1868  thus  either  did not  have  establishment
clauses  or, in two  cases,  still explicitly established  a state religion.

2.  Free Exercise.-The Free  Exercise  Clause  was  first  applied  to  the
states through  Fourteenth Amendment  substantive  due  process  in  Cantwell v.
Connecticut in  1940.68  However,  all  thirty-seven  state  constitutions  in  1868
already  guaranteed  the  right  to  the  free  exercise  of one's religion,  albeit  in
words  that  were  arguably  somewhat  more  watered-down  than  the  words  of
the  federal  Free  Exercise  Clause.  A typical  state  constitutional  free  exercise
clause  read,  "That  no  person  shall  be  deprived  of the  right  to  worship  God
according  to the  dictates  of his own conscience.', 69

thirty-seven 

contained
extremely  interesting  variations  in  their  wording  that  are  worth  further
categorization  and  analysis.  Our  federal  Constitution  guarantees  the  free
"exercise"  of religion, 70  but  the  vast  majority  of state  constitutions  in  1868

15-16  (1992)  (finding  the  rate  of religious  adherence  in  America  to be  17%  before  the  American

include  the  ability  of Native  Americans  to  ingest  peyote  during  religious
rituals, 75 but  it  would  not  necessarily  protect  Amish  parents  from  having  to
send their children to  school 76 or protect a  church  from a historic preservation
law. 77   Specifically,  thirty-five  states  in  1868-more  than  a  three-quarters,
Article  V consensus-had  freedom-of-worship clauses,  but  only  three  states
had free  exercise clauses,  with one  state,  Maryland,  having both.  The differ-
ences  between  these  various  wordings  of religious-rights  clauses  could  have
significant  ramifications  for religious  rights.  For example,  the  predominant
freedom-of-worship  clauses  may  not  protect  religiously  motivated  actions

dictionary  offers  the  following  definitions  that  may  shed  light  on  the  original  meaning  of the  word
worship.  Worship is  defined  as  "[t]o  perform  acts  of adoration,  [t]o  perform  religious  services."
The  example  given  is  from  John  4:20:  "Our  fathers  worshipped  in  this  mountain."  NOAH
WEBSTER,  AN  AMERICAN  DICTIONARY  OF  THE  ENGLISH  LANGUAGE  (1828).  The  word  worship
derives  from  the  noun  wurrshipe,  which  in  1200  meant  "condition  of being  worthy,  distinction,
honor" with "[t]he  meaning  of respect or  honor shown  to a person  or thing..,  first  recorded  in  Old
English (about  1000)  and  that of reverence  or  veneration  paid to a being  regarded as supernatural  or

Individual  Rights Under  State Constitutions  in  1868

Division  v.  Smith78  may  be  more  on  the  mark  than  Judge  McConnell's
reading  of that right in McConnell's  scholarship. 9

It  is  very  interesting  in  light  of the  Scalia-McConnell  debate  that  five
state  constitutions  in  1868  also  specifically  prohibited  the  diminishing  or
enlarging  of individual  rights  based  on  a  person's  religion.  These  clauses
were  generally  written  as  follows:  "That  the  civil  rights,  privileges,  or  ca-
pacities  of any  citizen  shall  in no wise  be  diminished  or  enlarged  on account
of his  religion., 80   These  clauses  could  be  read  to  render  laws  such  as  the
Religious  Freedom  Restoration  Act 8 l  (RFRA)  unconstitutional  because  such
laws  enlarge rights and privileges  on account  of religion.  Another  interesting
finding  among  the  state  free  exercise  clauses  is  that  fifteen  states,  or  41%,
contained  explicit public-peace-and-safety  exceptions  to  free  exercise  rights.
A  typical  such  exception  stated,  "[T]he  liberty  of conscience  hereby  secured
shall  not be  so  construed  as  to  excuse  acts  of licentiousness,  or justify  prac-
tices  inconsistent  with  the  peace  or  safety  of  this  state." 82  This  too  lends
support to  Justice  Scalia's position in Smith.

Many free  exercise  clauses contained  language that to  modem ears  seems
incongruous  because  it  emphasizes  the  importance  of religion  over  nonre-
ligion;  the  free  exercise  of atheism  was  certainly  not  contemplated  by  the
majority  of these  states.  Delaware,  for instance,  protected  the  free  exercise
of religion  "[a]lthough  it  is  the  duty  of all  men  frequently  to  assemble  to-
gether  for  the  public  worship  of the  Author  of the  universe,  and piety  and
morality,  on  which  the  prosperity  of  communities  depends,  are  thereby
promoted.",83   This  decision  not  to  protect  agnosticism  or  atheism  as  a
permissible  "religious"  choice  is  striking  given  modem  debates  about  the
religion clauses.84  The  point is  emphasized  by references  to  God  in  many  of

78.  494 U.S.  872  (1990).
79.  Compare id.  at  878  (holding  that  the  First  Amendment  does  not  justify  violation  of  a
generally  applicable  law,  so  long  as  the  prohibition  of religious  exercise  is  merely  "incidental"
rather  than  the  object  of the  law),  with  Michael  W.  McConnell,  The  Problem  of Singling Out
Religion, 50  DEPAUL  L.  REV.  1,  45-47  (2000)  (urging  an  extension  of the  free  exercise  doctrine,

84.  To  date,  the  Supreme  Court  has  avoided  formulating  a  definition  of "religion"  under  the
First Amendment.  It  has,  however,  been  more  definitive  in  cases  involving  statutory  construction.
Specifically,  the  Court  has  construed  the  "religious  training  and  belief'  requirement  for  the  draft
exemption  under  the  Universal  Military  Training  and  Selective  Service  Act to  include  nontheistic
reasons  for  conscientious  objection.  See  Welsh  v.  United  States,  398  U.S.  333,  342-43  (1970)
(reasoning  that  the  "religious  training  and  belief'  draft  exemption  is  not  open  to  those  "whose
beliefs  are  not  deeply held"  or "whose  objection  to  war does  not rest  at  all  upon  moral,  ethical,  or
instead  rests  solely  upon  considerations  of  policy,  pragmatism,  or

the  state  constitutions  as  the  "author  of all  good  government" 85  or  as  the
"great  Legislator  of the universe. ,86  These  references  conflate  the  existence
of ordered  liberty  with  a  constitutional  acknowledgment  of the  existence  of
God, suggesting  that  the  construction  of an  ordered  state  requires  a  constitu-
tional  repudiation  of atheism.  Under  such  a  view, references  to  "under  God"
in  the  Pledge  of Allegiance  or to  "In  God  We Trust"  on our currency  would
be  entirely unproblematic.

3.  Religious  Qualifications for  Holding Office.-The  original  federal
Constitution,  even  before  the  adoption  of  the  First  Amendment,  banned
religious  qualifications  for holding  federal  office. 87  It  is  thus  not  surprising
that  a  substantial  number  of  states  also  banned  such  qualifications  in  their
constitutions  in  1868. 
In  all,  twenty-four  states-a  majority  of  the  thirty-
seven-prohibited  religious  tests  as  qualifications  for  holding  public  office.
The  clauses  in  question generally  provided,  "[N]o  religious  test  shall  ever be
required  as a qualification  to  any  office  of public trust  under this  State." 88  It
is perhaps  surprising  that  more  states-two-thirds  or  three-quarters-did  not
ban  religious  qualifications  for  holding  office.  Looking  at  the  issue  by
population,  it turns out that  66%  of Americans living  in  1868-roughly  two-
thirds-lived  in jurisdictions  where  religious  qualifications  for holding  office
were  forbidden.  This prohibition  was  found  in 75%  of Midwestern-Western
states, 67%  of Southern states,  and 50%  of Northeastern  states.  Seventy-four
percent  of the  post-1855  constitutions,  compared  to  56%  of the  pre-1855
constitutions,  prohibited  religious  qualifications.  This  suggests  a  modest
trend  toward  forbidding  religious  qualifications  for  holding  office.  Interest-
ingly, 
religious
qualifications  for holding  office  but  allowed  the  disqualification  from  office
of atheists. 89  One  state  constitution  in  1868,  that of New  Hampshire,  explic-
itly created  a religious  (and property)  test  for qualification  for public  office. 90
Furthermore,  seven  of the  original  state  constitutions  called  for the  disquali-
fication  of ministers  from  legislative  office-a  practice  that  was  declared

4.  Specific  References  to  God  in  the  Preambles of  the  1868  State
Constitutions.-There  is  one 
state
constitutions  in  1868  explicitly  differed  from  the  federal  Constitution  and
Bill  of Rights  on a  matter bearing  on religion.  Fully  twenty-seven,  or two-
thirds, of the  1868  state  constitutions  contained  an  explicit  reference  to  God
in  their preambles.  A typical  such  reference  stated, "[W]e,  the people  of the
State  of Indiana, grateful  to Almighty  God for  the  free exercise  of the right to
choose  our  own  form  of government,  do  ordain  this  constitution.'93 Some
might argue  that these references,  like  other references  to  God,  seem again  to
legitimize the  use of phrases  such  as  "under God"  in the Pledge  of Allegiance
or "In  God  We  Trust"  on the  currency.  They  explicitly and  textually  specify
the  existence  of God  in  the  constitutional  text  itself.  The  counterargument
might  be  that  we  have  many  more  polytheists,  atheists,  and  agnostics  today
than were  present  in  1868.  As Justice  Brennan observed:

[O]ur  religious  composition  makes  us  a  vastly  more  diverse  people
than  were  our  forefathers.  They  knew  differences  chiefly  among
Protestant  sects. 
is  far  more  heterogeneous
religiously,  including  as  it  does  substantial  minorities  not  only  of
Catholics  and Jews  but as  well  of those  who  worship  according  to  no
version  of the Bible  and those  who  worship no God  at all.94

Today  the  nation 

Obviously,  the  federal  Constitution  and  Bill  of Rights  make  no  reference  to
God in the text  whatsoever.

Looking  at  this  matter  by  population,  it  turns  out  that  73%  of  the
American  people  in  1868  lived  in  states  that  had constitutions  that  explicitly
mentioned  God.  Sorting  these  clauses  by  region,  we  find  that  83%  of
Midwestern-Western  constitutions 
to  God,  as  did  70%  of
Northeastern  state  constitutions  and  67%  of  Southern  state  constitutions.
These explicit  textual  references  to God  appeared in  67%  of the pre-1855  and
in  79%  of  the  post-1855  constitutions.  This  increasing  prevalence  is  sur-
prising  given  the  absolute  absence  of  references 
to  God  in  our  federal
Constitution  today, but  it is  consistent  with  the  idea that  Americans  were  ac-
tually  more  religious  at  the  time  of the  Civil  War and  the  ratification  of the

made of the Fourteenth  Amendment  to  stamp out public  references  to  God  or
religion.

5.  Ceremonial Deism.-In addition  to  these  references  to  God  in  the
preambles  of state  constitutions,  thirty  state  constitutions  in  1868,  or  more
than  three-fourths  of the  total,  contained  references  to  God  that  can  only  be
described  as  a state  constitutional  "endorsement"  of what  the  U.S.  Supreme
Court  in recent years has  sometimes  called "ceremonial  deism. ' ' 96  Examples
of ceremonial  deism include  the use  in constitutional  texts  of such phrases  as
"Almighty  God," 97 "Supreme  Being, the  Great  Creator  and Preserver  of the
Universe,"98   "Author  of 
the  universe," 99   "[A]uthor  of  all  good
government,"' 00  "Sovereign  Ruler  of the  Universe,"101  "Divine  Being,"' 0 2

Brennan explained:

While  I  remain  uncertain  about these  questions,  I would  suggest  that  such  practices  as
the  designation  of "In God  We  Trust"  as  our national  motto,  or  the  references  to God
contained  in  the  Pledge  of  Allegiance  to  the  flag  can  best  be  understood,  in  Dean
Rostow's  apt  phrase,  as a  form  [of]  "ceremonial  deism,"  protected  from  Establishment
Clause  scrutiny  chiefly  because  they  have  lost  through  rote  repetition  any  significant
religious  content.

Id. (footnote  omitted);  see  also Elk  Grove  Unified  Sch.  Dist.  v.  Newdow,  542  U.S.  1,  37  (2004)
(O'Connor,  J.,  concurring). 
In  this  case,  Justice  O'Connor  explained  how  ceremony  can  strip
references to God of their religious  significance:

This  category  of  "ceremonial  deism"  most  clearly  encompasses  such  things  as  the
national  motto ("In  God  We  Trust"),  religious  references  in traditional  patriotic  songs
such as  The  Star-Spangled  Banner,  and the  words with  which the Marshal  of this Court
opens  each  of its  sessions  ("God  save  the  United  States  and  this  honorable  Court").
These  references  are  not  minor trespasses  upon  the Establishment  Clause  to  which  I
turn  a  blind eye.  Instead,  their history,  character,  and context prevent  them  from being
constitutional  violations  at all.

Individual  Rights  Under State  Constitutions  in  1868

There  was  thus  an  Article  V,  three-quarters-of-the-states  consensus  in
1868  that  ceremonial  deism  was  perfectly  consistent  with  the  nonestablish-
ment and  free  exercise  principles.  Looking  at  the  matter  by  population,  we
found  that  a  whopping  88%  of the  American  people  in  1868  lived  in  states
with  constitutions  that  endorsed  ceremonial  deism.  Such  references  to  God
appeared  in  90%  of Northeastern  state  constitutions,  83%  of Midwestern-
Western  state  constitutions,  and  73%  of  Southern  state  constitutions.  Ex-
plicit  textual  references  to  God  were  slightly  more  common  in  the  older
constitutions  in  1868.  Eighty-nine  percent  of the pre-1855  constitutions  had
such  references  as compared  with  74%  of the post-1855  constitutions.

6.  Blaine Amendments.-Blaine amendments  are  provisions  that  forbid
any  kind  of  government  financial  aid  to  educational  or  other  government
institutions  that  have  any  religious  affiliation. 0 5   They  are  named  after
former  Republican  presidential  nominee  James  G.  Blaine  who  originally
proposed  such  an  amendment  to  the  federal  Constitution.'0 6   A  typical
Blaine-amendment  clause  provided,  "[N]o  religious  or  other  sect  or  sects
shall  ever  have  any  exclusive  right  to  or  control  of  any  part  of the  school
funds  of  this  state."'1 7   Such  provisions  would  presumably  strictly  bar
government  financial  aid  to  parochial  schools  and  might  be  argued  to  bar
vouchers  redeemable  at  such  schools  as well.  In  1868,  when  the  Fourteenth
Amendment  was  ratified,  only  eight  state  constitutions-a  relatively  small
minority-contained  Blaine-amendment-like  provisions.  Looking  at  the
matter  by  population,  we  found  that  only  22%  of  the  American  people  in
1868  lived  in  states  with  this  kind  of  clause  in  their  state  constitutions.
Looking  at  the  issue  regionally,  58%  of Midwestern-Western  states,  7%  of
Southern  states,  and  0%  of  Northeastern  states  had  such  clauses.  Blaine-
amendment  clauses  were  evenly  distributed  across  older  and  newer
constitutions.  Today,  many  state  constitutions  have  Blaine  amendments  or
provisions, but our  research  reveals  they were  not a part of the original  public

exercise  thereof;  and  no  money  raised  by  taxation  in  any  State  for  the  support  of public
schools,  or derived  from  any public  fund  therefor, nor any public  lands devoted thereto,  shall

meaning  of  the  nonestablishment  principle  in  1868  when  the  Fourteenth
Amendment  was  ratified.

7.  Clauses  Pertaining  to  Oaths.-Three  states-a  very 

small
minority-contained  explicit  textual  clauses  mandating  that  the  manner  of
administering  an  oath  or  affirmation  to  a  person  ought  to  be  in  accordance
with  his  own  religious  persuasion.  Typically,  such  clauses  provided,  "The
mode  of administering  an  oath  or  affirmation  shall  be  such  as  may  be  most
consistent  with,  and  binding  upon,  the  conscience  of the  person  to  whom
such oath  or  affirmation may be  administered."' 0 8  These  clauses  were  likely
an  accommodation  for religions-such  as  the  Religious  Society  of Friends,
or  Quakers-that  prohibited  the  swearing  of oaths  by their  members.  About
7%  of the  population  in  1868  lived in states  with such clauses  in their bills of
rights.  These  clauses  were most  common  in the Midwest-West,  where  17%
of  the  states  had  them,  as  compared  to  7%  in  the  South  and  0%  in  the
Northeast.  Oaths  clauses  were  found  in  6%  of the  pre-1855  and  in  11%  of
the  post- 1855  constitutions.

8.  Legislative Duty to Protect Religion.-Nebraska, Texas,  and Ohio-

a  small  minority  of states-had  specific  clauses  in  their  state  constitutions
that provided,  typically,  "[I]t  shall  be the  duty  of the  legislature  to pass  such
laws  as  may  be  necessary  to  protect  every  religious  denomination  in  the
peaceable  enjoyment of their  own  mode  of public  worship."10 9  This  protec-
tion  was guaranteed  in states where  9%  of the population  lived in  1868.  Two
of these  states were  in the  Midwest-West,  and one  was  in  the  South.  Duties
to  protect  religion  were  found  in  6%  of the  pre-1855  and  11%  of the  post-
1855  constitutions.  These  clauses  are noteworthy  because  they provide  for a
positive  duty  on government to  foster religious  free  exercise,  rather  than pro-
viding  only  a  negative  bar  on  government  interferences  with  religious  free
exercise.  These  clauses  also  protect  the  freedom  of worship,  which may  in-
volve  action,  and  not  simply  freedom  of  conscience  or  belief.  The  hard
question  posed  by  the  Religious  Freedom  Restoration  Act  is  whether  free-
dom  of  worship  goes  beyond  freedom  to  hold  religious  ceremonies  to
include,  for example,  the  Amish  way  of life  whereby  children  are  not  edu-
cated beyond the  "Three  Rs"  (reading,  'riting,  and 'rithmetic).

9.  Witness  Qualification on  the  Basis  of Religion.-Three  states-a

very  small  minority-had  clauses  in  their  state  constitutions  in  1868  that
provided  that  no person  could  be rendered  incompetent  as  a  witness  as  a  re-
sult  of his religious  beliefs.  One  such clause  stated,  for  example, "No person
shall  be  rendered  incompetent  to  be  a witness  on account  of his  opinions  on

Individual  Rights Under  State Constitutions  in  1868

matters  of religious  belief."1 10  This  protection  was  guaranteed  to  8%  of the
population.  All  three  were  in the  Midwest-West.  Eleven percent  of the  pre-
1855  and  5%  of the post-1855  constitutions contained  these clauses.

B.  Rights  of  Freedom  of  the  Press,  of Speech,  of  Association,  and  of

Political Participation

We  turn  next to  the rights  of freedom  of expression,  which  appear  in
the  federal  First  Amendment  and  which  were  important  protections  at  the
federal  level  against the  suppression  of speech and  of the press.  The  need  for
provisions  like these  was  made  evident  to  Americans  by the  events  that  took
place  in England  during that country's  civil war in the  late  1600s.'l

right 

1.  Freedom of the  Press.-All thirty-seven  state  constitutions  in  1868
had  clauses  that  explicitly  protected  the  freedom  of the  press,  rendering  its
incorporation  as  a  matter of substantive  due process  in  1931 11 2 largely redun-
dant  except  insofar  as  federal  courts  might  construe  such  language  more
liberally  than state  courts  had  done.  Most  of these  clauses  were  worded  like
the  Free  Press  Clause  in  our  federal  First  Amendment,  stating,  for  example,
"No  law  shall  be  passed  restraining  the  free  expression  of opinion,  or  re-
the 
stricting 
to  speak,  write,  or  print  freely  on  any  subject
whatever .... 
Like  the  First  Amendment  of  the  federal  Constitution,
these clauses  were  largely structural  in that  they  limited  the government  with
regard  to  its  constituents.  Some  of  the  clauses,  however,  sounded  more
antimajoritarian 
the
structural  language  for  a  more  individualistic  tone.  For example,  Missouri's
constitution  provided,  "That  the  free  communication  of thoughts  and  opin-
ions is  one  of the  invaluable  rights of man,  and  that  every  person may  freely
speak,  write,  and  print  on  any  subject."'1 14  Obviously,  since  all  thirty-seven
states  in  1868  had  such  clauses  in  their  state  constitutions,  100%  of  the
population  in all three  regions  lived in such  states.  There  was  also  obviously
no difference  here between  older and more  recent  state constitutions.

than  the  First  Amendment,  as  they  had  dropped 

It  bears  noting  that  the  freedom  of  the  press  protected  by  state
constitutional  bills  of  rights 
in  1868  probably  went  beyond  merely  a
protection  against  prior restraints.  While  in  1791,  freedom of the  press  was
arguably  nothing  more than  a protection against  prior  restraints  (as  suggested

by the  scholarship  of Leonard  Levy),1 5 by  1868  the freedom  of the press had
come to be  understood  to forbid  laws  like the  federal  Alien and  Sedition  Acts
of 1798116  and to  also  forbid actions  for seditious  libel.1 17  Exactly  how much
broader  the  original meaning  of the fundamental  right  of freedom  of the press
was in  1868  than  that original  meaning  was  in  1791  is a fascinating  topic  that
unfortunately  goes beyond the scope  of our Article. 1 8

2.  Freedom  of Speech.-Beyond  freedom  of  the  press,  another  core
right of expression  guaranteed  by the federal  Constitution's  First Amendment
is  freedom  of speech.  The  freedom of speech  is  considered  fundamental  be-
cause  it  furthers  self-governance,  aids  the  discovery  of  truth,  promotes
autonomy,  and fosters  tolerance.1 19  It was  incorporated  against the  states  as a
matter of  substantive  due process  in  Gitlow v. New  York in  1925.120

Thus  it  comes  as  no  surprise  that  a full  thirty-two  out  of thirty-seven-

or  more  than  three-quarters-of  the  states  in  1868  explicitly  and  textually
protected  the  right  to  free  speech.  This  is  an  Article  V  consensus  sufficient
for  the  establishment  of federal  constitutional  law.  A  typical  state  constitu-
tional  clause  protecting  freedom  of speech  in  1868  provided,  "No  law  shall
ever  be  passed  to  curtail  or  restrain  the  liberty  of speech  or of the  press. 121
Just  as  a  supermajority  of states  recognized  the right to  freedom  of speech,  a
huge  supermajority  of the  American  people-92%  of the  population-lived
in  states  where  this right  was  recognized.  Looking at the  issue  regionally,  it
turns  out  that  100%  of Midwestern-Western  states  had rights to free  speech,
whereas  only  93%  of Southern  and 60%  of Northeastern  states  did.  Textual
protections  of the  freedom of speech  were found  in 78%  of the pre-1855  con-
stitutions  and  95%  of the  post-1855  constitutions,  so  the  trend  in  American
constitutional  law  at the  state  level  in  1868  was  toward  more  protection  for

Individual  Rights Under  State Constitutions  in  1868

freedom  of  speech.  Most  free-speech  clauses  were  intertwined  with  free-
press clauses  and had the  same  characteristics,  described  above.  Unlike  their
modem  federal  counterpart,  however,  many  of the  state  constitutions  speci-
fied  that  citizens  were  responsible  for  the  abuse  of  their  right  to  free
speech. 122  Not  all  press  clauses  were  tethered  to  speech  clauses.  Virginia,
for instance, provided a  strong populist protection  that stood alone:  "That  the
freedom  of the press  is one  of the great  bulwarks  of liberty,  and can never  be
restrained but by despotic  governments." 123

3.  Assembly  and  Petition.-The third  right  of  political  participation
guaranteed  by the  First Amendment  to  the  federal  Constitution  is the  right to
assemble  peaceably  and  to  petition  the  government  for  the  redress  of
grievances. 124  This right also appears  to have  been a fundamental  right under
state  constitutional  law in  1868.  A full  thirty-four  states,  or more  than  three-
quarters  of the total,  protected  the  right  of citizens  to peaceably  assemble  for
their  common  good  and to  petition  the  government.  Once  again,  this  is  an
Article  V consensus  for creating  federal constitutional  law.  A supermajority
of the  American  people-94%-lived  in  states  where  these  rights  were pro-
tected  in  1868.  Protection  of these  rights was  found in  100%  of Northeastern
states,  92%  of Midwestem-Western  states,  and  87%  of Southern  states.  All
included  assembly-and-petition  clauses,
of  the  pre-1855  constitutions 
whereas  84%  of the post-1855  constitutions  had them.  The  rights to  freedom
of assembly  and  petition  thus  were  seen  as  being  implicit  in  the  concept  of
ordered  liberty-along  with  the  rights  to  freedom  of  the  press  and  of
speech-in  1868.

Typical  state  constitutional  language used  to protect  these  rights read:
"The  people  shall  have  the  right  freely  to  assemble  together,  to  consult  for
the  common  good, to  instruct  their  representatives,  and  to  petition  the  legis-
lature  for redress  of grievances." 125  One  state,  Delaware,  was  considerably
more  cautious  about  its  grant of the  right of free  assembly.  Delaware's  con-
stitution thus provided:

to  laws  by  a  part  of  the  people,  upon
Although  disobedience 
suggestions  of  impolicy  or  injustice  in  them,  tends,  by  immediate
effect  and  the  influence  of example,  not  only  to  endanger  the  public
welfare  and  safety,  but  also  in governments  of a  republican  form  con-
founded  on
travenes 
common consent  for common  good, yet the  citizens  have  a right  in  an
orderly  manner  to  meet  together,  and  to  apply  to  persons  intrusted

the  social  principles  of  such  governments 

122.  E.g.,  OHIO  CONST.  of  1851,  art.  I,  §  11  ("Every  citizen  may  freely  speak,  write,  and

publish  his sentiments on  all  subjects, being  responsible  for  the  abuse of the  right .... ").

with  the  powers  of  government  for  redress  of  grievances  or  other
proper purposes,  by petition, remonstrance,  or address. 126

The  rights  of  assembly  and  petition  were  incorporated  against  the  states
through the  Fourteenth Amendment  in  1937  and  1939,  respectively. 127

4.  Reform  Government.-The  state  bills  of  rights,  strikingly,  go  well
beyond  the  First Amendment  to  the  federal  Constitution  in  protecting  rights
of political  participation.  A very large  number of states-twenty-six,  or two-
thirds  but not three-quarters  of the thirty-seven  states  in the  Union  in  1868-
explicitly  gave  their  citizens  the  right  to  alter,  reform,  or  abolish  their  gov-
ernment  as  they  saw  proper.  A  typical  state  constitutional  clause protecting
such  a right  in  1868  provided,  "All  power  is  inherent  in  the  people;  all  free
governments  are  founded  in  their  authority,  and  instituted  for their  benefit;
they  have,  therefore,  an  unalienable  and  indefeasible  right  to  institute
government,  and  to  alter,  reform,  or  totally  change  the  same,  when  their
safety and  happiness require  it. ' ' 128  An  additional  four  states  contained  weak
language  that  may  have  implied  something  of the  same  kind  of popular
power.129  Fourteen  years  ago,  Professor Akhil  Amar  argued  in  a  law  review
article  that  the  Framers  understood  that  constitutional  change  or  amendment
was  possible  outside  the  strictures  of Article  V  of the  federal Constitution. 130
These  clauses  arguably  suggest that a lot  of states,  although not  an Article  V
consensus  of the  states,  recognized  a fundamental  right  of the  people to  alter
or abolish  their forms of government.

Looking  at  this  issue  regionally,  90%  of  people 

Looking  at the  issue  by population  instead of by  a nose count  or tally
of  state  constitutions,  it  turns  out  that  strong  alter-and-reform-government
clauses  were present in  state  constitutions  where  65%  of the  population  lived
in  1868. 
living  in
Northeastern  states  had  them,  67%  of people  living  in  Southern  states  had
them,  but  only  58%  of people  living  in  Midwestern-Western  states  were  so
empowered.  We  do not know why  there  was  such  a large  regional  variation.
Clauses  recognizing  a popular power  to  alter  or abolish  forms of government
were  slightly  more  common  in  older  state  constitutions.  We  found  them  in
78%  of the pre-1855  and 63%  of the post-1855  constitutions.

Individual Rights  Under  State Constitutions  in  1868

5.  Power  over  Government  Officers.-A  very  small  minority  of
states-four  states  to  be  precise-recognized  that  their citizens  had  a funda-
mental  claim  of  power  over  their  government  officers.  One  such  state
constitutional  clause  stated,  for example,  "That  all  power  is  vested  in,  and
consequently  derived  from,  the  people;  that magistrates  are their  trustees  and
servants,  and  at all  times  amenable  to  them." '31  What  this meant  concretely
we  do  not know.  Ten  percent  of the  population  in  1868  lived  in  states  with
clauses  of this  type  in  their  state  constitutions,  and these  clauses  were  found
exclusively  in  the  Northeast,  where  20%  of the  states  had  them,  and  in  the
South,  where  13%  of the  states  had  them.  They  were  equally  common  in
recent  and  older  constitutions.  Virginia  and  Massachusetts  each  had  two
clauses  allocating  such  power  to  citizens. 132   Generally,  they  permitted  the
people  to  regulate  government  officers  and hold  the  officers  accountable  to
them.133  Massachusetts  stated  that  these  powers  are  necessary  to  prevent
those vested with authority  from becoming  oppressors. 34

6.  LibeL-Strikingly,  notwithstanding  the  Article  V  consensus  in  1868
supporting  a  fundamental  right to  freedom  of the press  and of speech,  a huge
number  of state  constitutions  at that time  explicitly  contemplated  libel  suits,
apparently  not  thinking  that  such  suits  posed  any  conflict  with  the  funda-
mental  rights  protected.  This  is  arguably  surprising  given  the  fact  that  the
First  Amendment  was  so  popular  precisely  because  it  was  thought  to  wipe
out  some  of the  English  common  law  bans  on libel. 135  Such  evidence  from
state  constitutions  could  call  into  question  the  use  of  the  federal  First
Amendment  to limit  libel  suits at  least by  states,  which  are  constrained  only
by  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  and  not directly  by  the  First.  However,  most
state  constitutional  clauses  did  allow  for  acquittal  if the  matter  charged  as
libelous  was  found  to  be  true-a  protection 
that  was  not  present  in
England.

ability  of libel  suits  were  present  in  78%  of the  pre-1855  and  63%  of the
post-1855  constitutions.  Some  states  provided  that,  in all  libel suits,  the jury
was  to determine  both the  law  and the  facts.1 38  Others  provided  for acquittal
should  the  jury  find  that  the  matter  charged  as  libelous  was  "true,  and  was
published  with  good motives  and  for justifiable  ends."'139

7.  Suffrage.-The  Supreme  Court  has  called  the  right  to  vote  a
"fundamental  political right"  that  is the  "preservative  of all  rights."' 4 °  It has
stated,  "The  right  to  vote  freely  for the  candidate  of one's  choice  is  of the
essence of a democratic  society, and  any  restrictions on that right  strike at  the
heart  of representative  government."1 41  It is therefore  perhaps  surprising that
only  seven  states  in  1868-a small  minority-protected  the  right  of suffrage
in their  state  constitutions, although  arguably the  centrality  of the  right might
have  caused  some  constitution  makers  not  to  think of mentioning  it.  A typi-
cal  state  constitutional  clause  protecting  the  right  to  suffrage  read:  "The
privilege  of free  suffrage  shall be  supported by  laws  regulating  elections  and
prohibiting  under adequate  penalties  all  undue  influence  thereon  from power,
bribery,  tumult,  or  other  improper  practice."1 42  Twenty-five  percent  of the
population  in  1868  lived in  states  with  rights of this  kind.  Such  rights were
found  in 40%  of Southern  states  and  in  10%  of Northeastern  states but not  in
any  Midwestern-Western  state  constitutions.  Eleven percent  of the pre-1855
and 26%  of the post-1855  states had suffrage  rights of this kind.

8.  Free Elections.-Sixteen states-a  minority  that  was  more  than  one-
quarter  but less  than one-half of the  thirty-seven  states in  1868-had  clauses

137.  FLA.  CONST.  of 1868,  art. I, §  10.
138.  See, e.g.,  NEB.  CONST.  of 1866,  art. I,  § 3  ("In all  criminal  prosecutions  or  indictments  for
libel  the  truth  may  be  given  in  evidence...  and  the jury  shall  have  the  right  to determine  the  law
and  the  fact.").

Individual  Rights Under State  Constitutions  in  1868

in  their  state  constitutions  that  explicitly  provided  for  the  holding  of  free
elections.  Ten  of the  sixteen  states  provided  that  the  elections  be  free  and
equal. 1 43  Missouri  provided that  they be free  and  open, 144 Maryland  provided
that  they  be  free  and  frequent, 145  and  South  Carolina  provided  that  they  be
free,  open,  and  equal. 146   Forty-eight  percent  of  the  American  people  in
1868-nearly  a majority  of the  population-lived  in states  with  constitutions
that  protected  this right.  Free-election  guarantees  were  most  common  in the
Northeast,  at  50%  of states,  followed  by 47%  in  the  South,  and  25%  in  the
Midwest-West.  Fifty  percent  of the  pre-1855  constitutions  and  32%  of the
post-1855  constitutions  had  free-election  clauses.

9.  One  Person,  One  Vote.-One  interesting  question  of  political
participation  is  whether  there  is  a  fundamental  right  to  reapportionment  of
the  legislature-a fight  the Warren  Court found  in the  federal  Constitution  as
the  right  of  "one  person,  one  vote."'147   Only  four  state  constitutions  in
1868-a  very small minority-provided  explicitly  that "[r]epresentation  shall
be  apportioned  according  to  population. 1 48  Four  percent  of the  population
lived  in  states  where  this right  was  guaranteed.  The  right  was  found  in  17%
of the  three  Midwestern-Western  state  constitutions,  in  13%  of  Southern
state  constitutions,  and  in  none  of the  Northeastern  state  constitutions.  A
right to  reapportionment  was  more  common  in newer  constitutions,  as  it was
included  in 6%  of the  pre-1855  state  constitutions  and  16%  of the  post-1855
It  may  be  that  newer  and  Midwestern-Western  states  in  the
constitutions. 
1860s  were  coming  to  realize  that  the  failure  to  mandate  reapportionment
was  a flaw in the older Northeastern  state  constitutions.

10.  No Right to  Secession from the  Union.-If the  people of a  state  have
a  fundamental  right to  alter  and  abolish their forms  of government when  they
find  them to  be oppressive,  the question  will naturally  arise whether they also
have  a  fundamental  right  to  secede  from  the union  of the  states.  This  was  a

question  of great  interest  in  1868  in  the  wake  of the  Civil  War. 
It  is  thus
perhaps  not  surprising  that  eleven  state  constitutions 
in  1868  make  it
explicitly  clear  that  whatever  fundamental  right  the  people  have  to  alter  or
abolish  their  forms  of  government,  that  right  does  not  include  a  right  to
secede.  A  typical  clause  of this  kind  read,  "This  State  shall  ever  remain  a
member  of the  American  Union,  the  people  thereof a  part  of the  American
nation, and  any attempt,  from whatever  source,  or upon whatever pretense,  to
dissolve  said  Union,  or to  sever said  nation,  shall  be resisted  with the  whole
power  of the  State."' 149  A  twelfth  state's constitution,  Louisiana's,  contained
a  weaker  declaration  of allegiance  to  the  Union. 50  Looking  at this question
by  population,  it turns  out that  23%  of the  American  people  in  1868  lived in
states  with  strong  secession  prohibitions  in  their  state  constitutions.  Fully
67%,  or  two-thirds,  of  Southern  state  constitutions  contained  no-secession
clauses,  compared  with  8%  of  the  constitutions  of  Midwestern-Western
states  and  none  of constitutions  of the  Northeastern  states.  Secession  was
prohibited  in  only  6%  of the  pre-1855  constitutions  but  it  was  prohibited  in
53%-a  majority-of the  post-1855  constitutions.  Obviously,  Congress  in
the  1860s  was  insisting  on  antisecession  clauses  in  state  constitutions  both
when  admitting  new  Midwestern-Western  states  to  the  Union  and  when  al-
lowing  the  eleven  Confederate  states  to  re-enter  the  Union  in  reconstructed
form.  The  antisecession  principle  thus  is  an  important  qualification  of the
fundamental  right of the people to  alter or  abolish their forms  of government,
at least as  it had come  to be understood  by  1868.

11.  Arbitrary Power.-Two  states  had  explicit  clauses  in  their  state
constitutions  in  1868  that protected  against  exercises  of arbitrary government
power.  Kentucky's  constitution  stated,  "That  absolute,  arbitrary  power  over
the  lives,  liberty,  and  property  of freemen  exists  nowhere  in  a  republic,  not
largest  majority."' 51   Tennessee's  constitution  provided,
even 
"[G]overnment  being  instituted for the  common  benefit,  the  doctrine  of non-
resistance  against  arbitrary  power  and  oppression  is  absurd,  slavish,  and  de-
structive  to  the  good  and  happiness  of mankind."' 152  The  number  of people
living  in  these  two  states  constituted  7% of the total U.S.  population  in  1868.
This  protection  appears  only  in these  two  Southern  state  constitutions,  which
comprised  13%  of all  Southern  constitutions.  Rights  of this  kind  were  not
present in any post- 1855  constitution.

Individual Rights  Under  State Constitutions  in  1868

12.  Federal Allegiance.-Three states-North  Carolina,  South  Carolina,
and  Missouri-had  specific  clauses  in  their  state  constitutions  that  declared
that every  citizen of the state  owed paramount  allegiance  to  the United States
and  to  the  U.S.  Constitution.  The  three  clauses  were  virtually  identical,
stating,  "Every  citizen  of  this  State  owes  paramount  allegiance  to  the
Constitution  and Government  of the  United  States,  and no  law  or  ordinance
of this  State  in  contravention  or  subversion  thereof  can  have  any  binding
force."' 153  The  percentage  of the  American  people  living  in  states  with  such
clauses  in their constitutions  in  1868 was  9%  of the total  population.  Federal
allegiance  was  only  demanded  of Southerners,  and  the  clause  was  found  in
20%  of Southern  state  constitutions.  It  was  found  exclusively  in  post-1855
constitutions.  Again,  these  clauses,  like  the  antisecession  clauses,  were  ob-
viously  part  of  the  price  the  Reconstruction  Congress  extracted  from  the
seceded  Southern  states  for  letting them back into the Union.  North  Carolina
and  South  Carolina  were  part  of the  Confederacy,  and  the  Missouri  legisla-
ture  passed  a secession  bill  but  was  kept  outside the  Confederacy  by its  pro-
Union state  government. 154

C.  Protection of Gun Rights and Clauses Bearing on the Military

The  Bill  of  Rights  of  the  federal  Constitution  protects  religious
freedom first, freedom  of expression  second,  and gun rights  third.  This  could
be  argued  to  reflect  the  priority the  ratifiers  and  framers  attached  to  each  of
these  sets  of rights,  although  there  were  two  amendments  proposed  in  1791
ahead  of the  First  that  were  not  ratified  at that  time. 155  Gun  rights  are  pro-
tected  by  the  federal  Constitution  in  the  Second  Amendment,  which  was
interpreted this  year in  the  Supreme  Court's  opinion  in District of Columbia
v. Heller.15 6  As the  majority and dissenting  opinions  in Heller indicate,  there
is  a  famous  and  longstanding  debate  over  whether  the  Second  Amendment
protects  an  individual's  right  to  own a  gun  for his  self-defense  or  whether  it

competing  claims  for  legitimacy  between  Missouri's  pro-Union  government,  which  occupied  the
state  capitol,  and  its  pro-Confederacy  government,  which  fled  the  capitol,  voted  for  secession, and
was granted  admission  to the  Confederacy).

that  congressional  pay  increases  would  not  take  effect  until  there  had  been  an  intervening

Seventh  Amendment.  Id. at  17.  While  it  is  true  that  the  Amendments  in  the  Bill  of Rights  were
listed in an order that would  allow them to be interlineated  in the  original  Constitution, it is  also true
that the  first ten Amendments  as  actually ratified were  qualifications  of congressional powers  under
Article  I, Section  Eight.  See  id. at  36-37  (explaining  that  the  Bill  of Rights  limited  the  powers
originally  conferred  to  Congress  under  Article  I,  Section  Eight  of  the  U.S.  Constitution).  The
ordering  of these qualifications  could therefore  be said to be  significant.

protects  a  collective  right  of the  people  of a  state  to  own  rifles  so  they  can
serve  as  members  of a well-regulated  state militia. 157  The  framers  of the  fed-
eral  Constitution  did  arguably  favor  state  militias  of  armed  citizens  over
standing  armies  of mercenaries,  which  might abuse  liberty and threaten  dem-
ocratic  government. 15 8  Such  mercenaries  had  historically  been  quartered  in
private  citizens'  homes,  which  was  an  abuse  of  liberty.159  The  Third
Amendment  to  the  federal  Bill  of  Rights  limits  the  federal  government's
power to  quarter troops  in people's  homes. 160  What, then,  did  state  constitu-
tions  say  in  1868  about  whether there  was  a  fundamental  right to  own  guns?
Was  such  a  right  an  individual  right  in  1868  or  was  it  merely  a  collective
right enjoyed by  the state  militias?  What about  standing  armies  or quartering
soldiers  in homes?  It turns out that all of these topics were addressed by state
constitutions  in  1868.

1.  State  Constitutional Rights  to  Keep  and Bear Arms.-Twenty-two
state  constitutions  in  1868-a  majority  but  not  an  Article  V,  federal-
constitutional-law-making 
explicitly
guaranteed  the right of the people to  keep and bear arms.  As we  will explain,
there was  a lot  of variation  in the way  these  clauses were  worded, but twelve
states-a  majority  of  the  state  clauses  in  question-explicitly  provided,
"[T]he  people have  a right to  bear arms for the  defence  of themselves  and the
State." 161  Thus  a majority  of the  state  constitutional  clauses  protecting  gun
rights  did  textually  describe  the  rights in  question  as  being  individual  rather
than merely collective  rights.  In other states,  courts  may well have  construed
Second  Amendment  analogs  as  protecting  individual  rights.  But it  is  quite
clear  that  only  twenty-two  out  of thirty-seven  states  in  1868  had  explicit
Second  Amendment  analogs  in  their  state  constitutions.  There  was  thus  not
an  Article  V  consensus  of the  states  that  Second  Amendment  analogs  were
per  se  explicitly  fundamental  federal  constitutional  rights,  and  so  there  cer-
tainly  was  no  such  consensus  as  to  an  individual's  right  to  own guns  for  his

own  self-defense.  As  we  shall  see  below,  however, 
is
complicated  significantly  by  other clauses  in  state constitutions  that were  not
Second  Amendment  analogs but that may  well have  protected gun rights.

the  question 

Looking  at  this  question  by  population,  however,  yields  a  result  more
favorable  to  the  claim  that  there  is  a  fundamental  right  to  own  guns.  Fully
61%  of the  population  in  1868-a  slight  supermajority-lived  in  states  with
explicit  analogs  to  the  Second  Amendment  in  their  state  constitutions.  The
explicit right to  keep and bear arms was  most widely recognized  in  state  con-
stitutions  in  the  South  in  1868,  where  73%  of the  states  recognized  such
rights.  Protection  of gun  rights  was  found  in  only  60%  of Northeastern
states,  and  in  only  42%  of  Midwestern-Western  states,  even  though  the
threat  of Indian  raids  might  have  been  expected  to  make  protection  of gun
rights more  common in the West.  Note that state  constitutional protection  for
gun  rights  is below  50%  of the total  population  in Midwestem-Western  state
constitutions.  We  find this regional  data  to be  intriguing  because  it  suggests
that  the  protection  of gun  rights  was  particularly  Southern  as  long  ago  as
1868.  This  could  arguably  be  explained  by  Southern  fears  of slave  revolts
and, later on, of freed African-Americans.  Alternatively,  it could be the  result
of the  Reconstruction  Congress  insisting  on  gun fights  in  Southern  state  con-
stitutions  in  order  to  protect  African-Americans.  The  historical  data  are
fascinating  because  strong  support  for gun  rights continues  to  be  an  impor-
tant part of Southern culture today  even  though  such  support has  faded  in the
Northeast. 162

Protection  in  state  constitutions  for gun  rights  was  equally  common  in
older  and newer  constitutions.  Twelve  of the  state  constitutions  in  question
explicitly  stated  that  gun  rights  were being  protected  for the  defense  of indi-
vidual  citizens  themselves  in  addition  to  being  protected  for  the  defense  of
the  state  through  membership  in  the  militia. 163  Other constitutions  that  were
less textually explicit may well have  been construed to  protect individual  gun
rights.  Tennessee's  state  constitution  tellingly  only  guaranteed  the  right  to
own  guns  for  free  white  men. 164   Three  state  constitutions  provided  for
government  regulation,  and limitation,  of the right to bear arms. 165

Texas  Law Review

[Vol.  87:7

The  number  of states  guaranteeing  the  right  to  bear  arms  may  seem
surprisingly  low given both  the prevalence  of guns in  1868 and  the continued
salience  of gun-rights  debates  today.  As  we just noted above,  it  is  quite  pos-
sible  that  the  right  to  bear  arms  was  implicitly  embedded  in  other  state
constitutional  rights  in  1868.  As we  shall  see,  many  state  constitutions  spe-
cifically  protected  as  a  matter  of  state  positive  law  the  "natural  and
inalienable  rights"  of  the  people,  among  which  was  often  the  right  "to
defend"  life  and  liberty  and  "to  protect"  property. 166  These  rights may  very
well  have  encompassed  a  right  to  bear  arms,  although  proving  that  would
require  further  research. 167  In  1868,  fourteen  states  had  individual  rights  to
defend life and property,  including seven  states that  did not also have  explicit
right-to-bear-arms  clauses.  Thus,  counting  the  right  to  defend  life,  liberty,
and property  increases  the  number  of states  (implicitly  or explicitly)  protect-
ing  the  right  to  bear  arms  from  twenty-two  to  twenty-nine.  Under  this
expanded  view,  a full 78%  of states-a supermajority-guaranteed  a right  to
bear  arms.  This  would  be  an  Article  V,  three-quarters  consensus  for  some
right to  defend life,  liberty,  and property by force  of arms.

Today,  the  question of whether  we  have  a fundamental  individual  right
to keep  and bear arms  for our own defense  and  not as part of a state  militia  is
particularly  important  because  the  Second  Amendment  is  one  of the  few
parts  of the Federal  Bill  of Rights  that has not yet been  incorporated  to  apply
against  the  states  by  virtue  of the  Fourteenth  Amendment. 168  Now  that  the
Supreme  Court has  construed  the Second Amendment  in Heller as protecting
an  individual's  right  to  keep  and  bear  arms,' 69  the  question  of whether  that
right  ought  to  be  incorporated  will  become  much more  important.  Our  data
suggest that  explicit  Second  Amendment  analogs  were  less  common  in  state
constitutions  in  1868 than were rights to freedom  of religion  or of expression,
but they were recognized  by a majority  of the thirty-seven  states in  1868,  and
a number  of other  states  may  have  protected such  rights  implicitly. v°  What
one  should  do  with this  information,  if anything,  is  debatable.  Furthermore,
the  Supreme  Court  has  only  recently--on  a  five-to-four  vote-settled  the
debate  as  to  whether  the  Second  Amendment  guarantees  a collective  right  to

166.  E.g.,  N.J.  CONST.  of  1844,  art.  I,  §  1 ("All  men  are  by  nature  free  and  independent,  and
have  certain  natural  and  unalienable  rights,  among  which  are those  of enjoying  and  defending  life
and  liberty, acquiring,  possessing,  and protecting  property,  and of pursuing and  obtaining  safety  and
happiness.").

167.  For a  description  of these  rights  in  modem  state  constitutions,  see  Eugene  Volokh,  State
Constitutional Rights of Self-Defense  and Defense of Property, 11  TEX.  REV.  L.  & POL.  400,  401-

Individual  Rights Under  State Constitutions  in  1868

a  state  militia1"  or  an  individual  right to  keep  and  bear  arms to  protect  and
provide  for oneself and one's  own  family. 172  It  remains  to  be  seen  whether
this majority will endure. 3

An  amicus  brief submitted  to the  Supreme  Court in the Heller case by
the  City  of Chicago  argued that an  individual  right to  gun ownership  was  not
fundamental  and,  therefore,  that  the  Second  Amendment  should  not  be  in-
corporated  against  the  states  through  the  Fourteenth  Amendment. 174   The
brief referred to  the  Court's  four-factor incorporation  test  outlined  in Duncan
v.  Louisiana,175  which  held that  a  right was  more  likely  to  be  fundamental  if
it  was  protected  by  the  thirteen  original  state  constitutions,  in  the  constitu-
tions  of  every  state  entering  the  Union  thereafter,  and  in  modem  state
constitutions. 176 The  City  of Chicago's Heller brief then proceeded  to  count
the  original  state  constitutions  that  either  explicitly  or  implicitly  declined  to
provide an  individual  right to bear arms. 177

The  fact  that  a nontrivial  minority-twelve  states-explicitly  protected
both  a  collective  and an  individual  right  to  keep  and bear  arms  in  1868  pro-
vides  an interesting  twist with  respect  to this  issue. 178  The  fact that  the  right
was  such a distinctively  Southern  one  in  1868 may also bear  on whether most

(1987)  (examining  the Constitution's  expansion  of the federal  government's  military powers  and the
framers'  view  of state militias  as a  "vital"  check on those powers).

172.  The first  federal  circuit  court decision  to interpret the  Second  Amendment as  containing  an

individual right to bear arms  was United States v. Emerson, 270  F.3d 203  (5th  Cir.  2001).

American  history  of the  putative  right;  (2)  its recognition  in  the  constitutions  of the  original  States;

impressive  support  for  considering  the  right  to  jury  trial  in  criminal  cases  to  be
fundamental  to  our  system  of justice,  an  importance  frequently  recognized  in  the
opinions of this  Court.

2.  The  Right  Not 

to  Bear  Arms.-Seventeen  states-a  minority,
although  a  fairly  substantial  one-had  clauses  that  expressly  prohibited
compelling people who  are conscientiously  (or otherwise)  opposed to bearing
arms  from  being  compelled  to  do  so  or  from being  drafted  into  militia  duty.
Typically,  such  clauses  provided, "[N]o  person who  conscientiously  scruples
to  bear arms  shall  be compelled  to do  so,  but  may pay  an equivalent  for per-
sonal  service.0 79  It is worth noting  that we  are talking  here  only about  those
state  constitutions  that  explicitly  recognize  conscientious-objector  status;
other  states  in  1868  probably  understood  their  freedom-of-worship  and
freedom-of-conscience  clauses 
to  make  such  an  explicit  recognition  of
conscientious-objector  status unnecessary.  Alternatively,  it  could  be  argued
that  the very  fact that  seventeen  states  thought  specific  language  was  neces-
sary  means  that  conscientious-objector  status  was  not  seen  as  being
encompassed  by  freedom  of conscience,  profession,  or  belief.  The  federal
Constitution  makes  no  direct  reference 
to  conscientious  objection  and,
interestingly,  the  only  attempt  by  the  Supreme  Court  to  define  the  scope  of

Individual  Rights Under  State Constitutions  in  1868

"religion"  involved  statutory  construction  of  the  Selective  Service  Act, 8 °
which established  a religious  exemption to  the military  draft. 181

An explicit  textual  right  not  to bear  arms in  the military  was  enjoyed  by
590/--a  majority-of  the  population  in  1868.  Such  a  right  was  found  in
50%  of  Midwestern-Westem  state  constitutions,  47%  of  Southern  state
constitutions,  and  40%  of Northeastern  state  constitutions.  Most  of the  state
constitutions  in  question  provided  that  such exemption  from  military  service
required  that  the  person  exempted  provide  financial  compensation  to  the
state. 18   A typical  clause read:  "No  person  conscientiously  opposed  to  bear-
ing arms  shall  be compelled  to  do  militia  duty;  but  such person  shall  pay  an
equivalent  for exemption,  the  amount to be prescribed  by law."' 183

3.  Clauses Subordinating the Military to the Civil Power.-It is argued
that  one  of  the  core  purposes  of the  Second  Amendment  to  the  federal
Constitution  was  to  protect  against  a  federal  standing  army,  which  might
extinguish  liberty, by constitutionally  protecting  state  militias  in  which  every
free  adult  male  is  a  member  and  has  his  own  gun.' 84   This  theme  of
subordinating  the  military 
to  the  civil  power  turns  out  to  have  been
widespread  in  1868  when  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  was  ratified.  Fully
thirty-five  out  of  thirty-seven  states-or  an  Article  V, 
three-quarters
majority-had  clauses  in their  state  constitutions  mandating  that  the  military
be  in  strict  subordination  to  the  civil  power.  Generally,  these  state  constitu-
tional provisions  provided,  "[T]he  military  shall, in  all  cases  and  at all times,
be  in strict  subordination  to  the civil  power.,' 85  There may  or may  not have
been  an  explicit  Article  V,  federal-constitutional  consensus  that  individuals
had  a  right  to  own  guns  for their  self-defense,  but  there  was  clearly  such  a
consensus  declaring  it  a  fundamental  right  to  live  in  a  society  without  a
standing  army  and  in  which  the  military  is  subordinate  to  the  civil  power.
What,  if anything,  one  could do  to assert  such  a right  in the  modern  world  is
debatable,  to say the  least.

A  huge  supermajority  of Americans  in  1868  lived  in states  with clauses
of this kind  in their state  constitutions-85%  of the  population.  Such  clauses
were  found  in  100%  of  the  constitutions  of  Midwestern-Western  state

Northeastern  state  constitutions.  Protection  of this  right  was  equally  com-
mon  both in older  and newer constitutions.

4.  Clauses  Forbidding  Standing  Armies.-A  number  of  state
constitutions  in  1868  explicitly  forbade  the  existence  of  standing  armies.
This  is  striking  given  that  the  United  States  has  had  a  standing  army  for  a
very  long  time  now-and  a  very  large  standing  army  since  at  least  World
War  II.  Twenty-one  states  in  1868,  or a majority but  not a two-thirds  super-
majority,  prohibited  the  maintenance  of standing  armies  in  times  of peace.
Clauses forbidding  standing  armies  were often  coupled  with clauses  subordi-
nating  the  military  to  the  civil  power.  Such  clauses  typically  stated,  "No
standing  army  shall  be kept  up  without  the  consent  of the  legislature. 186  A
solid  majority  of  the  American  people 
total
population-lived 
in  states  that  had  constitutions  that  forbade  standing
armies.  The  prohibition  on  standing  armies  was  found  in  60%  of  both
Northeastern  and  Southern  state  constitutions  and  in  50%  of Midwestern-
Western  state  constitutions. 
It  was  equally  common  in  older  and  newer
constitutions.  Three  of  these  states  provided  somewhat  weaker  limits,
providing  that  standing  armies  "ought to be avoided."1 87

5. Quartering Soldiers. -Federal  gun  rights in  the  Second  Amendment
are  followed by the  Third  Amendment's  constraints  on  quartering  soldiers  in
private  homes,  which is another  way  of subordinating  the military  to the  civil
power.  Twenty-seven  states-or  two-thirds  but  not  an  Article  V  consensus
of three-quarters-had  provisions  in  their  state  constitutions  that  prohibited
the  quartering  of soldiers  in  private  homes  without  the  consent  of the  owner
in  times  of peace.  These  clauses  usually provided, "No  soldier  shall,  in  time
of peace,  be  quartered  in any  house  without  the  consent  of the  owner,  nor in
time  of war  except in  the manner  to  be prescribed  by law."'188  A supermajor-
ity  of  the  population  in  1868-72%  of  the  American  people,  but  not  an
Article  V,  three-quarters  supermajority-lived  in  states  with  constitutions
that prohibited quartering  soldiers  in private  homes.  Such prohibitions  could
be  found  in  80%  of  the  Northeastern  state  constitutions,  in  75%  of  the
Midwestern-Western  state  constitutions,  and  in  67%  of the  Southern  state
constitutions  in  1868.  Clauses  forbidding the quartering  of soldiers  in private
homes  were  somewhat  more  common  in  older  state  constitutions  in  1868
than  in  newer  ones,  suggesting  that  this  may  have  been  an  evil  whose  time

was  past.  Quartering  clauses  were present  in  83%  of the pre-1855  but in only
63%  of the  post-1855  constitutions.  Although  quartering  clauses  are  seem-
ingly  obsolete,  the  Quartering  Act of 1774  was  one  of the  "Intolerable  Acts"
of  the  British  Parliament 189  and  undoubtedly  left  lingering  apprehension  of

Amendment's  Quartering  Clause  has  not  yet  been  incorporated  against  the

D.  Fourth Amendment Rights Against Unreasonable Searches and Seizures
The  fourth  subject  discussed  by  the  federal  Bill  of  Rights-after
religion,  free  expression,  and  guns  and  the  military-is  the  protection  of an
individual  from  unreasonable  searches  and  seizures.  This  is  a core  aspect  of
the  right  to  privacy  and  constitutes  a  fundamental  limit  on  government
power.  Unsurprisingly,  this  right  turns  out to  have  been  very  widely  recog-
nized  in  1868  in state  constitutional  law.

1.  Search and Seizure.-Thirty-four  states  out  of thirty-seven in  1868-

or  a three-fourths  majority-gave  people  the  right  to  be  free  from  unreason-
able  searches  and  seizures.  This  is  a federal  consensus  of the kind  sufficient
to  make  federal  constitutional  law  under Article  V  of the  U.S.  Constitution.
Clauses  protecting  such  rights  typically provided,  "The  right of the people  to
be  secure  in  their  persons,  houses,  papers,  and  effects  against  unreasonable
seizures  and  searches  shall not be violated  ... ."'90  This  language  mimics the
federal Fourth  Amendment.' 91  Looking  at matters  by population,  it turns  out
that  84%  of Americans  living in  1868  lived  in  states  with these  kinds of pro-
tections  in  their  constitutions.  Such  protections  were  found  in  82%  of
Midwestern-Western 
state
constitutions,  and  in  60%  of Northeastern  state  constitutions.  Ninety-four
percent  of the  pre-1855  and  89%  of  the  post-1855  constitutions  prohibited
unreasonable  searches  and  seizures.  No  state  constitution,  however,  pro-
vided  for a  mechanism  of enforcement  of these  rights  through,  for  example,
the  exclusion  of evidence  obtained  in  violation  of them.  There  was  thus  an
Article  V  consensus  in  the  states  in  1868  that  freedom  from  unreasonable
searches  and  seizures  was  a  fundamental  right  that  was  implicit  in  the

in  reaction  to  the  Boston  Tea Party-the  Boston  Port  Act,  the  Massachusetts  Regulatory  Act,  the

2.  Warrants and  Probable Cause.-The  federal  Fourth  Amendment
also  sets rules  for the  issuance  of warrants,  a protection  that  was  designed  in
response  to  the  controversial  writs  of assistance,  which  were  a  significant
factor leading  up  to  the  American  Revolution.1 94  Thirty-six  states  in  1868-
or once  again  an Article V,  three-quarters  consensus-had provisions  in their
constitutions  requiring all  warrants to  be  supported by  oath  or affirmation,  to
describe  particularly  the  person  or things  to be  seized,  and  to  be  issued only
with  probable  cause.  These  clauses  were  invariably paired  with  search-and-
seizure  clauses,  as  they  are  in  the  Fourth  Amendment,  and  they  typically
stated,  "[N]o  warrant  shall  issue  but  on probable  cause,  supported by  oath  or
affirmation,  particularly  describing the  place  to  be  searched,  and the  persons
and things  to  be  seized." 195  Looking at matters  by population,  a huge  super-
majority  of the  American people  in  1868  lived  in  states  that  recognized  this
right in their state  constitutions-fully  89%.  Protection  of this right  could be
found  in  100%  of the  constitutions  of  Southern  and  Midwestern-Western
states,  and  in 90%  of the constitutions  of Northeastern  states.  The  only  state
constitution  without  this  right  was  ratified  before  1855.  The  right  to  a
warrant  supported  by  probable  cause  was  slightly  weaker  in  the  Vermont
constitution  at  the  time,  which  emphasized  that  such  warrants  ought not  be
granted, rather than banning them outright. 96

E.  Criminal Procedure

The  fifth  major topic  addressed  by  the  Bill  of Rights  to  the  federal
Constitution after religion;  freedom of expression;  guns  and the  military;  and
protection  from  searches,  seizures,  and  warrants  is  constitutional  criminal
procedure.  These  subjects  are  addressed  in the  Fifth  and  Sixth Amendments,
and arguably  some  related subjects  are  addressed  in  Article  I, Sections  Nine

192.  232  U.S.  383,  398  (1914).
193.  367  U.S.  643,  655-59  (1961).

or  required  to  search  suspected  places,  or  to  seize  any  person['s]  property,  not  particularly
described, are contrary  to that right,  and ought not to  be granted.").

Individual Rights  Under State  Constitutions  in  1868

and  Ten  of  the  federal  Constitution.  We  will  therefore  now  look  at  the
criminal-procedure  rights protected  by state  constitutions  in  1868.

1.  Double Jeopardy.-The federal  Constitution  protects  against  double
jeopardy,  but  the  Supreme  Court  famously  failed  to  incorporate  this  right
against  the  states  in  Palko v.  Connecticut, 97  where  it  said  such  protection
was  not  implicit  in  the  concept  of ordered  liberty.198  It  turns  out,  however,
that  in  1868  fully  thirty-one  states--or  over  three-quarters  of the  total-had
clauses  in  their  state  constitutions  that  provided that  no  person  could  be  put
in jeopardy  twice  for  the  same  offense.  Typically  these  clauses  stated,  "No
person's  life  or  liberty  shall  be  twice  placed  in  jeopardy  for  the  same
offence."' 99   Thus,  it  would  appear,  contrary  to  Palko, that  there  was  an
Article  V  consensus  for constitutional  protection  against  double jeopardy  in
1868  as a right that was  implicit in ordered  liberty.  Palko was  overruled  and
the  Fourteenth  Amendment  was  held  to  bar  double  jeopardy  in  Benton  v.
Maryland.200  Looking  at matters by population,  86%  of the  American  people
in  1868  lived  in  states  where  double  jeopardy  was  unconstitutional.  All
Midwestern-Western 
state  constitutions  had  clauses  banning  double
jeopardy,  compared  to  80%  of  Southern  and  70%  of Northeastern  states.
Bans  on double jeopardy appeared  with the  same  frequency  in  state  constitu-
tions that were adopted before  and after  1855.

2.  Habeas  Corpus.-The  federal  Constitution  provides  a  criminal-
procedure  right  in  Article  I,  Section  Nine  that  forbids  Congress  from
suspending  the  writ  of habeas  corpus,  thus prohibiting  the  detention  of indi-
viduals  without trial,  except  in cases  of invasion or armed rebellion. 20 1  There
was a comparable  consensus  opposing suspension  of the  Great Writ in  thirty-
six states  in  1868,  making an  Article V,  three-quarters  consensus.  In most  of
the  habeas  clauses,  an  exception  was  granted  for  cases  of  rebellion  or
invasion.  Delaware's  constitution,  for example,  stated,  "The  privilege  of the
writ of habeas corpus shall  not  be  suspended  unless  when in  cases  of rebel-
lion or  invasion  the  public  safety  may  require  it.''2°2  Looking  at matters  by
population,  96%  of the  American  people  in  1868  lived  in  states  whose  con-
stitutions  guaranteed  the  availability  of  the  Great  Writ.  The  only  state

201.  Note  that although  Article  I,  Section Nine  ultimately  limits Congress's  powers  with regard
to habeas corpus,  its scope and  availability  is largely  determined  by statute.  See 28  U.S.C.  §§  2254-
2255  (2000)  (providing  procedures  for  writs  of  habeas  corpus  for  persons  in  state  and  federal

3.  Self-incrimination. -The  Fifth  Amendment  to  the  federal  Bill  of
Rights  famously  guarantees  a right  in  federal  trials  to  be protected  from self-
incrimination.  However,  the  Supreme  Court-over  the  heated  dissent  of
Justice  Hugo  Black-declined  to  incorporate  that  right  in  Adamson  v.
California,2 0 3  concluding  protection 
self-incrimination  was  not
4  The  Supreme  Court  subsequently  overruled Adamson,2 °5  and
fundamental .
today  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  does  protect 
individuals  from  self-
incrimination  in  state  criminal  cases.  Our  historical  research  suggests  that
Justice  Black was  right  in Adamson  and  Justice  Felix  Frankfurter, who  wrote
the  majority,  was  wrong  at  least  as  to  whether  the  right  against  self-
incrimination  was  historically  fundamental.  Fully  thirty-four  of the  thirty-
seven states  in  1868--or  an Article V,  three-quarters  federal  consensus-had
explicit  language  in  their  state  constitutions  that  stated  that  no  criminal  de-
fendant  could be  compelled  to  be  a  witness  against  himself.  Typically,  state
self-incrimination  clauses  in  1868  provided,  "That  no man  ought  to  be  com-
pelled  to  give  evidence  against  himself in  a  criminal  case. 20 6  Ninety-one
percent  of the American  people  living  in  1868-a  huge supermajority-lived
in states  that had this  right.  The  right  against  self-incrimination  was  recog-
nized by 93%  of the Southern  state constitutions,  by 92%  of the Midwestern-
Western  state  constitutions,  and  by  90%  of the  Northeastern  state  constitu-
tions  in  1868.  Ninety-four percent  of the pre- 1855  and 89%  of the post- 1855
constitutions  protected  against  self-incrimination.

This  raises  an  interesting  question  as to how Justice  Frankfurter  could
have  failed  to  find  that  freedom  from  self-incrimination  was  a  fundamental,
unenumerated  right  under the  Fourteenth  Amendment.  The  answer  may be
that  Justice  Frankfurter,  who  was  born  in  Vienna,  Austria,  and  who  had  a
life-long  fascination  with  the  civil  law  legal  tradition  of continental  Europe,
may have been moved by the fact that France  and Germany  did not recognize
a  right against  self-incrimination. 
Accordingly,  he  might  not have  recog-
nized  such  a  right. 
Ironically,  if Justice  Frankfurter  had  known  as  much

about  American  history  as  he  knew  about  comparative  law  he  might  have
reached  a different conclusion  in the Adamson case.

4.  Right  to  Counsel.-Another  vitally  important  criminal-procedure
guarantee  is  the  right  to  counsel.  The  Supreme  Court  ruled  in  1932  in  the
infamous Scottsboro Boys  Case, Powell v. Alabama,20 8 that the  right to coun-
sel  in  capital  cases  was  implied  in  the  Bill  of  Rights  as  a  fundamental
freedom. 20 9   This  right  was  guaranteed 
in  one  of  two  ways  in  state
constitutions:  either explicitly,  or through  the  right to be  heard  by  oneself or
counsel.  As an  example  of the  latter, Illinois  guaranteed  that  "in all  criminal
prosecutions 
to  be  heard  by  himself  and
counsel  .. 210  One  of the  more  explicit rights,  guaranteed  in  Georgia,  for
example,  stated,  "Every  person  charged  with  an  offence  against  the  laws
shall have the privilege  and benefit  of counsel  .... 21

the  accused  hath  a  right 

Thirty-four  states-or a three-quarters  majority-guaranteed  a  right to
counsel  in one  of these  two  ways.  Looking  at the  matter by population,  91%
of Americans-a  huge  supermajority-lived  in  states  in  1868 that  guaranteed
a  right  to  counsel  in  some  form.  This  right  was  found 
in  100%  of
in  93%  of  Southern  state
Northeastern  state  constitutions 
constitutions,  and  in  83%  of Midwestern-Western  state  constitutions.  Rec-
ognition  of the  right  to  counsel  in  criminal  cases  could  be  found  in  89%  of
the pre-1855  constitutions  and  in 95%  of the post-1855  constitutions.

in  1868, 

accused  shall...  have 

the 

assistance  of  counsel 

Twelve  states  had  explicit rights to  counsel.  A  typical  such  clause  read:
for  his
"[T]he 
defence  ....  An additional  seventeen  states had rights to be  heard by self
and counsel,  which  strongly  suggests  a  right  to  counsel.  Typically,  these
clauses  provided,  "[I]n  all  criminal  prosecutions  the  accused  hath  a right  to
be  heard  by  himself  and  his  counsel  ....  Five  additional  states  had
somewhat  more  ambiguous  rights  to  be  heard  by  self or counsel,  providing,
for  example,  "[E]very  subject  shall  have  a right...  to  be  fully  heard  in  his
defence  by himself, or  his counsel  at his  election., 214  We read  all  three  types
of clauses  as  providing  the  right to  counsel  in  criminal  prosecutions,  but  we
have  described  them  separately  to  allow  for  alternative 
interpretations.

defendants  to have  counsel  in  felony trials.2 16

5. Speedy  Trial.-Another criminal-procedure  guarantee  of the  federal
Constitution  is  the right to  a  speedy trial.2 17  Twenty-nine  of the  thirty-seven
states  in  1868-or  a  three-quarters,  Article  V  consensus  of  the  states-
guaranteed  criminal  defendants  the  right  to a  speedy trial.  Often paired  with
the  right  to  a  public  trial,  a  typical  clause  guaranteeing  a right  to  a  speedy
trial  stated,  "In  all criminal  prosecutions  the  accused shall  enjoy the right  to  a
speedy  and public  ....,,218  A  huge  supermajority  of Americans  in  1868
fully  82%--lived  in  states  where  this  right  was  constitutionally  protected.  A
right to a  speedy trial was present  in 90%  of Northeastern  state  constitutions,
80%  of Southern  state  constitutions,  and  75%  of Midwestern-Western  state
constitutions.  A  constitutional right to  a speedy trial  was  found in  89%  of the
pre-1855  constitutions  and  74%  of the  post-1855  constitutions.  The  federal
right  was  incorporated  against  the  states  in  Klopfer  v.  North  Carolina in
1967.219

6.  Public Trial.-Another fundamental  criminal-procedure  right  is  the
right  to  a public  trial. 220  Twenty-four  states  out of thirty-seven-or  a major-
ity  but not an  Article V consensus-guaranteed  criminal  defendants  the  right
to  a public trial.  Often  paired with the  right  to a speedy trial,  a typical clause
guaranteeing  a right  to  a public  trial  stated,  "In  all  criminal prosecutions  the

population,  a solid majority of Americans  in  1868-58%-lived  in states that
protected  this right.  Protection  of the  right to  a public  trial  varied  widely by
geography.  The  right  could  be  found  in  1868  in  83%  of  Midwestern-
Western  state  constitutions,  in  60%  of  Southern  state  constitutions,  and  in
50%  of Northeastern  state  constitutions.  The  right  to  a public  trial  could  be
found  in  1868  in  67%  of  the  pre-1855  and  in  63%  of  the  post-1855
constitutions.  The  Sixth  Amendment right to  a public  trial was  applied to  the

Individual  Rights Under  State Constitutions  in  1868

7.  Confrontation.-Yet  another  criminal-procedure  guarantee  of  the
federal  Bill  of Rights  that  the  Supreme  Court,  led  by  Justices  Scalia  and
Thomas,  has  done  a  lot  to  resurrect  in  recent  years223  is  the  Confrontation
Clause.224  This  Clause  guarantees  criminal  defendants  the  right  to  confront
the  witnesses  against  them. 225  Thirty-two  out  of thirty-seven  state  constitu-
in  1868-or  an  Article  V,  three-quarters  consensus-contained
tions 
confrontation  clauses. 
Typically,  the  state  constitutional  confrontation
clauses  stated,  "In  all  criminal  prosecutions  the  accused  shall  have  a  right
to  ...  be  confronted  with  the  witnesses  against  him ....  ,,226  A  huge
supermajority  of  Americans-85%-lived 
in  states  with  confrontation
clauses  in  their  state  constitutions  in  1868.  Such  clauses  could  be  found  in
90%  of  Northeastern  state  constitutions, 
in  87%  of  Southern  state
constitutions,  and in  83%  of Midwestern-Western  state  constitutions.  There
was  not  much  variation  by  date,  with  confrontation  clauses  being  present  in
89%  of the  pre-1855  and 84%  of the  post-1855  constitutions.

Fifteen  states  explicitly  guaranteed  the  right  to  confront  witnesses  face-
to-face.  For  example,  Wisconsin's  constitution  provided,  "In  all  criminal
prosecutions,  the  accused  shall  enjoy  the  right..,  to meet  the  witnesses  face
to  face. 227  This variation  of the  confrontation  clauses  is important  because
Justices  Scalia  and  Thomas  have  argued  that  the  federal  Confrontation
Clause  requires  face-to-face  confrontation,  although  such  language  is  not
explicitly  used.228  The  federal  right  was  incorporated  against  the  states  in
Pointer v.  Texas in  1965.229

8.  Obtain  Witnesses.-Another  vital  criminal-procedure  right  is  the
right  to  have  compulsory  process  for  obtaining  witnesses  in  one's  favor.
This  right  is explicitly  protected by  the  Sixth Amendment  of the  federal  Bill
of Rights.  Unsurprisingly,  therefore,  a  substantial  majority  of twenty-seven
out  of  thirty-seven  states--or  over  two-thirds-guaranteed  criminal  defen-
dants  the  right  to  have  compulsory  process  for  obtaining  witnesses  in  their
favor.  Such  state  bill of rights provisions  typically provided,  "In  all  criminal

liberty  without  due  process  of  law  means  at  least  that  an  accused  cannot  be  thus  sentenced  to
prison.").

223.  See  Crawford  v.  Washington,  541  U.S.  36,  60  (2004)  (arguing  that  the  Confrontation
Clause  has  become  distorted  over  time  and  that  the  Court's  interpretation  should  return  to  its
original  meaning).

from  trial have  been admitted only  where  the  declarant  is unavailable  and only  where  the  defendant

prosecutions,  the  accused  shall  enjoy  the  right..,  to  have  compulsory  proc-
ess  to  compel  the  attendance  of witnesses  in  his  behalf .... 
,230  Looking  at
the prevalence  of this right  by population,  it turns  out that  73%  of Americans
in  1868-almost  three-quarters  of the  total population-lived  in states  where
this right  was  constitutionally  protected.  Geographically,  the  right  to  obtain
witnesses  was  present  in  83%  of Midwestern-Western  state  constitutions  in
1868,  in  73%  of  Southern  state  constitutions,  and  in  60%  of Northeastern
constitutions.  The  right to  compel  the attendance  of witnesses  on  one's own
behalf was  equally present  in older and more recent  state  constitutions.

9.  Informed  of  Charges.-The  federal  Bill  of  Rights  in  the  Sixth
Amendment  gives  the  accused  the  right  to  be  "informed  of the  nature  and
cause of the  accusation"  against  him.2 31  Once  again, state  bills of rights over-
whelmingly  protected  this  federal  criminal-procedure  right  in  1868  as  well.
Thirty-one  out  of  thirty-seven  states-or  over  three-quarters-guaranteed
criminal  defendants  the  right  to  be  informed  of the  charges  against  them.
This  is,  of course,  an Article  V consensus  of states  needed  for the  making  of
federal constitutional  law.  A typical  such clause  said,  "In  all criminal  prose-
cutions  the  accused  hath  a  right  to  ...  demand  the  nature  and  cause  of  the
accusation  against  him...  ,,232  Looking at the  question  by population,  82%
of Americans  living  in  1868  lived  in  states  where  this  right  was  protected.
Geographically,  the  right  was  found  in  90%  of Northeastern  constitutions,
83%  of  Midwestern-Western  constitutions,  and 
in  80%  of  Southern
constitutions.  Defendants'  right to be informed of the nature  and  cause  of the
accusations  against  them  was  present  in  89%  of the  pre-1855  constitutions
and in 79%  of the  post-1855  constitutions.  The  Sixth Amendment  right to  be
notified of charges  was incorporated  in  1948  in In re Oliver.233

10.  Other Miscellaneous Criminal Procedure Guarantees.-Our study
turned up  three  other miscellaneous  criminal-procedure  guarantees  in a hand-
ful  of state  constitutions  that  are  not  present  in  the  federal  Bill  of  Rights.
One  state,  North Carolina,  had a clause in  its  state  constitution that  provided,
"Every  person  restrained  of his  liberty  is entitled  to  a remedy  to  inquire  into
the  lawfulness  thereof, and to  remove  the  same if unlawful;  and such remedy
ought  not  to  be  denied  or  delayed., 234  This  could  be  read  to  guarantee  the
availability  of collateral  review  at  all  times,  although  it  may  just  guarantee
habeas  corpus.  Three  percent  of the  population  lived  in  North  Carolina  in
1868,  and its constitution  was  ratified after  1855.

Individual  Rights  Under  State Constitutions  in  1868

Another  state,  Rhode Island,  guaranteed  the presumption  of innocence
in  explicit  constitutional  language.  Rhode  Island's  bill  of rights  provided,
"Every  man  being  presumed  innocent  until  he  is  pronounced  guilty  by  the
law,  no  act  of severity  which  is  not  necessary  to  secure  an  accused  person

Island  in  1868,  and its constitution  was  ratified before  1855.

Finally, 

two  states  protected 

their  citizens  from  detention  or
punishment,  except  in  cases  clearly  warranted  by  law.236  These  clauses
appear  to  overlap  with  state  due  process  clauses  about  which  we  shall  have
more  to  say  below.  Four percent  of the  American  people lived  in  states  that
protected  this  right  in  1868.  These  states  were  in  the  Northeast  and  the
South, one  with a constitution before  1855  and one from after  1855.

F.  Due Process

Perhaps the most  consequential  clause of the  federal  Bill of Rights  is the
provision  in the Fifth  Amendment that  says, "No  person  shall be  ... deprived
of life,  liberty,  or  property  without  due  process  of law. 237  This  clause  was
the  only provision  of the federal  Bill  of Rights relied on by the U.S.  Supreme
Court to  strike  down  an act  of Congress  as  unconstitutional  prior  to the  Civil
War.238  In Dred Scott v.  Sandford,239  the  Court read substantive  content  into
the  Fifth  Amendment  Due  Process  Clause  and  concluded  that  a federal  stat-
ute  that  deprived  slave  owners  of their  "right"  to  bring  their  slaves  into
federal  territories  was  a  deprivation  of property  "without  due  process  of
law., 240  Critics  of substantive  due  process  responded  that  the  Due  Process
Clause  was  originally  meant  to  protect  against  only  arbitrary  and  capricious
executive  deprivations  of rights;  deprivations  pursuant  to  statute were  always
okay because  the  enactment  of a statute  was  all  the  process  that  was  due.241
This  argument  that  the  Due  Process  Clause  protects  only  against  arbitrary
and  capricious  executive  or judicial  action  and  not  against  arbitrary  and  ca-
pricious  statutes  is bolstered when  one  looks at the clause  in the Magna  Carta
from  which  the  federal  Due  Process  Clause  derives,  the  per legem  terrae

prescribed .. "); CONN.  CONST.  of  1818,  art.  I,  §  10  ("No  person  shall  be  arrested,  detained,  or

procedural-  or  the  substantive-due-process  understanding  of  the  Fifth  or
Fourteenth Amendment  federal Due  Process  Clauses.

Thirty  states  out of thirty-seven in  1868-or an  Article V, three-quarters
consensus-had  clauses  in  their  state  constitutions  that  explicitly  prohibited
the  deprivation  of life,  liberty,  or  property  without  due  process  of law  or by
the law  of the land.245  A typical  such  due process  clause,  in the  Georgia con-
stitution,  provided, "No  person  shall be  deprived  of life,  liberty,  or  property,
except  by due  process  of law., 2 46  Many  of the  thirty  states  with  due  process
clauses  in their  state  bills  of rights used the  old English  Magna  Carta  formu-
lation  that  deprivations  of life,  liberty,  or  property  were  not  allowed  except
"by  the  law  of  the  land. 247   A  typical  example  is  the  New  Hampshire
Constitution,  which  stated,  "[N]o  subject  shall  be  arrested,  imprisoned,
despoiled,  or  deprived  of his  property,  immunities,  or privileges,  put  out  of
the protection  of the  law,  exiled, or  deprived  of his  life,  liberty,  or estate  but
by  the judgment  of his peers  or the  law  of the land., 248  All in  all, eighteen  of
the thirty  states  with  due process  clauses  in  1868  used the  "by  the  law  of the
land"  language  while  fourteen  used  the  words  "due  process  of law."  Two
states-Minnesota  and  New  York-had  both  a  clause  with  "by  law  of the
land"  language 249  and  a  clause  with  "due  process  of law"  language. 250  This

Individual  Rights  Under State  Constitutions  in  1868

may  bolster the  notion that  the  two  formulations  did have  distinct meanings.
The  fact  that  so  many  states  in  1868  continued  to  use  the  "by  the  law  of the
land"  language  in  their  state  due  process  clauses  suggests  there  was  no
Article  V, three-quarters-of-the-states  consensus  that  due process  clauses  had
substantive  content.

Looking  at  the  issue  by  population,  82%  of Americans  in  1868-a

huge  supermajority-lived  in  states  with either due  process  or  "by the  law  of
the  land"  guarantees.  Thirty-five  percent  of  the  total  population  lived  in
states  with  due  process  clauses  and  60%--a  large  majority-lived  in  states
with  "by  the  law  of the  land"  clauses.  The prevalence  of due  process  or "by
the  law of the  land"  clauses  varied by region.  Such  clauses  were  to be found
in  100%  of Southern  state  constitutions,  90%  of Northeastern  constitutions,
and  only  50%  of Midwestern-Western  constitutions.  The  language  of due
process  was  used  in  47%  of  Southern  constitutions,  20%  of Northeastern
constitutions,  and  58%  of Midwestern-Western  constitutions.  The  "by  the
law  of  the  land"  language, 
in  contrast,  appeared  in  53%  of  Southern
constitutions,  80%  of Northeastern  constitutions,  and  16%  of Midwestern-
Western  constitutions.  Seventy-eight  percent  of the  pre-1855  constitutions
and  84%  of the  post-1855  constitutions  contained  either  the  due  process  or
the  "by  the  law  of the  land"  formulation.  The  "by  the  law  of the  land"  for-
mulation  was  more  common  in pre-1855  constitutions  while the  due  process
formulation  was 
the  post-1855  constitutions.
Specifically,  61%  of the "by  the  law  of the  land"  formulations  were  found  in
pre-1855  constitutions whereas  71%  of the  "due  process"  formulations  were
found  in  post-1855  constitutions.  The  trend,  as  the  majority  in  Roper  v.
Simmons 25  might  say,  was  toward  preferring  the  language  of  due  process
over  the  "by  the  law  of the  land"  formulation.252 
In  sum,  there  was  an
Article V  consensus  of  three-quarters  of  the  states  that  procedural  due
process  was  a  fundamental  right  in  1868,  but  there  was  no  such  Article  V
consensus  with  respect  to  substantive  due  process.  The  right  to  procedural
due  process  is thus an important  criminal and  civil right.  This may be of help
in  informing  the  meaning  of  the  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth
Amendment,  which  was  of course  adopted  as  part  of  the  Amendment  in
1868.  The  question  whether  this  Clause  has  a  substantive  component  has
vexed the Court for the last  140 years.

G.  Criminal and  Civil  Procedure  Rights  Borrowed from  the  Original

Constitution

We  have  now  looked  at  the  prevalence  in  state  constitutions  of  the
criminal-procedure  guarantees  that  appear  in the  federal  Bill of Rights.  This
does  not  end  our  criminal-procedure 
inquiry,  however,  because  Article I,
Sections  Nine  and  Ten  of the  federal  Constitution  also  guarantee  two  such
rights.  First, Congress  and the  states  are forbidden  from passing any  ex post
facto  laws  or bills  of attainder.253  In  addition,  the  states,  but  not  Congress,
are  barred  from  passing  any  laws  that  impair  the  obligation  of contracts.254
Impairments  of contracts  could  be  retroactive  civil  laws  of a  certain  type.
The  federal  Constitution  also  contains 
two  other  criminal-procedure
guarantees.  Article  III,  Section  Three  forbids  federal 
laws  that  work
corruption  of the  blood,  and  it  narrows  the  definition  of treason  in  federal
law.255  To  what  extent,  then,  did state  bills  of rights  in  1868  protect  any  or
all of these rights?

1.  Ex  Post Facto Laws.-An  ex  post  facto  law  is  one  that  criminally
punishes  an  act  that  was  legally  permissible  when  it  was  done.256  The
Supreme  Court  initially  considered  and  developed  a  test  for  the  Ex  Post
Facto  Clause  in  Calder v.  Bull  in  1798.57  Unsurprisingly,  our  nose  count
revealed that  twenty-nine out of thirty-seven  states-or over three-quarters-
prohibited  ex  post  facto  laws.  The  clauses  typically  provided,  "No  ex  post
facto  law,  nor  any  law  impairing  the  obligation  of contracts,  shall  ever  be
made  ... ,,258  Ex  post  facto  clauses  were  usually  coupled  with  clauses  ad-
dressing  obligations  of contracts,  corruption  of blood, bills  of attainder, or  a
combination  of the three.  About  73%  of the population  in  1868-or slightly
less  than  three-fourths-lived  in  states  with  bans  on  ex post  facto  laws.  Ex
post facto  law  clauses  were  found  in  87%  of Southern  state  constitutions,  in
83%  of Midwestern-Western  state  constitutions,  and in 60%  of Northeastern
state  constitutions.  They  were  present  in  72%  of the  pre-1855  and  84%  of
the post-1855  state  constitutions.  These  state  constitutional  clauses  were,  of
course,  superfluous  because Article  I, Section Ten  of the  federal  Constitution
already  forbade  the states  from enacting  ex post facto  laws.259

2.  Retroactive Civil Laws.-Also  in  Calder v.  Bull, the  U.S.  Supreme
Court  famously  ruled  that  the  federal  Ex  Post Facto  Clause  applied  only  to

retroactive  criminal  laws  and  not  to  retroactive  civil  laws.2 60  Retroactive
civil  laws  thus  are  not  prevented  by the  Ex  Post Facto  Clause,  although  they
can be  challenged  under  the  Due  Process  Clause.2 6' 
It  is  interesting  in  this
respect that  only  a  small minority of four  states  had  clauses in  their state  con-
stitutions in  1868  that  explicitly prohibited retroactive  (or  retrospective)  civil
laws.  A typical  such  clause  said,  "No bill  of attainder,  ex post facto law,  ret-
roactive  law,  or  any  law  impairing  the  obligation  of  contracts,  shall  be
made., 262  Thirteen  percent  of  the  population  lived  in  these  states,  all  of
which were  in  the  South.  The  constitutions  of these  states  constituted  6%  of
the  pre-1855  constitutions  and  16%  of  the  post-1855  constitutions.  63  All
four  of the  state  constitutions  here  were  ratified  after  Calder v.  Bull was  de-
cided.  Justice  Clarence  Thomas  has  urged  the  Court  to  reconsider  Calder
and extend  ex post facto protection to  civil laws. 26

3.  Bills of Attainder. -Article 

I,  Sections Nine  and  Ten  of the  federal
Constitution  prohibit  federal  and  state  governments  from  adopting  bills  of
attainder, which  are  laws  that direct  the  punishment  of a  particular  person or
group  of people.265  The  Supreme  Court  has  stated  that  "the  Bill  of Attainder
Clause  was  intended  not as  a  narrow,  technical...  prohibition,  but rather  as
an  implementation  of the  separation  of powers,  a  general  safeguard  against
legislative  exercise  of  the  judicial  function. ''266   Only  twenty-two  out  of
thirty-seven  states-a  simple  majority-prohibited  bills  of attainder  in  their
state  bills of rights  even  though  the  federal  Constitution  already  forbade  the
states  from  enacting  them.  Of course,  many  states  may  have  thought  such
prohibitions  unnecessary  in  light of the  federal  constitutional  proscription  of
bills of attainder.  A  typical  state  constitutional bill-of-attainder  clause  stated,
"No  bill  of attainder,  ex post facto law,  or law  impairing  the  obligation  of a
contract  shall  be  passed., 267  Fifty-three  percent  of Americans  in  1868  lived
in  states with  this right  in their  state  constitution.  Protection  of the  right was
fairly  evenly  distributed  across  the  country,  with  the  prohibition  on  bills  of
attainder  being  found  in  67%  of  Southern  state  constitutions,  58%  of
Midwestern-Western  state  constitutions,  and  50%  of  Northeastern  state

constitutions.  Forty-four  percent of the  pre- 1855  state  constitutions  and  74%
of the post- 1855  constitutions  forbade  bills of attainder.

4.  Corruption of Blood.-The federal  Constitution  forbids  federal  but
not state  laws  that work  corruption of the  blood.268  A typical  such  law  would
apply  criminal  penalties  or  fines  against  not  only  those  convicted  of crimes
but  also  against  their  descendants. 269  Twenty  states  out  of  thirty-seven  in
1868-a  majority but not an  Article V,  three-quarters  consensus-had  provi-
sions 
in  their  state  bills  of  rights  that  prohibited  convictions  working
corruption  of blood.  A  typical  such  clause  provided,  "No  conviction  shall
work  corruption  of  blood  or  forfeiture  of  estate., 270   These  clauses  ban
corruption  of  the  blood  only  from  convictions  and  not  because  one's
ancestors  were,  for example,  potentially  slave  owners.  Sixty  percent  of the
American  people  in  1868  lived  in  states  with  clauses  in  their  state  constitu-
tions  that  forbade  convictions  from  working  corruption  of the  blood.  Such
clauses  could  be  found  in  67%  of Midwestern-Western  state  constitutions,
60%  of  Southern  state  constitutions,  and  30%  of  Northeastern  state
constitutions.  Fifty  percent  of  the  pre-1855  and  58%  of  the  post-1855
constitutions prohibited  convictions  from working corruption  of the blood.

5.  Impairment  of  Contracts.-The  federal  Constitution  forbids 

the
states  from  passing  laws  impairing  the  obligation  of contracts,  and twenty-
five  out  of thirty-seven  states  in  1868-or just  over  two-thirds-concurred
and prohibited  laws  impairing  the obligation  of contracts  in their state  bills of
rights.  A typical  clause  of this type  provided,  "No  ex post facto law,  or law
impairing  the  obligation  of  contracts,  shall  be  passed." '271 
Sixty-three
percent-or  just  under  two-thirds-of  the  total  population  in  1868  lived  in
states  with  constitutions  that  forbade  laws  impairing  the  obligation  of
contracts.  Contract  clauses  were  present  in  83%  of  Midwestern-Western
state  constitutions,  in  73%  of  Southern  state  constitutions,  and  in  40%  of
Northeastern  state  constitutions.  Contract  clauses  could  be  found  in  61%  of
the pre- 1855  and in 74%  of the post- 1855  constitutions.

6.  Treason.-The federal  Constitution  limits  the definition  of treason  in
federal  cases,272  and  state  constitutions 
in  1868  largely  followed  suit.
Twenty-seven  states-or  over  two-thirds-limited  the  definition  of treason.

Act, or on Confession  in open  Court.").

Individual  Rights Under  State Constitutions  in  1868

Sixty-two  percent-slightly  less  than  two-thirds--of  the  total  population  in
1868  lived  in  states  where  the  definition  of treason  was  limited.  The  defini-
tion  of treason  was  limited  in  83%  of Midwestern-Westem  constitutions,  in
73%  of Southern  constitutions,  and  in  60%  of Northeastern  state  constitu-
tions  in  1868.  Narrowed  definitions  of treason  were  less  common  in  pre-
1855  state  constitutions,  of which  only 61%  had  such  clauses, as  compared  to
84%  of the post-1855  state  constitutions.  These  clauses  typically  established
that  treason  could  consist  only  of levying  war  against  the  state,  adhering  to
its  enemies,  or  giving  them  aid  and  comfort. 
For  example,  Arkansas
provided, "Treason  against  the  State  shall  only consist  in levying  war against
the  same,  or  in  adhering  to  its  enemies,  giving  them  aid  and  comfort.  No
person shall  be convicted  of treason unless  on the  testimony of two  witnesses
to  the  same  overt  act,  or  on  confession  in  open  court. 27 3  Like  Arkansas,
most  states  provided  that no  person be  convicted of treason  unless  on the  tes-
timony of two witnesses  to the  same  overt act, or confession  in open court.

H. Property Rights

The  federal  Bill  of Rights  starts  by  protecting  religious  freedom;  it
then protects  freedom  of expression,  then  guns  and  the  military,  then  unrea-
sonable  searches,  and  then  criminal  procedure.  The  next  major  topic
addressed by the federal  Bill of Rights,  a topic  addressed  in the middle  of the
criminal-procedure  sections,  is  property  rights.275  Specifically,  the  Takings
Clause  of the  Fifth  Amendment  provides  that  private  property  shall  not  be
taken  for public  use  without  just  compensation  being  paid.276  Many  ques-
tions  have  arisen  about  this  language.  Are  takings  for  private  use  ever
allowed? 277  Are regulations  that  impair the  value  of property  also  takings, or
are  only  physical  invasions  takings? 278   How  is  just  compensation  to  be
determined? 279  Ironically,  although  the  Takings  Clause  appears  only  in  the
middle  of the Bill of Rights,  it was the  first Clause  to be incorporated  into  the

value  of property  do not amount  to takings).

government power of eminent  domain.  Thirty-three  states  out of thirty-seven
in  1868  had takings  clauses  in their  constitutions.  This  is easily  an  Article V
consensus  of the  states  for the  making of federal  constitutional  law.  A typi-
cal  takings  clause  in  a  state  constitution  at  this  time  provided,  "Private
property  shall  not  be  taken  for  public  uses  without  just  compensation
therefor. ' '281  Ninety-one  percent  of  the  American  people  in  1868-a  huge

constitutions, in  92%  of Midwestern-Western  state  constitutions,  and in 80%
of Southern  state  constitutions.  Takings  clauses were  notably more  common
in older  state  constitutions,  and  they could be found  in  100%  of the pre-1855
constitutions  and  in 79%  of the post-1855  constitutions.  Alabama  and South
Carolina's  clauses  also  specifically  prohibited  transfers  for  private  use,282

course,  the  other  states  may just have  assumed  that  it was  obvious  that  tak-
ings  for  private  use  were  forbidden  and  that  there  was  no  need  to  state  it
explicitly.  Alternatively,  one  could  read  something  portentous  into  the  fail-
ure  of these  states  to  ban takings  for private  use.  New  Hampshire's  takings
clause  is  slightly  different  from  the  others  in  that  it  does  not  require  just
compensation.284  One  other  state  constitution,  that  of Georgia,  contains  a
related  clause  that  provides,  "Private  ways  may  be  granted  upon  just  com-
pensation  being paid by the applicant.' 285

Individual  Rights Under  State Constitutions  in  1868

2.  Monopolies.-Another question that  arose  early  in  the  history  of the
Fourteenth  Amendment  was  whether 
the  Amendment  conferred  on
individuals  a  fundamental  right  to  be  free  of  having  to  compete  with
monopolies  or the right  to practice  their professions without  permission  from
the  state.  The  U.S.  Supreme  Court famously  addressed  these  questions  in its
five-to-four  decision  in  1873  in  The Slaughterhouse Cases.2 86  A majority  of
the  Court, over  some  very  spirited  dissents, found  no  fundamental  right to  be
free  of monopolies  or  to  practice  one's profession  without  government  per-
mission  in  the  Fourteenth  Amendment.28 7 
(In  fact,  the  Slaughterhouse
majority  construed  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  in  an  absurdly  narrow  way,
which has been roundly excoriated  by courts  and  scholars.) 288

What,  then,  did  state  constitutional 

law  say  about  these  types  of
economic  freedoms  in  1868?  It  turns  out  that  only  five  states  out  of thirty-
seven  in  1868-a  small  minority-banned  monopolies  for  being  contrary  to
the  spirit  of a free  state.  Although  all  worded  their  state  constitutional  guar-
antees slightly  differently, they generally  declared,  "[M]onopolies  are odious,
contrary  to  the  spirit  of a  free  government  and  the  principles  of commerce,
and ought  not  to  be  suffered. 289  Only  13%  of Americans  in  1868  lived  in
states that  banned  monopolies  in  their  state  bills  of rights.  No  Midwestern-
Western  states  banned  monopolies,  but  antimonopoly  clauses  were  found  in
27%  of Southern  and  10%  of Northeastern  states.  They were  present  in  11%
of the  pre-1855  constitutions  and  16%  of  the  post-1855  constitutions.  The
Slaughterhouse  Court  was,  in  our  view,  profoundly  misguided  in  many
respects, 290  but  the  Court's  conclusion  that  there  was  no  fundamental,
positive-law  right  to be  free  of monopolies  in  1868  looks  to  have been  a  cor-
rect  statement  of the positive  law  at that  time.

3.  Legal Recourse.-No state  in  1868  specifically  addressed  regulatory
takings  of property,  but  state  constitutions  did  overwhelmingly  provide  a

discrimination  against the  negroes  as  a  class,  or on account  of their race,  will ever  be  held  to come

288.  See  CHARLES  L.  BLACK,  JR.,  A  NEW  BIRTH  OF  FREEDOM  55  (1999)  (stating  that  the

by  the  Supreme  Court");  Michael  Anthony  Lawrence,  Second Amendment  Incorporation Through

bound to follow.").

that the  Privileges  or  Immunities  Clause  was  "gutted"  by  Slaughterhouse, but  explaining  that  this
does not  impact the Clause's meaning  for a "good  originalist like  [him]").

right of legal  recourse  for injuries,  a  right  for which the  federal  Constitution
or  Bill of Rights  provides  no  analog.  Thus,  an  astonishing  twenty-eight  out
of thirty-seven  states  in  1868,  or  an  Article  V,  three-quarters  consensus,
guaranteed  their  citizens  the  right  to  legal  recourse  for  all  injuries  done  to
their  land, goods,  person,  or reputation.  This  could  be  argued to  support  the
Supreme  Court's  holding 
there  exists  some  kind  of  a
"fundamental  constitutional  right  of access  to  the  courts.",29 1  However,  this
right  has  only  been  examined  at  the  federal  level  through  narrow  holdings
involving  the  right  to appeal,292  challenges  to  filing  fee requirements,293  and
prisoners'  access to the  Judiciary.294

in  1977  that 

A  typical  state  clause  provided,  "All  courts  shall  be  open,  and  every
person,  for an  injury  done him in  his land,  goods,  person, or reputation,  shall
have remedy by due  course of law,  and justice  administered without  denial  or
delay., 295  This  fundamental  right  effectuated  the  famous  dictum  in Marbury
v. Madison296 where  the Court quoted  the English  law principle  that for every
right there  must be  a remedy.297  This  could even be  argued to imply the exis-
tence of Bivens298-like causes of action  where the  legislature has not provided
for them. 299

Seventy-three  percent  of  all  Americans  in  1868-slightly  less  than
three-fourths-lived  in  states  that  had  provisions  of this  sort  in  their  state
constitutions.  A  right  to  legal  recourse  could  be  found 
in  80%  of
Northeastern  state  constitutions, 
in  75%  of  Midwestern-Western  state
constitutions,  and  in  73%  of Southern  state  constitutions.  A  right  to  legal
recourse  was  slightly  more  common  in  older  constitutions,  where  it could  be
found  in  83%  of those  state  constitutions  ratified  before  1855  but  in  only
68%  of those ratified  after  1855.

Individual Rights  Under  State Constitutions  in  1868

4.  Suits Against the State.-Five states  out  of thirty-seven  in  1868-a

small  minority-specifically  provided  in  their state  constitutions,  "Suits  may
be  brought  against  the  State,  according  to  such regulations  as  shall  be  made
by  law.,' 300   Thus,  thirty-two  states--or  more  than  three-quarters  of  the
states-made  no  provision  for  such  suits. 
Seventeen  percent  of  all
Americans  living  in  1868  lived in  states  that  had this  right.  The  right  could
be  found in 20%  of both Northeastern  and Southern  state  constitutions, but in
no Midwestern-Western  state  constitutions  at all.  A state  constitutional  right
to  sue the state  was  present  in only  17%  of the pre-1855  and  11%  of the  post-
1855  constitutions. 
It  would  thus  seem  that  there  was  no  widely  accepted
fundamental  right in  1868  to  sue the state.

5.  Property Escheat.-Another  small  minority  of  six  states  out  of
thirty-seven  declared  that  the  people  possess  the  ultimate  right  to  property
within  the  state.  A typical  clause  of this  kind provided,  "The  people  of this
State,  in  their  right  of  sovereignty,  are  deemed  to  possess  the  original  and
ultimate  property  in  and  to  all  lands  within  the jurisdiction  of the  State;  and
all  lands  the  title  to  which  shall  fail,  from  a  defect  of heirs,  shall  revert  or
escheat to  the people., 30 1  Twenty-two  percent of Americans  in  1868  lived in
states  with  provisions  like  this  in  their  state  constitutions.  Such  provisions
could  be  found 
of
Midwestern-Western  state  constitutions,  and  in  10%  of  Northeastern  state
constitutions.  Property  escheat  was  equally  common  in  more  recent  and
older constitutions.

in  20%  of  Southern  state  constitutions, 

in  17% 

6.  Married  Women.-Another  small  minority  of  five  states  out  of
thirty-seven  in  1868-less than  one-quarter-specifically  protected  the rights
of women  to  have  property  separate  from  their  husbands.  A  typical  state
constitutional  clause  protecting  the  property  of married  women  at  this  time
provided,  "The  legislature  shall  provide  for  the  protection  of  the  rights  of
women  in  acquiring  and  possessing  property,  real,  personal,  and  mixed,
separate  and  apart  from  the  husband;  and  shall  also  provide  for  their  equal
rights in  the  possession  of their  children. 30 2  Eight percent  of Americans  in

estates  of those  who  destroy  their  own  lives  shall  descend  or  vest  as  in  case
of natural  death  ...  .,,305  Twenty-two percent  of Americans  in  1868  lived  in
states  with  such  clauses  in  their  state  constitutions.  Suicide  clauses  were
found  in  30%  of Northeastern  and  20%  of  Southern  state  constitutions  in
1868.  They  were  not  found  in  any  Midwestern-Western  state  constitutions.
These  clauses  were  more  common  in older  than in  newer  state  constitutions;
they  could  be  found  in  28%  of the  pre-1855  constitutions  but  in  only  5% of
the post- 1855 constitutions.

I.  Juries and Grand Juries

The  federal  Bill  of Rights  guarantees  the  right to  criminal jury  trial  in
the  Sixth  Amendment,  as  does  Article  III,  Section  Two  of the  Constitution.
The  Seventh  Amendment  guarantees  the  right to  a  civil jury trial  in  all  suits
at common  law  for more  than $20.  These  provisions  are foundational  to fed-
eral  constitutional  law,  but  they  are  mentioned  only  after  the  topics  of:
religion;  expression;  guns  and  the  military;  searches  and  warrants;  criminal
procedure;  and property rights.  The right  to a jury  trial  in criminal  cases  was
incorporated  as  a  matter  of substantive  due  process  in  1968  in  Duncan v.
Louisiana,30 6  but the  Seventh  Amendment  right to a civil jury has  never been
incorporated.  The  Fifth  Amendment  of the  federal  Bill  of Rights  forbids  in-
dictment  in ordinary  cases  except where  a grand jury has voted out  a true bill.
What,  then,  did  state  constitutions  say  in  1868  about  whether  there  was  a
fundamental  right  to a criminal jury  trial, to  a civil jury trial,  or to be  indicted
only  with the concurrence  of a grand jury?

1.  Criminal Jury.-Thirty-six  states  out of thirty-seven  in  1868-a  clear
Article  V,  three-quarters  consensus-explicitly  guaranteed  the  right  to  jury
trials  in  all  criminal  prosecutions.  A typical  state  constitutional  clause of this
type  provided,  "In  all  criminal  prosecutions  the  accused  shall  have  a right  to

a speedy and public  trial  by an impartial jury ....  ,,307  Ninety-nine  percent of
all Americans  in  1868  lived in states  that constitutionally  guaranteed the  right
to  criminal  jury  trial.  Only  one  Midwestem-Western  state-California-
failed to  guarantee  the  right to  a criminal jury  trial,  and  its  constitution  was
ratified  before  1855.  One  state  of the  thirty-six  that  protected  the  right  to  a
criminal jury  trial-Vermont-also  required  unanimous  consent  of the jury
for convictions.3 °8  This  might be  relevant  since  modem  law  has  come  to al-
low non-unanimous jury  verdicts even  though they were not commonplace  in
1868.

2.  Civil Jury. -Thirty-six 

states  out  of thirty-seven  in  1868-another
clear  Article V,  three-quarters  consensus-guaranteed  the  right  to jury  trials
in  all  civil  or  common  law  cases.  Eighteen  of  these  states  explicitly  men-
tioned  a right  to  civil jury  trial  in  all  civil  or  common  law  trials.  Oregon's
constitution, for instance, provided, "In  all civil  cases the  right of trial by jury
shall remain  inviolate., 30 9  The  other eighteen  states provided  more generally
for the  right  by protecting  the  right  of a jury  trial  in the  abstract  without  spe-
cifically  singling out  civil  or criminal jury  trials  for protection.  For example,
the  Rhode  Island  constitution  provided,  "The  right  of trial  by jury  shall  re-
main  inviolate. 310  We  think  these  general  protections  of the  right to  jury
trial,  against  an  English  common  law  backdrop  where  civil  jury  trial  was
available  for  suits  at  common  law, probably  imply  that  these  state  constitu-
tions  ought to  be read as protecting  the  fight to  a civil jury trial,  although the
question  is  not  free  from  doubt.  The  lone  state  that  was  clearly  without  a
right  to  civil jury trial  in  1868  was  the  Southern  state  of Louisiana,  and  its
constitution  was  ratified after  1855.  This is striking  because  Louisiana is the
only  state  in  the  Union  with  a  tie  to  the  civil  law,  rather  than  the  common
law,  tradition. 311  A  key  difference  between  these  traditions  is  that  the  civil
law  does  not rely on jury  trials.312  Fully 98%  of all  Americans  in  1868  lived
in jurisdictions  where they had a  fundamental  state  constitutional  right to jury
trial  in all  civil or common  law cases.

307.  E.g.,  N.J. CONST.  of 1844, art.  I, § 8.
308.  VT.  CONST.  of 1793,  ch.  I,  art. X  ("[A]  person hath  a right  to ...  a speedy  public  trial  by

guilty  ...  ").

the 

[it] 

largely  sub-constitutional 

This  is  a  striking  finding  that  suggests  the  Supreme  Court's  failure  to
incorporate  the  Seventh  Amendment,31 3  when  it has  incorporated  almost  all
of the rest  of the  Bill  of Rights,  is  quite  odd  and  perhaps  mistaken.  It  might
be  suggested  that  this  anomaly  conforms  with  a  tendency  of the  Supreme
Court to  "exile"  the  Seventh  Amendment  from traditional  constitutional  law
inquiry  of  civil
and  "relegat[e] 
procedure. 314  Admittedly,  one  could argue that  only eighteen  states  in  1868
explicitly  single  out  civil jury  trial  as  a  fundamental  right,  but we  think  that
would  probably  misread  the  state  constitutional  provisions  that  protect  the
right to  a jury  trial  in  general.  We think  those  clauses  were  more  likely  un-
derstood  as  protecting  the  right  to  jury  trial  in  civil  as  well  as  in  criminal
cases.  This  is  confirmed  by  examination  of Noah  Webster's  authoritative
1828  American Dictionary of the English Language-a dictionary  that  many
in  1868  might  have  consulted.  Webster  defines  petty juries  as  usually  con-
sisting  "of twelve  men"  who  "attend  courts  to  try  matters  of fact  in  civil
causes,  and to  decide  both  the  law  and the  fact  in  criminal  prosecutions.'3 15
The  original  public  meaning  of a  clause  generally  protecting  the  right  to  a
jury trial would thus  most likely have been understood  in  1868  as  applying to
civil  as well as  criminal juries.

3.  Grand Jury.-The Fifth  Amendment  in  the  federal  Bill  of Rights
guarantees  that, in nonmilitary  cases,  "[n]o  person  shall be  held to  answer  for
a capital,  or otherwise infamous  crime, unless  on a presentment  or indictment
of a  Grand  Jury. 316  The  right  to a grand jury is thus  a fundamental  right un-
der federal  constitutional  law.  Nonetheless,  it is not  one of the  rights that the
Supreme  Court  has  said  is  incorporated  to  apply  against  the  states  by  the
Fourteenth  Amendment.31 7  What,  then, was  the status  of the right  to  a  grand
jury in state  constitutional  law in  1868?

It turns  out that  only nineteen  states out  of thirty-seven in  1868-a  bare
majority-guaranteed  the  right  to  presentment  or  indictment  by  a grand jury
for  felonies  (or  capital  and  other  infamous  crimes).  A  typical  clause  pro-
tecting this right provided:

313.  See  Curtis  v. Loether,  415  U.S.  189,  192  n.6  (1974)  (stating  that,  by  1974,  the  Court  had
"not  held  that  the  right  to jury  trial  in  civil  cases  is  an  element  of due  process  applicable  to state
courts  through  the  Fourteenth  Amendment").  To  date,  the  Supreme  Court  has  not decided  a  case
holding  otherwise.

Individual  Rights Under  State Constitutions  in  1868

No  person  shall  be  held  to  answer  a  criminal  offence  unless  on  the
presentment  or  indictment  of  a  grand  jury,  except  in  cases  of
impeachment,  or in  cases  of petit  larceny,  assault,  assault  and battery,
affray,  vagrancy  and  such  other  minor cases  as  the  general  assembly
shall  make  cognizable  by justices of the  peace;  or  arising in the  Army
and  Navy  of the United  States,  or  in  the  militia when  in actual  service
in  time of war or public  danger  .... 318

Thus,  there  was  no  Article  V  consensus  of three-quarters  of the  states,  nor
was  there  a  two-thirds  majority  of the  states  protecting  the  right to  a  grand
jury.  This  could be  argued  to  weigh  in favor of the non-incorporation  of the
grand jury requirement.

Looking  at the  issue  by  population,  it turns  out that  51%  of Americans
in  1868-again  a bare  majority-lived  in  states  that  guaranteed  the right  to  a
grand jury  indictment.  Geographically,  the  right to a grand jury was found in
58%  of  the  Midwestern-Western  state  constitutions  in  1868,  in  50%  of
Northeastern  state  constitutions,  and  in  47%  of Southern  state  constitutions.
It  was present  in  50% of the  pre-1855  constitutions  and  53%  of the post-1855
constitutions.  One  additional  state,  North  Carolina,  stated  that prosecutions
must  be  by  indictment,  presentment,  or  impeachment  but  did  not  mention
grand juries  by  name. 31 9  In  addition,  one  state's  constitution-Indiana's-
explicitly denied that there was  a  right to  a grand jury  in its state. 32

4.  By Information.-A small  minority  of seven  states out of thirty-seven
in  1868  protected  criminal  defendants  from  being prosecuted  by  information
(except  in  military  or  militia cases).  This  prohibits  the  initiation  of criminal
the  King,  a
prosecutions  based  solely  on 
government,  or  a  private  citizen-for  fear  that  such  prosecutions  could  be
politically  or maliciously  motivated. 321  The  alternative  to prosecution  by  in-
formation  is  prosecution  upon  indictment  by  a  grand jury.  A  typical  clause
of  this  kind  provided,  "No  person  shall  for  any  indictable  offence  be  pro-
ceeded  against  criminally  by  information,  except  in  cases  arising  in  the  land
and  naval  forces,  or  in  the  militia  when  in  actual  service  in  time  of war  or
public  danger  .... ,322 
Twenty-six  percent  of  Americans  lived  in  states
where  this  protection  was  a  part  of  state  bill-of-rights  constitutional  law.
Such a  right was  found  in 33%  of Southern  state constitutions  in  1868  and  in
20%  of  Northeastern  state  constitutions  at  that  time.  No  Midwestern-
Western  state had  such  a  right.  Twenty-two percent  of the pre-1855  and  16%

[Vol.  87:7

of the  post-1855  constitutions  recognized  this  right.  In  contrast,  two  state
constitutions-those  of Texas  and  of Louisiana--explicitly  permitted prose-
cution by information.323

5.  Martial Law.-Nine states-a  fairly  large  minority-protected  their
civilians  from  being  subjected  to  martial  law  in  times  of peace.  A  typical
clause  in  this  category  provided,  "[N]o  person  except  regular  soldiers  and
marines,  and  mariners  in  the  service  of this  State,  or  militia,  when  in  actual
service,  ought,  in  any case,  to  be  subject  to  or punishable  by martial  law., 324
Seventeen  percent  of  Americans  lived  in  states  with  clauses  of this  kind.
Such  clauses  could  be  found  in  50%  of Northeastern  state  constitutions,  in
20%  of Southern constitutions,  and in  only  8% of Midwestem-Western  state
constitutions.  This  right  was protected  in  39%  of the  pre-1855  constitutions
but in  only  11%  of the post-1855  constitutions.  One  of the  states whose  con-
stitution  protected  this  right,  Rhode  Island,  provided  a  significantly  weaker
protection than  the others.325

6.  Trial Within  the State.-The Sixth  Amendment  to the  federal  Bill  of
Rights  guarantees  a  right to  a criminal  jury  trial  "by  an  impartial jury  of the
State  and  district  wherein  the  crime  shall  have  been  committed,  which  dis-
trict shall  have  been  previously  ascertained  by  law  ....  Eight  states  out
of thirty-seven  in  1868  to  some  degree  echoed  this  requirement  of federal
law by guaranteeing  the  right  to  a trial  within  the  state  (or  county)  for crimi-
nal  prosecutions.  A typical  clause  of this  kind  stated,  "[N]o  person  shall  be
liable to be  transported out of this State  for any offence  committed  within the
same.' 327  Twenty-one  percent  of Americans  living  in  1868  lived  in  states
with  such  clauses  in  their  state  constitutions.  These  clauses  were  found  in
50%  of Northeastern  state  constitutions  and  in 25%  of Midwestern-Western
state  constitutions,  but not  in  any  Southern  state  constitutions  in  1868.  This
right was protected  in 39%  of the  pre-1855  state  constitutions  but in only  5%
of the  post- 1855  state constitutions.

7.  Impartial  Judge.-Two 

states-a  tiny  minority-explicitly
guaranteed  all  citizens  the  right  to  be  tried  by  impartial judges.  Of course,
such  a  right  could  be  argued  to  be  inherent  in  the  due  process  clauses  that

323.  See  LA.  CONST.  of  1868, 

tit.  I,  art.  6  ("Prosecutions  shall  be  by  indictment  or
information.");  TEX.  CONST.  of  1868,  art. I, § 8  ("And  no  person  shall be  holden  to answer for  any
criminal charge  but on  indictment or  information, except  in cases arising  in the  land or  naval  forces,
or offences against  the laws  regulating  the militia.").

Individual  Rights Under  State Constitutions  in  1868

most  states  already  had.  The  Massachusetts  constitution,  for  example,
provided  for an  impartial judge  by  saying,  "It  is  the  right of every citizen  to
be  tried  by judges  as free,  impartial,  and  independent  as  the  lot  of humanity
will  admit. 3 28  Five  percent  of Americans  lived  in  the  two  states  that  had
such  clauses.  Both  of these  states  were  in  the  Northeast  and both  had  con-
stitutions ratified  before  1855.

8.  Jury  Determines  Law  and  Fact.-Three  states-another  small
minority-had  clauses  in their  constitutions  in  1868  that  explicitly  provided,
"In  all  criminal  cases  whatever the jury  shall  have  the  right  to  determine  the
law  and  the  facts., 329   This  could  materially  aid  in  facilitating  jury
nullification.  Seven percent  of the  total population  lived in these  three  states,
and this right was  found  in  17%  of Midwestern-Western  state  constitutions,
in  no  Northeastern  state
in  7%  of  Southern  state  constitutions,  and 
constitutions.  One clause  was  in  a pre-1855  constitution;  the other  two  were
in post- 1855  constitutions.

J.  Rights Against Excessive Punishments

turns 

the  Eighth  Amendment 

Following  the  protection  of  the  right  to  a  civil  jury  trial  in  the
to  the  subject  of
Seventh  Amendment, 
protecting  against  excessive  punishments.  In particular,  it forbids  excessive
bail,  excessive  fines,  and  cruel  and  unusual  punishments.  One  ambiguity  of
the  Cruel  and  Unusual  Punishment  Clause  is  whether  it  forbids  all dispro-
portionate  punishments  or  only  a  certain  set  of  punishments  that  were
thought  to  be  cruel  and unusual  200  years  ago,  like  drawing  and quartering.
Debate  has  also  focused  on  the  question  of whether  the  Cruel  and Unusual
Punishment  Clause  forbids  practices  that  would  be  condemned,  as  Trop  v.
Dulles says,  under the "evolving  standards  of decency  that  mark the  progress
of a  maturing  society. 33 °  Unsurprisingly,  state  constitutions  did  forbid  at
least some excessive  punishments  in  1868.

1.  Excessive Bail.-All thirty-seven  state  constitutions  in  1868-every
last one-provided  that excessive  bail  shall not be required  in  criminal  cases.
Protection  against  excessive  bail was  almost  always paired  with  state  consti-
tutional  bans  on  excessive  fines  and  on  cruel  and unusual  punishments.  A
typical  clause  tracked  the  language  of  the  federal  Eighth  Amendment,
stating,  "Excessive  bail  shall  not  be  required,  excessive  fines  shall  not  be
imposed, and cruel  and unusual punishments  shall not be  inflicted., 331  Obvi-
ously,  all  Americans  in  all  three  regions  of the  country  lived  under  state

constitutions  with this  rule, and  the  rule  was  found  in all  pre-  and  post-1855
state  constitutions.  There  can  be  no  question  that  there  was  a fundamental
right  under  state  constitutional  law  to  be  protected  from  excessive  bail  in
1868.  It  can  be argued  that  the  Supreme  Court signaled  its  willingness  to  in-
corporate  this  right against  the  states  through  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  in
1971,332  although  it  has  not  technically  done  so  thus  far.  This  finding  may
have  implications  for  the  constitutionality  of preventive  detention  in  some
circumstances.

2.  Excessive Fines. -Thirty-five 

inflicted., 333   Ninety-two  percent  of  Americans 

states,  or  an  Article  V,  three-quarters
consensus  in  1868,  provided  explicitly  in  their  state  constitutions  that  exces-
sive  fines  not  be  imposed  upon  criminal  defendants.  A  typical  clause
banning  excessive  fines  stated, "Excessive  bail  shall  not  be  required,  exces-
sive  fines  shall  not  be  imposed,  and cruel  and unusual punishments  shall not
be 
in  1868-a  huge
supermajority-lived  in  states  with  constitutions  that banned  excessive  fines.
A  ban  on  excessive  fines  was  found  in  100%  of  the  Southern  state
constitutions,  in  92%  of the  Midwestern-Western  state  constitutions,  and  in
90%  of the  Northeastern  state  constitutions.  Eighty-nine  percent  of the pre-
1855  constitutions  and  100%  of the post-1855  constitutions  banned  excessive
fines.

3.  Cruel and  Unusual Punishments.-The ban  on  cruel  and  unusual
punishments  dates back to the  English Bill  of Rights  of 1689,334  the language
of which  was  exactly  replicated  in the  Eighth Amendment  of our federal Bill
of Rights.335  Despite  the ban's longstanding  history,  modem  debates rage  as
to the  types  of punishments  that  should  be  considered  cruel  and  unusual.336
The  use  of capital  punishment  is  often  the  focus  of these  debates,  as  evi-
denced  by  the  Supreme  Court's  recent  seminal  decision  holding  that  a

332.  See  Schilb  v.  Kuebel,  404  U.S.  357,  366  (1971) 

(stating,  in  dicta,  that  "the  Eighth
Amendment's  proscription  of excessive  bail  has  been  assumed  to  have  application  to  the  States
through the Fourteenth  Amendment").

nor excessive  Fines imposed nor cruell and  unusuall Punishments  inflicted").

including  whether  or  not  the  particular  punishment  is  degrading  to  human  dignity,  whether  the
punishment  is  "inflicted  in  a  wholly  arbitrary  fashion,"  whether  the  punishment  is  "clearly  and
totally rejected  throughout  society,"  and  whether  or not  the punishment  is  "patently  unnecessary");

jurisprudence).

Thirty-four  states-or  an  Article  V,  three-quarters  consensus-in  1868
had  clauses  in  their  state  constitutions  that  banned  cruel  and  unusual
punishments.  Although  there  was  some  variation  in  language,  as  discussed
below, a typical  such clause  read,  "That  excessive  bail  shall  not  be required,
nor excessive  fines imposed,  nor cruel  and unusual punishments  inflicted., 338
Ninety-one  percent of all  Americans  in  1868-again  a  huge  supermajority-
lived in  states  with bans  on  cruel  and unusual  punishments.  Such a ban  was
found  in  100%  of  Southern  state  constitutions,  in  92%  of  Midwestern-
Western  state  constitutions,  and  in  80%  of Northeastern  state  constitutions.
Eighty-three  percent of the pre-18 55  state  constitutions had bans on cruel  and
unusual  punishments  while  100%  of the  post-1855  state  constitutions  had
such  bans.  Seventeen  of the  thirty-four  states  with  such  bans  banned  cruel
the  Eighth
and  unusual  punishments, 
Amendment. 339  Fourteen  of those  thirty-four  states  went  even  further  than
the  federal  Eighth  Amendment  and  banned  cruel  or unusual  punishments.340
Four  states  banned  only  cruel  punishments  with  no  reference  to  unusual
punishments.34'  The  Eighth  Amendment  protection  against  cruel  and  un-
usual punishment  was  incorporated  as  a matter of substantive  due process  in

4.  Proportionality.-Only nine  states  out  of  thirty-seven  in  1868-a
minority  of slightly  less  than  one-quarter  of the  states  then  in  the  Union-
explicitly  required  in  their  state  constitutions  that  all  penalties  and punish-
ments  be  proportioned  to  the  offense.  This  is  striking  because  the  U.S.
Supreme  Court  has  found  a  proportionality  principle 
in  the  Fourteenth
Amendment  since  its decision  in  Weems  v.  United States in  1910. 34 '  A typi-
cal  proportionality  clause  in  1868  provided,  "[A]ll  punishments  ought  to  be
proportioned  to  the  offence.",344   Only  21%  of  Americans

minority  of  about  one-fifth  of  the  total  population-lived  in  states  with
proportionality  requirements.  Such  requirements  were  fairly  evenly  dis-
persed  across 
the  country,  with  30%  of  Northeastern  states,  25%  of
Midwestem-Western  states,  and  20%  of Southern  states  including  them  in
their  constitutions.  Proportionality  requirements  were  found  in  28%  of  the
pre- 1855  constitutions  and  21%  of the  post- 1855  constitutions.  Again, these
explicit proportionality  requirements  are  interesting  to us  today because  they
are  relevant to  the debate  about whether or not cruel-and-unusual-punishment
clauses  implicitly  require  proportionality  of punishment.  In  Weems,  a federal
Eighth  Amendment  case,  and  later  in  Solem  v.  Helm,345  a  state  Fourteenth
Amendment  case,  the  Supreme  Court held that they  do.346  However,  signifi-
cant  disagreement  still exists within  the  Court.347  The  existence  of only nine
explicit proportionality  clauses  in state  constitutions  in  1868  may  be relevant
to  the modem  debate.  Of course,  it is  always possible  that some  states  lacked
proportionality  clauses because  citizens  thought their  states'  ban on cruel  and
unusual punishment  already banned  disproportionate punishment  or that such
a ban  was  an  inalienable  natural  right that, as we  shall  see  below,  some  state
constitutions  explicitly and textually  protected.

5.  Prisoners Rights.-Five  states 

in  1868-a  small  minority-had
clauses  with  explicit prisoners-rights  protections  in  their  state  constitutions.
Whether  this  meant prisoners  rights  were  or  were  not  protected  by  bans  on
cruel  and  unusual  punishment  in  1868  is  a question  beyond  the  scope  of this
Article.  Although  there  was  variation  in  their  wording,  a typical  prisoners-
rights  clause  in  1868  provided,  "That  no person  arrested  or  confined  in jail
shall  be  treated with  unnecessary  rigor.', 348  Eleven  percent  of Americans  in
1868  lived  in  states  with  constitutions  that  protected  prisoners  rights  in  this
fashion.  Prisoners  rights  were  protected  by  17%  of Midwestern-Western
state  constitutions,  in  13%  of  Southern  state  constitutions,  and  in  10%  of
Northeastern  state  constitutions.  Seventeen percent  of the  pre-1855  constitu-
tions  and  11%  of the  post-1855  constitutions  had protections  of this  kind  for
prisoners rights.

Individual  Rights Under  State Constitutions  in  1868

6.  Penal Principles.-Four states  in  1868-a  minority-established
various penal  principles  of some kind.  The  Indiana  and Oregon  constitutions
provided  that  their  penal  codes  would  "be  founded  on  the  principles  of
reformation,  and  not  of  vindictive  justice. 3 49   A  third  state-North
Carolina-provided  in  its  constitution,  "The  objects  of the  punishments  be-
ing  not  only  to  satisfy  justice,  but  also  to  reform  the  offender,  and  thus
prevent  crime,  murder,  arson,  burglary,  and  rape,  and  these  only,  may  be
punishable  with  death, if the  general  assembly shall  so  enact. '' 350  In contrast,
the  fourth  state-Vermont--called  for  continued  visible  punishments  of in-
carceration  of long duration  in order to deter the commission  of crimes and to
make  sanguinary  laws  less  necessary. 351  Eight percent of Americans  in  1868
lived in  states that  based their penal  codes  on principles  of reformation.  Such
principles  were  declared  constitutional  in  17%  of Midwestern-Western  state
constitutions, 
in  10%  of
Northeastern  state  constitutions.  Such clauses  were equally  common in older
and more recent  constitutions.

in  13%  of  Southern  state  constitutions,  and 

7.  Sanguinary Laws.-Three  states  in  1868-a  minority-prohibited
sanguinary  laws.  A  typical  clause  provided,  "[A]  multitude  of sanguinary
laws  is both  impolitic  and unjust.  The  true  design  of all punishments  being
to reform, not  to  exterminate,  mankind., 352  These three  states-Maine,  New
Hampshire,  and  Maryland--contained  3%  of  the  American  population.
These  states  are in  addition to  the three  that had reformative  penal  principles.
Two were  in the  Northeast  and  one  was  in  the  South.  Two  had constitutions
ratified  before  1855,  and  one  had  a constitution  ratified  after  1855.  One  of
these  state  constitutional  provisions-that  of  Maryland-was  somewhat
weaker  than the  others  in  that  it provided  only that  sanguinary  laws  ought to
be avoided.353

8.  Whipping.-One state-Georgia--explicitly  prohibited  whipping  as

punishment  in  1868  in  the  three-quarters  majority  of  states  that  outlawed
such punishment  is a question beyond the  scope of this Article.

9.  Corporal  Punishment.-Three  additional 

states 

in 

1868-a

in 

the  Northeast,  and 

minority-prohibited  subjecting  citizens  to  corporal  punishment under  some
circumstances.  These  states  contained  7% of  the  population.  One  state-
Maine-was 
two  states-Tennessee  and  South
Carolina-were  in  the  South.  Two  of the  constitutions  were  pre-1855,  and
one  was  post-1855.  South Carolina provided  an outright  ban,355  while Maine
and  Tennessee  banned  subjecting  citizens  to  corporal  punishment  under
military  law.356   Again,  the  question  whether  corporal  punishment  would
have  been  viewed  as  cruel  and  unusual  in  1868  in  the  various  states  is  a
question  beyond the  scope of this Article.

10. Imprisonment for Debt. -Twenty-eight 

states  out  of thirty-seven  in
1868,  or  an  Article  V,  three-quarters  majority,  prohibited  imprisonment  for
debt.  Alabama,  for example,  provided  simply,  "[N]o  person  shall  be  impris-
oned  for debt. ' ,357  Some  states  made  an  explicit exception  to  the prohibition
in cases  of fraud. 358  Seventy-four  percent of the total  population in  1868-or
slightly  less than  three-fourths  of all  Americans-lived  in  states  with  consti-
tutions  that  explicitly  prohibited  imprisonment  for debt.  The  protection  was
the  least  common  in the  Northeast;  100%  of Midwestern-Western,  80%  of
Southern,  but  only  40%  of Northeastern  state  constitutions  prohibited  im-
prisonment  for  debt.  The  presence  of a  specific  ban  on  imprisonment  for
debt could  be  argued  to  imply  that  there  was  no proportionality  principle  in
state cruel-and-unusual-punishment  clauses  in  1868,  or  it could  be  argued  to
suggest  a  consensus  against  one  of many  forms  of  punishment  that  was
disproportionate.

11.  Witness  Detention. -Seven 

states 

in  1868-again  a  minority-

prohibited  the  unreasonable  detention  of  witnesses  in  criminal  cases.  A
typical  such  clause  stated,  "Excessive  bail  shall  not  be  required,  nor  exces-
sive  fines  imposed,  nor  shall  cruel  and  unusual punishment  be inflicted,  nor

355.  S.C.  CONST.  of  1868,  art.  I,  §  16  ("All  persons  shall,  before  conviction,  be  bailable  by

and  excessive  bail  shall not  in any  case  be required, nor corporal  punishment  inflicted.").

shall witnesses be  unreasonably detained.3 59  Twenty  percent  of Americans
lived  in states  in  1868  with  constitutional  protections  of this kind.  Such pro-
tections  were  found  in  25%  of Midwestern-Western  state  constitutions  in
1868,  in  20%  of  Southern  state  constitutions,  and  in  10%  of Northeastern
state  constitutions.  Witness  detention was prohibited  in  17%  of the  pre-1855
constitutions  and in 21%  of the post-1855  constitutions.

K.  State Constitutional Acknowledgment  of the Existence of Unenumerated

or Natural Rights

The  Ninth  Amendment,  in  the  federal  Bill of Rights,  explicitly  says,
"The  enumeration  in the Constitution,  of certain  rights,  shall not be construed
to  deny  or  disparage  others  retained  by  the  people. 360  Some  have  argued
that  the  Ninth  Amendment  secures  natural-law  unenumerated  rights  from
congressional  intrusion,36'  while  others  have  argued  that  the  provision  was
put in  simply to avoid arguments  that the federal  Bill of Rights preempted the
protection  of other  rights  such  as  those  in  state  bills  of rights.362  Everyone
agrees  that  the  Ninth  Amendment  is  not  incorporated  by  the  Fourteenth
Amendment  to  apply  against  the  states,  but  some  believe  that  the  Fourteenth
Amendment  is  itself a  font  of judicially  enforceable  unenumerated  natural-
law  rights, 363 while  others  argue  that  it is not. 364  This  raises rather  insistently
the  question  of whether  state  bills of rights  in  1868  had what  Professor  John
Yoo  has called  "baby Ninth Amendments. 365  It turns out many  of them did.
The  following  graph  shows the  number  of unenumerated  rights guarantees  in
older  and  newer  constitutions  and  exposes  a dramatic  increase  in  the  preva-
lence  of such  rights over  time.

AMENDMENT  AND  THE  CONSTITUTIONAL  RIGHTS  AMERICANS  DON'T  KNOW  THEY  HAVE  197
(2007)  (asserting  that  the  Ninth  Amendment  was  established  to  preserve  federal  unenumerated
rights).

362.  See  Kurt T.  Lash,  The Lost Jurisprudence of the Ninth Amendment, 83 TEXAS  L. REV.  597,
600-01  (2005)  (arguing  that despite  its reference  to "retained  rights,"  the  primary intent  of the Ninth
Amendment  was  to  protect  the  states  from  overly  broad  interpretations  of  federal  power).  For  a
modern  commentary  about  Ninth  Amendment  protection  of  fundamental  rights,  see  generally
FARBER,  supra note  361.

363.  See FARBER,  supra note  361,  at 69 (arguing  that the  drafters  of the  Fourteenth  Amendment
used vague language  because  they  wanted  it to protect  "fundamental  rights,"  and  quoting John Hart
Ely's interpretation  of the  Privileges  or  Immunities  Clause as  "'a  delegation to  future constitutional
decision-makers  to  protect  certain  rights  that  the  document  neither  lists,  at  least  not exhaustively,
nor even in  any  specific way gives  direction  for finding"').

364.  See  Lash, supra note  362,  at 601,  651-53  (describing  how  courts from  Reconstruction  to
the  New  Deal applied  the  Madison  rule  of Ninth  Amendment construction  to prohibit the  use of the
Fourteenth  Amendment  as  a  tool  for  the  enumeration  of any  rights  that  deny  or  disparage  the
retained rights  of the people).

365.  See  John  Choo  Yoo,  Our Declaratory Ninth Amendment,  42  EMORY  L.J.  967,  968-69
(1993)  (observing  that  state  constitutions,  in  the  late  eighteenth  and  early  nineteenth  centuries,
contained Ninth  Amendment analogs).

Texas Law  Review

[Vol.  87:7

1.  State  Constitutional Law  Recognition  of Natural and Inalienable
Rights.-Twenty-seven  out  of thirty-seven  state  constitutions  in  1868-or'
two-thirds  of the  states but  not an Article  V consensus-declared  as  a  matter
of  positive  state  constitutional  law  the  existence  of  natural,  inalienable,
inviolable,  or  inherent  rights.  A  typical  such  state  constitutional  provision
read,  "All  men  are by  nature  free  and  independent,  and  have  certain  inalien-
able  rights,  among  which  are  those  of  enjoying  and  defending  life  and
liberty,  acquiring,  possessing  and protecting  property:  and pursuing  and  ob-
taining  safety  and  happiness. 3 66  Seventy-one  percent  of all  Americans  in
1868  lived  in states  whose  positive  state  constitutional  law  acknowledged  the
existence  of these  kinds  of natural,  inalienable,  inviolable,  or  inherent  indi-
vidual  rights,  which,  as  we  have  seen,  could  well  have  included  gun  rights.
Clauses acknowledging  the existence  of these rights were  most popular  in the
Northeast, where  90%  of state  constitutions  had them.  This  was  followed by
75%  in  the  Midwest-West  and  60%  in  the  South.  Mention  of natural  and
inalienable  rights  was  more  common  in  older  constitutions  than  in  newer
ones.  Such references  were  found  in  83%  of the  pre-1855  constitutions  but
in 63%  of the post-1855  constitutions.  One  state-Kentucky-stated  that the
right to  own  slaves  was  a property  right and therefore  also  was  inviolable.367
It is  not clear  from reading  the text  of these  state  constitutional  bill-of-rights
provisions whether they were meant  to be judicially  enforceable  or not, and  if
they were  to  be  so  enforced,  how the  unenumerated  rights in  question would
be identified.

These  references  to  unenumerated  rights,  and  particularly  to  natural
and inalienable  rights,  deserve  special mention  because  their presence in  state
constitutions  in  1868  could  be read  to indicate  a belief  that  certain  rights-
including,  perhaps,  the  right  to  defend  life,  liberty,  and  property--exist  in
and  of themselves  as  preexisting  entitlements. 
In  other  words,  it  suggests
that  our  constitutions  and  bills  of rights  do  not  create rights  but  simply
declare or  recognize their  existence.  Although  modem-day  positivists  may
be tempted  to dismiss this view  as antiquated,  it is arguably  in  some  respects
echoed  in  present-day  substantive-due-process  decisions.  Our  nation  is
founded  on  the belief that  natural  and  inalienable  rights exist,  but  we  do  not
yet know for certain,  or have  consensus  about,  what they  all  are,  nor is there
any indication  in  the  state  constitutions  from  1868  that  such  rights  are judi-
cially  discoverable  or  enforceable.  Certainly  the right  to  defend  life,  liberty,
and property  is different  from what the  modem  Supreme  Court has protected
under  the rubric  of a right to privacy.

2.  Fundamental Principles.-Seven states out of thirty-seven  in  1868-

a  minority-vaguely  mentioned  the  existence  of "fundamental  principles"

366.  E.g.,  CAL. CONST.  of 1849, art. 1, § 1.
367.  KY.  CONST.  of 1850,  art. XIII,  § 3.

2008]

Individual  Rights Under  State Constitutions  in  1868

and  emphasized  the  importance  of a  frequent  recurrence  to  them  in  order to
preserve  the  blessings  of  liberty.  A  typical  such  clause  provided,  "The
blessings of a  free  government can only be maintained  by a firm  adherence  to
justice,  moderation,  temperance,  frugality  and  virtue,  and  by frequent  recur-
rence  to  fundamental  principles. 368   These  clauses  seem  to  us  to  be
somewhat  analogous  to  the  state  constitutional  clauses  just  discussed  that
acknowledge  the  existence  of natural  and  inalienable  rights.  These  clauses
did not,  however,  explicitly  recognize  man's  inherent  freedom  in  the  state  of
nature.  And,  again,  there  is  no reason  to  think  these  clauses  were judicially
enforceable.  Twenty  percent  of the  American  people  in  1868  lived  in  states
with  these  clauses  in  their  state  constitutions.  Such  clauses  were  most com-
mon  in  the  Midwest-West,  where  25%  of the  states  had  them,  followed  by
20%  in  the Northeast, and  13%  in the  South.  Fundamental-principles  clauses
were  slightly  more  common  in  older  constitutions;  they  were  found  in  22%
of  the  pre-1855  constitutions  and  in  16%  of  the  post-1855  constitutions.
Some  states announced  a legal  right  of the people  to  demand  constant regard
of these  principles from their public  officers. 369  None  of these  grandiose  and
enigmatic  clauses  described  the  fundamental  principles  they  referred  to  with
any  specificity.

3.  Ninth  Amendment  Analogs. -Eighteen 

out  of  thirty-seven  state
constitutions 
in  1868-slightly  fewer  than  one-half--contained  clauses
analogous  to  the  Ninth Amendment  of the  federal  Constitution.  These  baby
Ninth  Amendments  declared  that  the  enumeration  of rights in  state constitu-
tions  should  not  be  construed  to  impair  or  deny  other  rights  retained  by  the
people. 370   Thirty-three  percent  of  Americans  lived  in  states  with  Ninth
Amendment  analogs.  The  prevalence  of baby  Ninth  Amendments  varied
greatly  by region-they  were  found  in  67%  of Midwestern-Western  states,
20%  of  Northeastern  state  constitutions,  and  13%  of  Southern  state
constitutions.  Ninth  Amendment  analogs  were  also  more  common  in  recent
constitutions,  as  they  were  present  in  28%  of the  pre-1855  and  68%  of the
post-1855  constitutions.

All eighteen  Ninth  Amendment  analogs  are  virtually  identical  to  each
other  and to  the Ninth  Amendment  of the  federal Constitution,  stating,  "The
enumeration  of the  foregoing rights  shall  not be  construed  to  impair  or deny
others  retained  by  the  people. '37'  Once  again,  scholars  and judges  disagree

368.  E.g.,  WIS.  CONST.  of  1848,  art. I,  § 22.
369.  E.g.,  MASS.  CONST.  of  1780,  pt.  1,  art.  XVIII  ("[T]he  fundamental  principles  of  the
constitution...  are absolutely  necessary  to preserve  the advantages  of liberty, and to maintain  a  free
government.  The  people..,  have  a  right to require  of their lawgivers  and magistrates  an exact and
constant  observance  of them .... ").

370.  See,  e.g.,  ME.  CONST.  of  1819,  art.  I,  §  24  ("The  enumeration  of certain  rights  shall  not

impair  nor deny  others  retained by the people.").

[Vol.  87:7

as  to  whether  the  principal  thrust  of the  federal  Ninth  Amendment  is  as  an
anti-preemption  federalism  provision  or  as  a  protection  for  unenumerated,
natural-law  individual  rights. 372  As  Professor  Akhil  Amar has argued,  these
baby  Ninth Amendments  present  in  state  constitutions  in  1868  at  the  time  of
the  ratification  of the  Fourteenth  Amendment  may  intimate  a transformation
of the  Ninth  Amendment  from  a  federalism  clause  in  1791  to  more  of "a
free-floating  affirmation  of unenumerated  rights"  in  1868. 
However,  this
theory  of  transformation  presumes 
the  states  with  baby  Ninth
Amendments  did not  adopt  baby  Tenth  Amendments  as  well,  and that  there
were  no federalism provisions  in  state  constitutions  in  1868.  As we  shall see,
three  states  did adopt  Tenth  Amendment  analogs,  and  that  may  muddy  the
significance  of the existence  of baby Ninth Amendments.

ited  to  the  States  by  the  federal  Constitution  are  reserved  to  the  States

people  in  1868  lived  in  states  with  Tenth  Amendment  analogs  in  their  state
constitutions.  The  three  states  with  such  analogs  constituted  20%  of  the

Amendment  analogs  appeared 
compared  with  5% of the  post-1855  constitutions.  The  adoption  of Tenth
Amendment  analogs  in  state  constitutions  is  perhaps  somewhat  surprising
because  they  purport to  limit federal  power  as  a  matter  of state  positive  law.
They  are  probably  best understood  as declaring  the  relationship  between  the
states  and  the  federal  government  just  as  the  baby  Ninth  Amendments  may
have declared  the existence  of individual  rights.

5.  Is  the Existence of Unenumerated Natural-Law Rights Itself Deeply
Rooted in  History and Tradition?-We have  reported  here  how  many  of the
thirty-seven  state  constitutions  in  1868  either  protected  natural  and  inalien-
able  rights,  protected  fundamental  principles,  or  had  Ninth  Amendment
It  turns  out  that  in  1868  twenty-nine  state  constitutions-78%,
analogs. 
greater  than  an  Article  V  consensus-protected  unenumerated  rights  in  one
of these  three  guises  as  a  matter  of positive  state  constitutional  law.  If  one
excludes  states  whose  constitutions  protect  fundamental  principles  (a  vaguer
term)  and  looks  only  at state  constitutions  recognizing  either  natural  and  in-
alienable  rights  or  having  Ninth  Amendment  analogs,  the  number  of  states
with  such  protections  remains  at  twenty-nine-an  astounding  Article  V
federal-constitutional  consensus.  This  is  a  very  high  percentage  of the  total
number  of states in  1868 and therefore  suggests  that, with regard  to  questions
about  what  rights  are  so  deeply  rooted as  to  be  fundamental,  the  concept  of
natural,  inalienable,  and  unenumerated  rights may  itself be  deeply  rooted  in
history  and  tradition.  This  is  an ironic  outcome.  If the whole  point  of look-
ing  at what  rights  are  deeply rooted in  history and  tradition  is  to  give  content
to the unenumerated  rights  protected  by the  Fourteenth  Amendment,  then the
conclusion  of an  exhaustive  study  of history  and  tradition  such  as  this  one
suggests that  the framers  of the Fourteenth  Amendment  may have  believed in
natural  law could  be said to  call  positive-law historical  inquiries  like  our own
into  question.  Nonetheless,  it  bears  repeating  that  there  is  no  indication  in
the  baby  Ninth  Amendments  or  other  similar  provisions  we  found  that they
were  meant  to  authorize  judges  to  invent  new  rights  and  apply  them  in

It  seems  doubtful  the  framers  of  that

judicially  invented  unenumerated  rights.  But  then  again,  maybe  they  just

blessed with that result, depending  on one's point of view.

We  have  now come to  the end of the  rights secured  by the  federal  Bill
of Rights  or by  Article  I,  Sections  Nine  or  Ten  of the  original  constitution.
There  are,  however,  a number  of additional rights we  found in  state  constitu-
tions  in  1868  that  are  of great interest to  federal  constitutional  case  law.  We
will proceed to  discuss those additional  rights in no particular order below.

L.  Right to  Travel

The  U.S.  Supreme  Court  has  protected  a  right  to  travel  in  Shapiro v.
Thompson376  and  arguably  to  some  degree  in  Saenz  v.  Roe. 377 
It  is  argued
that a right  to  travel  is  implicit  in the  structure  of the  federal  Constitution. 378
Even  The  Slaughterhouse Cases, while  gutting the  Fourteenth  Amendment,
recognized  that  there  must be  an implicit  individual  right  of citizens  to  travel
to  Washington,  the  seat  of government. 379  Interestingly,  a  number  of state
constitutions  recognize  a  right to  immigrate  into  a  state  or  to  emigrate  from
it, which  means  they  to  some  degree  acknowledge  the  existence  of a  right  to
travel.

1.  Immigration.-Eleven  states 

in  1868-a  minority-specifically
protected  the  right  to  immigrate  into  their  state  as  a  matter  of  positive
constitutional  law by  guaranteeing  out-of-staters  who  came  to  reside  in their

such  clause  provided,  "Foreigners  who  are  or  may  hereafter  become  bona-

Individual  Rights  Under State  Constitutions  in  1868

fide  residents  of this  State  shall  enjoy  the  same  rights  in  respect  to  the
possession,  enjoyment,  and 
as  native-born
citizens., 380  Fifteen  percent  of Americans  in  1868  lived  in  states  that  pro-
tected  the  rights  of  out-of-staters  in  this  way.  These  clauses  were  most
popular  in  the  Midwest-West,  where  they  were  found  in  67%  of  state
constitutions.  Such  constitutional  clauses  were  present  in  13%  of Southern
state  constitutions  and  10%  of Northeastern  state  constitutions.  Immigration
protections  were  found  in  22%  of the  pre-1855  constitutions  and  37%  of the
post-1855  constitutions.  These  clauses  are  technically  superfluous  because
the  Privileges  and 
IV  of  the  federal
Constitution  already  guaranteed  these  rights  to  out-of-staters  in  a  state  as  a
matter of federal  constitutional  law.381

Immunities  Clause  of  Article 

2.  Emigration.-Six states  out  of thirty-seven  in  1868-a  minority-

explicitly  protected  the  right  of their  citizens  to  emigrate.  A  typical  clause
provided, "[E]migration  from the  State  shall  not be prohibited. 382  This  type
of clause  is  more  striking  than the  immigration  clauses.  It  clearly  acknowl-
edges  and  gives life to  an  important fundamental  liberty-the  liberty to  flee  a
jurisdiction  that  is  becoming  tyrannical.  Twenty-one  percent  of Americans
in  1868  lived  in  states  whose  constitutions  guaranteed  the  right  to  emigrate.
This  right  was  slightly  more  evenly  distributed  than  the  right  to  immigrate.
We  found it in  20%  of Northeastern,  17%  of Midwestern-Western,  and  13%
of Southern  state  constitutions  in  1868.  It  was  twice as  common  before  1855
than after  1855.

3.  Not  Forfeit Residence.-Three states  in  1868-a  small  minority-

protected  the  property  of citizens  who  temporarily  left  the  state.  A typical
such  clause  provided,  "Temporary  absence  from  the  State  shall  not  forfeit  a
residence  once  obtained., 383  Nine  percent  of Americans  had  this protection
as  a  matter  of state  constitutional  law  in  1868.  The  protection  was  found
only 
state
constitutions.  It was twice  as common after  1855  than before  1855.

in  8%  of  Midwestern-Western 

in  13%  of  Southern  and 

In  sum, there  are  some  hints  at protection  of a right  to  travel in  positive
state  constitutional  law  in  1868,  which  is  interesting  to  the  extent  that  the
federal  Constitution can be argued to imply  such a right.

M  Equality Rights

The  federal  Constitution  guarantees  equality  rights most  famously  in
Section  One  of the Fourteenth  Amendment,  which  forbids  the making  of dis-
criminatory  laws  and the  unequal  application  of neutral  laws  on  state  statute
books.384  This equality guarantee  of the Fourteenth  Amendment  was  reverse-
incorporated  into  the  Fifth  Amendment's  Due  Process  Clause  in  Boiling v.
Sharpe.385 
In  Frontiero v.  Richardson,386  the  federal  guarantee  of equality
rights  against  the  national  government  was  expanded  to  apply  to  women  as
well  as racial  and  ethnic minorities. 387  It  may have  been  expanded  in Romer
v.  Evans388 to  apply to  gays  and lesbians  as  well. 389  Finally,  the original  fed-
eral  Constitution  guaranteed  a  form  of  equality  by  forbidding  titles  of
nobility  and  therefore  by  forbidding  feudalism. 39°  Feudalism,  like  a  system
of racial-caste  apartheid,  violates  the  notion  that  all  citizens  are  born  equal
and  must always  have  equal  civil  and political  rights.  What  did state  consti-
tutional  law  have  to  say  about  this  in  1868-a  mere  three  years  after  the
conclusion  of the Civil  War?

1.  Equal Protection of the Laws  Clauses.-Although use  of the  Equal
Protection  Clause  got off to  a  slow  start,391 the  Court  at  least  since Brown  v.
Board of Education392  has used  it as  a  primary tool for  protecting  fundamen-
tal  rights. 393   The  basic  inquiry  in  equal-protection  cases  is  whether  the
government's  classifications  or  restrictions  are  justified  by  a  sufficient

purpose,  and differing  levels  of scrutiny  are  applied depending  on the  type of
discrimination  involved.394  Of particular  interest  here  is  the  way  in  which
courts  use  equal-protection  clauses  to  protect  fundamental  rights  (as  opposed
to  discrimination  based on specific characteristics). 395

Nineteen  states  out  of  thirty-seven 

in  1868-a  bare  majority-

specifically  guaranteed  "equality"  of some  kind  or  equal  protection  of the
laws  in  their  state  constitutions.  The  nineteen  clauses  we  found  protecting
equal  protection  varied  considerably  in  their  wording.  For  example,  the
Connecticut  constitution  provided  simply,  "[A]ll  men,  when  they  form a  so-
cial  compact,  are  equal  in rights;  and  that  no  man,  or set of men,  are entitled
to  exclusive  public  emoluments  or privileges  from the  community.' 396  South
Carolina's  constitution  contained  slightly  different  language:  "No title of no-

Distinction,  on  account  of race  or  color,  in  any  case  whatever,  shall  be
prohibited,  and  all  classes  of  citizens  shall  enjoy,  equally,  all  common,
public,  legal,  and political  privileges., 397  This  clause  is also  a privileges-or-
immunities  clause,  but we count  it here  because  it uses  the word "equally."

Forty-seven  percent  of Americans  in  1868  lived  in  states that  constitu-
tionally  guaranteed  equality  of  some  kind,  or  equal  protection.  Equal-
protection  clauses  were  by  far  most  common  in  the  South,  where  87%  of
In  contrast,  they  were  found  in  33%  of Midwestern-
states  had  them. 
Western  state  constitutions  and  30%  of  Northeastern  state  constitutions.
Equal-protection  clauses  were  also  a  relatively  more  modern  right  in  1868;
they could be  found  in  only 33%  of the pre-1855  constitutions  but  in 74%  of
the  post-1855  constitutions.  The  reason  for the  greater prevalence  of equal-
protection  clauses  in  Southern state  constitutions  and in  the more  recent  state
constitutions  in  1868  is  that  the  Southern  states  were  forced  to  adopt  such
provisions  in their  state  constitutions  as  a condition  of their being  readmitted
to  the  Union.398  It  is  ironic  therefore  to  find  the  former  slave  states  at  the
vanguard  of protecting  equality rights in  1868.

In  addition  to  the  nineteen  states with  explicit  equal-protection  clauses,
in  1868  contained  three  partial  equal-
the  Mississippi  state  constitution 
protection  clauses.  These  clauses  provided  for  equality  in  state  funding  of
charitable  and public  institutions; 399  in the  possession,  enjoyment,  or descent

latter  provision  is  striking  in  light  of the  Supreme  Court's  upholding  of seg-
regation  in  Plessy v.  Ferguson402  with  respect  to  the  public  conveyance  of
railroad  cars.40 3  The  Rhode  Island  state  constitution  in  1868  contained  a
somewhat  weaker  equal-protection  clause  that  called  for the  "burdens  of the

2.  Privileges and Immunities  Clauses.-To some,  the  Bill  of  Rights
seems the  most obvious  enumeration  of the privileges  and immunities  of citi-
zenship  in  the  United  States.40 5   Of  course,  this  argument  was  famously
foreclosed  in  The  Slaughterhouse Cases40 6  and  has  not  since  been  revisited
by  the  Supreme  Court.40 7  In  a seminal  law  review article  in  1992,  Professor
John  Harrison,  building on  the arguments  of Professor  David Currie,  showed
how  the  Privileges  or  Immunities  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment
could  have  originally  been  meant  to  be  the  main  equality  guarantee  of that
Amendment.40 8   Professor  Harrison  noted  that  the  Privileges  or  Immunities
Clause  said no  state  could "make"  a law  that  "abridged"  the rights  of its citi-
zens  by  discriminating  against  them.40 9  The  Black  Codes  were  unconstitu-
tional  because  they gave  an abridged  or  lesser set  of rights  to  freed  African-
Americans  than  were  given  to  white  Americans.4 10

Individual  Rights  Under  State Constitutions  in  1868

the  Equal  Protection  Clause  guaranteed  equal  enforcement  (or
while 
protection)  of those  laws  already  on  the  books.41 
If  Harrison  is  right, we
should  expect  to  see  some  equality-protecting  privileges-or-immunities
clauses in  state constitutions in  1868.

It turns out that  thirteen states out of thirty-seven  in  1868-a  minority-

explicitly  prohibited  either  the  deprivation  or the  unequal  provision  of privi-
leges  and  immunities.  Although  the  wording  differed  somewhat  by  state,  a
typical  such clause provided, "No  law  shall  be passed  granting to  any  citizen
or  class  of citizens  privileges  or  immunities  which,  upon  the  same  terms,
shall  not  equally  belong  to  all  citizens.,, 412   Thirty-four  percent  of  all
Americans  in  1868  lived  in  states  with  such  equal-protection  provisions.
These clauses  could be  found in  53%  of Southern state  constitutions  in  1868,
in  25%  of  Midwestern-Western 
in  20%  of
Northeastern  state  constitutions.  This  right  was  somewhat  less  common  in
pre-1855  constitutions,  where  it appeared  28%  of the time, while  it  appeared
in  42%  of  the  post-1855  constitutions.  The  significance  of these  thirteen
state  constitutional clauses  using  privileges-or-immunities  language as  equal-
protection  language  is  that  it may  provide  some  support  to  Harrison's  argu-
ment  that  the  federal  Fourteenth  Amendment  Privileges  or  Immunities
Clause  is  only  an  antidiscrimination  clause  and  not  a  font  of unenumerated
individual  rights,  whether  deeply  rooted  in  history  and  tradition  or  not.
Professor  Calabresi  has  previously  disagreed  with  Harrison,  arguing  that the
Clause  is  both  an  antidiscrimination  clause  and  a  protection  for  individual
rights,  and he stands  by that view.413

well,  even  though  feudalism  was  by  then  ancient  history.  Twenty-eight  out
of  thirty-seven  states--or  an  Article  V,  three-quarters  consensus-had
clauses  in  their  state  constitutions  that  explicitly  prohibited  feudalism.  A
typical  such clause provided:

Note  the  ban  on  any hereditary  distinctions.  Does  this  forbid  a  hereditary
right of the  descendants  of slaves to  privileged  treatment  to atone  for the  sin
committed  against  their  ancestors?  Eighty-seven  percent  of  Americans  in
1868-a  huge  supermajority-lived  in  states  that  banned  feudalism  in  this
way.  Feudalism  clauses  were  found  in  87%  of Southern  state  constitutions,
in  75%  of  Midwestern-Western 
in  70%  of
Northeastern  state  constitutions.  Such  clauses  were found  in  72%  of the pre-
1855  constitutions  and  in  84%  of the  post-1855  constitutions.  Some  states
banned  feudalism  by  also  declaring  all  lands  to  be  allodial,415  while  others
banned it as  well,  as we  shall  see below, by prohibiting  titles of nobility.416

state  constitutions,  and 

The  Article  V,  three-quarters  consensus  of  the  states  in  1868  that
feudalism was an unconstitutional  caste  system or class-based  system of laws
is arguably  of interest  with  regard  to modern  equal protection  law.  We  have
always  known  that  the  framers  of the  Fourteenth  Amendment  viewed  the
Black Codes  as  paradigmatic  systems  of class-based  law  that  they  wished  to
render  unconstitutional.417  It  looks  as  if feudalism  was  pretty  much  viewed
the  same  way  in  1868.  There  is no  direct evidence  on this  next point, but it
seems  highly  likely  that  if  one  had  asked  the  framers  of  the  Fourteenth
Amendment  if the  Hindu  caste  system-with  its  divisions  of the  population
into  Brahmins  and  untouchables-was  unconstitutional,  they  would  almost
certainly  have  said yes.  The Hindu caste  system, like  feudalism, and  like the
Black  Codes,  was  an  effort  to  create  a  class-based  social  system.  These  ob-
servations  are  arguably  of relevance  to  modern  debates  about  whether  laws
that  distinguish  on the basis of sex create  a class-based social  system as  well,
even if the  framers  of the Fourteenth  Amendment  did not appreciate  that fact.

4.  Nobility.-As part  of the  prohibition  on  feudalism,  twenty  states  out
of thirty-seven  in  1868-a  majority-specifically  prohibited titles  of nobility
or  hereditary  emoluments,  privileges,  and honors.  This  category  is  a  subset
of feudalism.  A  typical  clause  provided,  "No  title  of nobility  or  hereditary
emolument  shall  ever be  granted  in  this  State. ''418  Fifty-nine  percent  of the
population in  1868 lived in  states that  forbade  titles of nobility.  Such clauses
were  most  common  in  the  Northeast  and  the  South,  and were  found  in  60%
and  67%  of the  state  constitutions  in  those regions,  respectively.  They  were

provided,  "All  laws  of a  general  nature  shall  have  a uniform  operation. 422
This  wording,  of course,  applies  only to  the  operation  and not to  the  making
of the  laws.  Sixteen  percent of Americans  lived in  states with  such  clauses  in
their constitutions  in  1868.  Such  clauses were  found in  33%  of Midwestern-

detail  on  how long the grace  period would last for slaves  of varying  ages:

The  children  of slaves  born within  the  limits  of this  State  after  the  fourth  day  of July,
eighteen  hundred and  sixty-three,  shall be  free;  and  all slaves  within the  said State  who
shall, at the  time  aforesaid, be under  the  age  often years  shall be  free  when they arrive

N.  State Constitutional Prohibitions of Certain Named Vices

A  constant  theme  in  the  modem  U.S.  Supreme  Court's  substantive-
due-process  case  law  from  Griswold v.  Connecticut,423 to  Roe v.  Wade,424  to
the plurality  opinion in  Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v.
Casey,425  to  Lawrence v.  Texas  is that  the  unenumerated  rights  protected  by
the  Fourteenth  Amendment  include,  at  a  minimum,  a right  of sexual  auton-
omy  or bodily  integrity426 and,  at a  maximum,  what Justice  Harry  Blackmun
in  his  dissent  in Bowers  v.  Hardwick called  "the  right  to  be  let  alone., 427
Stated  most  broadly,  this  right  could  constitutionalize  John  Stuart  Mill's
harm  principle-a  principle  that  states  that  the  government  ought  only  to
legislate  to protect  individuals  from directly, physically  harming  one  another
without  consent.428  Laws  to  protect  individuals  from  harming  themselves
are,  under this view,  none  of the  government's  business.4 29  Some  have  read
Justice  Kennedy's  opinion  in  Lawrence v.  Texas  as  constitutionalizing  this
view,430  although  Professor  Calabresi  has  published  an  article  reading  that

a  lifetime,  choices  central  to personal  dignity  and  autonomy,  are  central  to the  liberty
protected  by  the  Fourteenth  Amendment.  At the  heart  of liberty  is  the  right  to  define
one's  own  concept  of existence,  of meaning,  of the  universe,  and  of the  mystery  of
human  life.  Beliefs  about  these  matters  could  not  define  the  attributes  of personhood

opinion  more narrowly.4 31  It is possible  that  all Lawrence creates  is  a  limited
realm  of  adult  consensual  sexual  freedom  where  money  has  not  been
exchanged.432  What  did  state  constitutions  in  1868  say  about  the  protection
of a  right  to  engage  in  conduct  beyond  the  sexual  realm that  violates  Mill's
harm  principle-so-called  victimless  crimes?  There  is  nothing  one  way  or
the  other  about  sexual  matters,  but there  are  a  few  state  constitutional  provi-
sions  that  explicitly  contemplate  a  state  role  in  banning  at  least  some
nonsexual  victimless  crimes.

1.  Lotteries. -Twenty-three 

states  out  of  thirty-seven 

in  1868-a

majority-specifically  prohibited the authorization  or sale  of lottery tickets  in
their  state  constitutions.  A  typical  such  clause  provided,  "The  legislature
shall never  authorize  any  lottery,  or the  sale of lottery tickets. 4 33  Since  gam-
bling  is  not  an activity  where  one  individual  directly  harms  another  without
the  other's  consent,  this  recognition  of the  power  of the  states  to  regulate
gambling  is  a  recognition  of the  power  to  prevent  people  from  engaging  in
conduct  that  is  harmful  to  themselves.  These  state  constitutional  clauses
might  sound to  modem  ears  as  if they only  forbade  state-run  lotteries.  If so,
"private"  gambling  might  be  permissible.  The  clauses  are  potentially
susceptible,  however,  to  a broader reading  that  forbids  legalization  of the sale
of  any  lottery  tickets.  Sixty-two  percent  of  Americans  in  1868-a  solid
majority-lived  in states  that  banned  legalization  of the sale  of lottery tickets
in  their  state  constitutions.  Thus,  it  is  highly  likely  that  whatever  rights  the
Fourteenth  Amendment  creates,  those  rights do  not  include  a  federal  consti-
tutional  right  to  gamble.  State  constitutional  bans on  lotteries were  found  in
83%  of  Midwestern-Westem  state  constitutions,  67%  of  Southern  state
constitutions,  and  30%  of Northeastern  state  constitutions.  Lottery bans  were
found  in 50%  of the pre- 1855  but in 74%  of the post- 1855  constitutions.  The
trend  in  1868,  then,  was toward  more morals  legislation, not less.

2.  Dueling.-One traditional  activity  between  two  mutually  consenting
adults  with  a  rich historical  pedigree  is dueling.  Duels  to  the  death  were  fa-
mously  fought  in  old  England  and  in  colonial  America;  even  Alexander
Hamilton,  one  of  the  brightest  and  most  illustrious  of  the  framers  of  our
Constitution,  was  willing  to  engage  in  a  duel  that  resulted  in  his  death.434
Thus,  surely  if the  framers  of the  Fourteenth  Amendment  had  meant  to  con-
stitutionalize  a  principle  of leaving  people  alone  or  of anti-paternalism  they

43 1.  See  Calabresi,  supra note  241,  at  1525-26  (arguing  that Lawrence was a  symbolic opinion

social change).

[Vol.  87:7

ought  to  have  left  in place  the  ancient  right  to  duel-a right that  could  even
have  been  said to have  been deeply  rooted  in  history and tradition.

The  evidence,  however,  from  the  thirty-seven  state  constitutions  in

effect  in  1868  says  otherwise.  Twenty-two  states  at that  time-a  majority-
had  specific  clauses  in  their  constitutions  that  penalized  or  discouraged
dueling.  Far from  recognizing  a right of mutually  consenting  adults  to  fight
to  the  death  the  way  professional  boxers  or  football  players  sometimes  do
even  today,  the  generation  that  ratified  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  was  pa-
ternalistic  when  it  came  to  dueling. 
Typical  of  the  twenty-two  state
constitutional  clauses  penalizing  dueling  is the  following  language  from the
Wisconsin  state constitution:

Any  inhabitant  of  this  State  who  may  hereafter  be  engaged,  either
directly  or  indirectly  in  a  duel,  either  as  principal  or  accessory,  shall
forever  be disqualified  as  an  elector, and  from  holding  any  office  un-
der  the  Constitution  and  laws  of this  State,  and  may  be  punished  in
such manner as  shall be prescribed  by law. 435

Not only  was  there not  a fundamental  right  to  duel,  there  was  a  fundamental
police  power  of  state  government  to  outlaw,  regulate,  and  discourage
dueling.  What  conclusions,  if any,  to  draw  from this  is  obviously  a  matter
for debate.

Looking  at bans  on dueling by population,  it turns  out that  69 0/-or  just
over  a  two-thirds  supermajority-of  all  Americans  in  1868  lived  in  states
with  paternalistic  anti-dueling  language  in  their  state  constitutions.  Such
anti-dueling  clauses  were  found  in  80%  of Southern,  75%  of Midwestern-
Western,  and  10%  of Northeastern  state  constitutions  in  1868.  They  were
relatively  recently  added clauses,  found in 44%  of the  pre-1855  constitutions
but  in  a  whopping  74%  of the  post-1855  constitutions.  This  is  consistent
with  the  idea that  America  between  1855  and  1868  was  a society  on  a series
of important  moral  crusades:  a  crusade  against  slavery  and  for  equal  civil
rights,  a  crusade  against  dueling,  a  crusade  for  women's  rights,  a  crusade
against lotteries,  and a crusade  against  alcohol that  culminated  many decades
later  in Prohibition.436  As  we  have just  seen,  most  state  constitutions  at this
time  discouraged  dueling by preventing  anyone  who  engaged  in  or assisted a
duel  from  holding  any  public  office.4 37  Others  provided  for  additional
punishments as could be prescribed  by law.4 38

3.  Alcohol-Speaking of lotteries  and  dueling,  we  are  naturally  led  to

Individual  Rights Under  State Constitutions  in  1868

Fourteenth  Amendment  in  1868  understand  it to  protect  a  fundamental  right
to  ingest  alcohol,  or, by  analogy,  drugs  or  other  substances  that  might  help
one  better  "define  one's  own  concept  of  existence,  of  meaning,  of  the
universe,  and of the mystery  of human life"? 439  Only three  state constitutions
in  1868-a  small  minority of the thirty-seven-prohibited  or severely limited
the  sale  and  use  of alcohol  within  the  state.  A  typical  state  constitutional
clause  in  this  genre  provided,  "No  license  to  traffic  in  intoxicating  liquors
shall hereafter  be  granted in  this State; but the general  assembly may,  by law,
provide against  evils  resulting therefrom  ... .,,440  Only  12%  of Americans  in
1868  lived  in  these  three  somewhat  dry  states.  Limits  on  alcohol  could  be
found  in  13%  of Southern,  10%  of Northeastern,  and  8%  of Midwestern-
Western  states.  None  of these  states were  in the  far West,  where  Westerners
must  still  at  that  time  have  liked  their  saloons.  Limits  on  alcohol  were
equally  common  in  1868  in  older  and  in  more  recent  constitutions. 
In
addition, West  Virginia had a weaker  clause permitting  the  legislature to pass
laws  regulating  or  prohibiting  liquor  sales. 441  What  conclusions,  if  any,  to
draw from this very limited  historical  data is a matter for fair debate.

0.  Government Structure

A  number  of state  constitutions  protected  individuals  or officeholders
with  rights  of government  structure  in  situations  where  the  absence  of those
rights  would  heavily  burden  individual  rights.  A  comprehensive  survey  of
the  common  government  structures  in  state  constitutions  in  1868  is well  be-
yond  the  scope  of this  article,  but  we  will  now  briefly  address  just  a  few
rights  of government  structure  that  served  to  protect  the  individual  rights  of
citizens  or  officeholders  and  that  were  arguably  deeply  rooted  in history  and
tradition in  1868.

1.  Separation of Powers.-Several  state  bills  of  rights  specifically
protected  individuals  from  being  subjected  to  the  authority  of a  government
official  simultaneously  exercising  a  combination  of  legislative,  executive,
and  judicial  power.  More  commonly,  the  state  constitutions  in  1868  had  a
separate  freestanding  article protecting  the  separation of powers  for the bene-
fit  of their  individual  citizens. 442  All  in  all,  twenty-nine  out  of thirty-seven
states  in  1868-or  an  Article  V,  three-quarters  consensus  of  the  states-
specifically  provided  for  the  division  of their  state  governments  into  three
separate  and  co-equal  departments:  the  executive,  the  judicial,  and  the

sale  of intoxicating  liquor within  the  limits of this  State.").

442.  E.g.,  VA.  CONST.  of  1864,  art.  II  ("The  legislative,  executive,  and  judiciary  departments
shall be separate  and  distinct,  so that  neither exercise  the  powers  properly  belonging  to either of the
others  ....").

[Vol.  87:7

legislative.  A  typical  separation-of-powers  clause  provided,  "The  powers  of
government  shall  be  divided  into  three  distinct  departments,  and  each  of
them confided  to  a separate  magistracy, to  wit:  those which are  legislative, to
one;  those  which  are  executive,  to  another;  and  those  which  are judicial,  to
another. ''443  Sixty-six  percent  of the total  U.S.  population  in  1868-roughly
two-thirds-lived  in  states  that  constitutionally  guaranteed  the  separation  of
powers.  Such  guarantees  could  be  found  in  93%  of  Southern,  70%  of
Northeastern,  and  67%  of Midwestern-Western  states.  Seventy-two  percent
of  the  pre-1855  and  84%  of  the  post-1855  constitutions  had  separation-of-
powers provisions.

This  fact  is  striking  because  Professor  Bruce  Ackerman  has  observed
that  James  Madison  proposed  adding  a  separation-of-powers  clause  to  the
federal  Constitution  but  the  framers  declined  to  do  SO. 4 44  Ackerman  reads  a
lot  into  their  failure  to  adopt  this  specific  clause.445  Others  have  suggested
the  separation  of powers  is  less  strictly  followed  at the  state  than  at the  fed-
eral  level. 446   Our  data  here  suggest,  however,  that  in  1868  when  the
Fourteenth  Amendment  was  ratified,  an  Article  V,  three-quarters  consensus
of the  states  supported  the  idea that  Americans  had  a fundamental  right  to  a
government  of separated powers.  What,  if anything,  a court  ought  to do  with
this data is a subject  for another  day.

2.  Power to  Suspend or Dispense  With  the  Laws.-A  big  issue  in  the
English  Revolution  of  1688  was  whether  the  King  had the  power to  suspend
or  dispense  with  Acts  of Parliament,  or  whether  only  Parliament  could  sus-
pend its  own laws.447 
In response  to  this  concern,  the  framers  of the  federal
Constitution  specifically  imposed  a  duty  on  the  President  that he  take  care
that  the laws  be faithfully  executed. 448  The  framers  put the  Take Care  Clause
in  our  Constitution  to  make  it  clear  that  the  President  did  not  have  a  dis-
pensing power.449

Individual  Rights Under  State Constitutions  in  1868

It  is  striking  in  this  respect  that  sixteen  states-a  minority,  although  a
very  sizeable  one-had  language  in  their  state  constitutions  that  explicitly
granted  the  power  to  suspend  laws  exclusively  to the  legislature. A  typical
such  clause  provided,  "[N]o  power  of  suspending  laws  shall  be  exercised,
unless  by the legislature  or its authority. ' '450  By population,  this limit  applied

Southern,  and  25%  of Midwestern-Western  state  constitutions.  Fifty percent
of the  pre-1855  and  37%  of the  post-1855  state  constitutions  limited  the
suspension  of laws.

Even  more  dramatically,  fully  thirty-two  states  out  of thirty-seven  in
1868-or  an  Article  V  constitutional  consensus-provided  specifically  in
their  state  constitutions  that  the  governor  "shall  take  care  that  the  laws  be
faithfully  executed., 451   Eighty-nine  percent  of  the  population-a  huge
supermajority-lived  in  these  thirty-two  states.  Take-care  clauses  could  be

post-1855  constitutions.  Americans  may  thus  have  a  fundamental  right  not
to  have  the  executive  suspend  the  laws  that  apply  to  them,  a  right  that  is
deeply  rooted  in  history  and  tradition.  Admittedly,  state  take-care  clauses

4.  Right of Speech or Debate in the Legislature.-Twenty-six states  out

of thirty-seven  in  1868-or  two-thirds  but not  three-quarters  of the  total-
specifically  protected  the  freedom  of speech,  deliberation,  and  debate  in  the
legislature  by  prohibiting  its use  as  a  foundation  for prosecution  or  civil  ac-
tion in  any court.  The  state  constitutions  typically provided, "For  any speech
or  debate  in  either  house  of the  Legislature,  the  members  shall  not  be  ques-
tioned in  any  other  place. 454  Eighty  percent  of all  Americans  in  1868  lived
in  states  with  speech-or-debate  clauses  in their  constitutions.  There  was  sig-
nificant  geographical  variance  in  the presence  of speech-or-debate  clauses-
100%  of Northeastern,  67%  of Midwestern-Western,  and  53%  of  Southern
states  protected  legislative  speech  or  debate.  There was  also  significant  dif-
ference  by  date-94%  of  the  pre-1855  and  47%  of  the  post-1855
constitutions  had speech-or-debate  clauses.

5.  Privilege from  Civil Process (for Legislators).-A right  related  to
protection  for  speech  or  debate  is  privilege  from  civil  process  during  a
legislative  session.  Readers  here  will  remember  former  President  Bill
Clinton's  claim  for  a  presidential  privilege  from  civil  process  in  the  Paula
time  he  held  office  as

President.45
1  Seven  states  in  1868-a  minority-gave  members  of  their
legislatures privilege  from civil process  during a legislative  session  (and for a
designated  time  period  surrounding  that  session).  Usually  coupled  with  a
privilege  from arrest, these  clauses  stated,

the 

Members  of the  legislature  shall,  in  all  cases  except  treason,  felony,
and  breach  of the  peace,  be  privileged  from  arrest,  and  they  shall  not
be subject to any civil process during the  session  of the  legislature,  nor
for  fifteen days  next before the  commencement  and  after the  termina-
tion of each  session.456

Twelve  percent  of the  population  in  1868  lived in states with  these clauses  in
their constitutions.  Such  clauses  were found  in 33%  of Midwestern-Western
13%  of  Southern  state  constitutions,  and  10%  of
state  constitutions, 
Northeastern  state  constitutions.  Seventeen percent  of the pre-1855  and 21%
of the post- 1855  constitutions  granted  this privilege.

6.  Privilege from  Arrest  (for Legislators).-Privileges from  criminal
process  or arrest  were  unsurprisingly  far more  common  in  state  constitutions
in  1868.  Twenty-nine  out  of thirty-seven  states-or  a three-quarters  Article

from arrest  during a  legislative  session (and  for  a designated time  period sur-
rounding  that  session).  These  clauses typically provided:

The  members  of  the  general  assembly  shall,  in  all  cases  except
treason,  felony, breach  or surety  of the peace,  be  privileged from  arrest
during  their attendance  at the  sessions  of their  respective  houses,  and
in  going  to and  returning  from  the  same;  and  for any  speech  or debate
in  either house,  they shall not be questioned  in any  other place.45 7

Seventy-eight  percent  of Americans  lived in  these  states.  The  privilege  was
found  in  92%  of  Midwestern-Western,  73%  of  Southern,  and  70%  of
Northeastern  state  constitutions.  Eighty-three  percent  of  the  pre-1855,
compared to  74%  of the  post-1855,  constitutions  protected  legislators  in this
manner.

7.  Inviolable Constitution.-In an effort to  guard  against  transgressions
of the  state  government,  four states-a minority--declared  that  everything  in
the  state  constitution  shall  remain  inviolate  and  that  all  laws  contrary  to  it
shall  be void.  A typical  such clause  stated, "To  guard against  transgressions
of the high  powers  herein delegated,  we  declare  that everything  in  this bill of
rights is excepted  out  of the general  powers  of government,  and  shall  forever
remain  inviolate;  and all  laws  contrary  thereto,  or  the  following  provisions,
shall  be  void. 458  Eighteen  percent  of the  population  in  1868  lived  in  states
with  such  provisions  in  their  constitutions.  Such  provisions  could  be  found
in  20%  of Southern  and  10%  of Northeastern  state  constitutions  and  not  in
any Midwestern-Western  state  constitutions.  Seventeen  percent  of the  pre-
1855  and 5% of the  post-1855  constitutions protected  this right.

8.  Uniform Government.-One state,  Virginia, provided  that the  people
have  a right  to  uniform  government,  and that  no  separate  government  within
the  limits  of the  state  ought  be  erected  or  established.  The  clause  read  as
follows:  "That the  people have a right  to uniform government;  and, therefore,
that  no  government  separate  from,  or  independent  of  the  government  of
Virginia,  ought  to  be  erected  or  established  within  the  limits  thereof. 4 59
Three  percent  of the population  lived in  Virginia  in  1868.  Virginia's  consti-
tution was  ratified  after  1855.  It is,  to  say the least,  ironic that it was  Virginia
that  had this  clause  in  its  state  constitution,  since  the  state  of West  Virginia
was  in  fact  carved  out  of  it,  by  perfectly  constitutional  means,  during  the
Civil  War.46°

P.  Affirmative Rights to a Public-School Education and to  Welfare

The  final  set of rights that we  found  in state  constitutions  in  1868  is in
many  ways the  most  important,  and  perhaps  the  most surprising.  We  found
that  an Article  V,  three-quarters  consensus  of the  thirty-seven  states  in  1868
recognized  a  fundamental  state  constitutional  duty to  provide  a public-school
education  as  a  matter of their  formal,  positive  state  constitutional  law.  The
existence  of such  a  duty  on government  could be  said to  create  a right on the
part  of individuals.  In Prigg v. Pennsylvania,46 1 the  Supreme  Court held that
the  individual  constitutional  right  of slave  owners  to  recover  fugitive  slaves
implied that the  federal  government  had the power  to pass  a federal  fugitive-
slave  law-a power not expressly  spelled  out in Article I, Section  8.462  Thus,
Justice  Story's  opinion  stood  for  the  proposition  that  an  individual  right  can
give rise  to government power, which is  far more  tenuous  than our claim  that
a  government  duty  to  educate  implies  an  individual  right  to  be  educated  at
public  expense.

A  right  to  a  public-school  education  is  thus  arguably  deeply  rooted  in
American  history  and  tradition  and  is  implicit  in  the  concept  of  ordered
liberty.  This  is  an  extraordinary  finding  because  of  its  implications  for
Brown v.  Board of Education, and  because  it  is  usually  argued that  a  distinc-
tive  feature  of  American  constitutionalism  is  that  it  guarantees  negative
liberties  against  government  but  not  positive  claims  for  entitlements  from
government.463  That  point  is  generally  true,  but  our  data  on  fundamental
state  constitutional  rights  in  1868  suggest  that there  may  be  at least  one  very
fundamental  positive-law  entitlement 
long
possessed.  In addition  to  finding  an Article  V consensus  that  Americans  had
a right  in  1868  to  a  public-school  education,  we  found  that  a  few  state  con-
stitutions  imposed  on  their  state  governments  an  obligation  to  run  certain
other  charitable  public  institutions.  There  was  not,  however,  a  widespread
public  consensus  on  that  matter  in  1868  the  way  there  was  a  widespread
public  consensus  on the states'  duty to provide  a public-school  education.

that  all  Americans  have 

1.  Duty to Provide a Public-School Education.-An astonishing  thirty-
six  out  of  thirty-seven 
three-quarters
consensus-imposed  a  duty  in  their  constitutions  on  state  government  to
provide  a  public-school  education.  We  think  it  is  fair  to  construe  these
clauses  as  in  effect guaranteeing  individuals  a right  to  some  kind  of govern-
ment  provision  of a public-school  education.  The  Supreme  Court  has  thus

Individual  Rights  Under State  Constitutions  in  1868

In  San  Antonio
far  rejected  the  notion  of  a  right  to  public  education. 
Independent School District v.  Rodriguez,464  the  Court  expressly  said  that
public education  is not  a fundamental  right.465  It  held:

is  not  among  the  rights  afforded  explicit
Education,  of  course, 
protection  under  our  federal  Constitution.  Nor  do  we  find  any  basis
for  saying  it  is  implicitly  so  protected.  As  we  have  said,  the  undis-
puted  importance  of  education  will  not  alone  cause  this  Court  to
depart  from  the  usual standard  for reviewing  a  State's  social  and eco-
nomic  legislation.

466

However,  the  Court has  also recognized  the importance  of education without
deeming  it  a  fundamental  right,  saying  instead  that  it  "has  a  pivotal  role  in
maintaining the  fabric  of our  society ' 467 and  is "the  most  important  function
of state  and local  governments.

,,468

Ninety-two  percent  of  all  Americans  in  1868  lived  in  states  whose
constitutions  imposed  this  duty  on  state  government.  Every  state  except
Illinois,  which had  a pre-1855  constitution,  had  a clause  imposing  a  duty  on
the state  government  to offer at least  some  kind of a  public-school  education.
A  typical  clause  of  this  kind  provided,  in  the  words  of  the  Mississippi
Constitution:

As  the  stability  of a  republican  form  of government  depends  mainly
upon  the  intelligence  and  virtue  of the  people,  it  shall  be  the  duty  of
the  legislature  to  encourage,  by  all  suitable  means,  the  promotion  of
intellectual,  scientific,  moral,  and  agricultural  improvement,  by  estab-
lishing  a  uniform  system  of  free  public  schools,  by  taxation  or
otherwise,  for  all  children  between  the  ages  of five  and  twenty-one
years,  and  shall,  as  soon  as  practicable,  establish  schools  of higher
grade.469

These  clauses  then  guaranteed  as  a  matter  of formal  positive  law  that  indi-
viduals  essentially  had  a  fundamental  right  to  obtain  a  public-school
education  if they  wanted  one.  The  clauses  in  question,  however,  did  not
make  school  attendance  compulsory  for  the  young,  so  parents  could  still
choose to  homeschool  their  children,  or possibly,  like  the  Amish,  to  not edu-
cate them  beyond  a  certain  minimal  level.  Notably,  South  Carolina  required
not  only  the  provision  of public  schools  but  also  compulsory  attendance.47 °
This was  an  exception.  The  issue  of compulsory  school  attendance  was one

that  was  generally  not  addressed  or resolved  in  1868,  despite  the  provisions
for public education.

This  finding  is  striking  because  it  could  be  argued  to  imply  that  a  right
to  a  public-school  education  in  1868  was  a  privilege  or  immunity  for
Fourteenth  Amendment  purposes  as  to  which  the  states  were  not  allowed  to
discriminate  on the basis  of race.  The  framers  and ratifiers  of the Fourteenth
Amendment  may  well  not  have  understood  that  the  Amendment  outlawed
segregation 
it  did.
Obviously,  it  is  the  formal  text  of the  Fourteenth  Amendment  that  governs,
and  not  the  uncodified  and  erroneous  ideas  of the  ratifiers  of that  text  as  to
what it might  mean.

in  education,  but  arguably 

is  precisely  what 

that 

Judge Michael  McConnell,  in  his  originalist  defense  of Brown v. Board
of Education, found  that  the  Congress  that  passed  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of
1875  came  close  to passing  federal  legislation  outlawing  segregation  in  state
public  schools  on  Fourteenth  Amendment  grounds.471  One  question  raised
by  McConnell's  brilliantly  defended  thesis  is  how  the  Congress  in  1875
could have  thought that  federal  legislation prohibiting  school segregation  was
the  rights  guaranteed  by  Section  One  of  the
appropriate  to  "enforce" 
Fourteenth  Amendment.  One  explanation  that  our  Article  supports  is  that
public-school  education  was  conceived  as  a  privilege  or  immunity  as  to
which class-based  legislation was  forbidden.

As 

it  happens, 

three  states  specifically  discussed  segregation 

in
education  in  their  state  constitutions-Missouri  permitted  it,472  and  South
Carolina  and Louisiana prohibited it. 473  Vermont's  state  constitutional clause
requiring  the  state  to  offer  a  public-school  education  was  slightly  weaker
than the  others.  It  stated  only that  "a  competent  number  of schools  ought to
be  maintained  in each  town., 474  North  Carolina's  state  constitutional  clause
on  public-school  education  was  particularly  strong,  calling  the  right  to

Individual  Rights  Under State  Constitutions  in  1868

education  a privilege and  placing  the clause  within the  Bill of Rights. 475  This
is  consistent  with  the  idea argued  for  above  that  this  right  was  a  privilege  or
immunity  as  to  which  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  forbade  the  making  of ra-
cial  classifications.  The  pervasiveness  in state  constitutional  law  in  1868  of a
right  to  a  public-school  education,  or  a  duty  of the  state  to  provide  a  free
education  to all  its  citizens,  is  striking because  we  have no such  right, at  least
explicitly,  in  our  federal  Constitution.  This  reflects  partly  the  fact  that  most
of our Constitution  was  drafted  in  the  eighteenth  century  and  partly  the  fact
that  education  was  originally  seen  as  being  a matter for the  states  and not  for
the  federal  government.  Some  scholars  have  argued  that  a  right  to  public
education  is  inherent  in  other  rights,  for  instance,  in  the  right  to  substantive
due  process. 
These  findings  may  support  such  claims,  although  they  do
not  necessarily  lead  to  the  conclusion  that  public  school  funding  must  be
equal.  If the  Supreme  Court  were  to  revisit  Rodriguez, it is  possible  that  the
overwhelming  presence  of  the  right  to  education  in  state  constitutions  in
1868  would  qualify  as  at  least  a  partial  "basis  for  saying  it  is  implicitly  so
protected.

2.  Other Affirmative  Rights  to  Government Aid.-Nine  states  out  of
thirty-seven  in  1868-a  minority-provided  in  their  state  constitutions  for
the  existence  of public  institutions,  provided  for and  supported  by  the  state,
to  aid some  of those  in  need.  A  typical  clause  provided,  "Institutions  for  the
benefit  of the  insane,  blind,  and  deaf and  dumb  shall  always  be  fostered  and
supported  by  the  State,  and  be  subject  to  such  regulations  as  may  be  pre-
scribed by  the  general  assembly. ''4 7 8  Note  that  this  clause  imposes  a duty  on
the  states  in  question  and  creates  an  affirmative  right  to  government  aid  on
the  part  of  the  insane,  blind,  deaf,  and  dumb.  Twenty-three  percent  of
Americans  living  in  1868-just  shy  of one-quarter  of the  population-lived
in  states  with  clauses  of this  type  in  their  state  constitutions.  Such  clauses
were  found  in  42%  of Midwestern-Western,  27%  of  Southern,  and  0%  of
Northeastern  state  constitutions.  They  were  present  in  17%  of the pre-1855
constitutions  and  in  32%  of the  post-1855  constitutions,  so  the  trend  toward
government  provision  of  positive  aid  was  already  noticeable  when  the
Fourteenth  Amendment  was  ratified  in  1868. 
In  addition,  Michigan  and
Wisconsin  (the  former  also included  a clause  on public  institutions  generally)
required  that  the  legislature  provide  for  the  establishment  of  free  public

libraries. 479   Louisiana  went  further,  making  it  the  duty  of  the  general
assembly  to  oblige  parishes  to  support  all  paupers  residing  within  their
limits. 480  This  is  the  only  state  constitution  we  found  in  1868  that  could  be
argued  to  create  a  right  to  welfare. 
It  is  interesting,  but  not  surprising,  that
such  a  right would  have  existed  in the only civil  law  state  in the  country.  The
civil  law,  with its  ties to the  Catholic  Church,  is  generally  less  libertarian  and
more  paternalistic  than  the  common  law. 481  The  subject  of whether  the  fed-
eral  Constitution  created a  right  to  welfare  was  a major topic  of discussion  in
the  1960s and  1970s.482

V.  Discussion

We  have  now  completed  our long  and  winding  tour of the  individual
rights protected  as  a matter  of state  constitutional  law in  1868.  We have  seen
that almost  all  of the  provisions  of the  federal  Bill  of Rights,  and  other  ana-
logs  to  it  in  other  parts  of the  federal  Constitution,  were  protected  by  state
constitutions  in  1868.  In addition,  state  constitutions  explicitly protect  some
important  rights,  such  as  the  right  to a public-school  education, that  were not
protected in  1868 by the  federal  Constitution.  One purpose of our nose count
or  tally  of states,  as  we  said  in the  Introduction,  was  to  help  determine  how
fundamental,  or  deeply rooted,  or  implicit  in  the  concept  of ordered  liberty a
right  really  is  as  revealed  by  state  constitutional  law  in  1868.  This  arguably
is  relevant 
to  debates  about  the  original  meaning  of  the  Fourteenth
Amendment  or  the  contours  of modem  substantive  due  process.  The  charts
above  reveal  that thirty-one  rights-related  provisions  that  we  separately  iden-
tified  were  recognized  by  an  Article  V  consensus  of three-quarters  of the
states  in  1868  when  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  Privileges  or  Immunities

2008]

Individual  Rights Under  State Constitutions  in  1868

Clause  was  ratified.  Another  eleven  individual-rights-related  provisions
were  recognized  by  a  supermajority  of two-thirds  of the  states  in  their  1868
positive-law  state  constitutions, which  gives those  rights a  claim to  the  status
of being  fundamental  rights as  well.  An  additional  eleven  rights-related pro-
visions were  recognized  and  protected  by  a majority  of state  constitutions  in
1868.  Three-quarters  of all  Americans  living  in  1868 lived  in  states that rec-
ognized  twenty-eight  of the  rights-related  provisions  we  discussed,  and  two-
thirds  of Americans  lived  in  states  that  recognized  another  ten of the  rights-
related  provisions.  Substantial  supermajorities  of Americans  thus  lived  in
states  in  1868  that  recognized  an  astonishing  thirty-eight  individual  rights-
related provisions  in their positive  state  constitutional  law.  American culture
in  1868  was  thickly  populated  by  the  protection  of individual  fundamental
rights.  An  additional  fifteen  rights-related  provisions  beyond  these  thirty-
eight  were  enshrined  by  constitutions  governing  a  majority  of  Americans
living in  1868.

Many  of the  most  common  state  constitutional  rights,  for  example,  the
right of free  speech  and  the  right  to  petition  for  habeas  corpus,  are  also  pro-
tected by  the  federal  Constitution.  However,  some interesting  discrepancies
emerged as  well.  For instance, only  a majority  and not a  supermajority of the
states  (and of the total  population) had,  in  effect, a  right  to bear arms  or to be
free  from  the  imposition  of religious  qualifications  for  office.  This  number
arguably  changes  if one  counts  clauses  allowing  people  abstractly  a  right  to
defend  their  liberty  and property.  Conversely,  an  Article V,  three-quarters
consensus  of  the  states  (and  population)  had  a  right  to  a  public-school
education-a  right  that  is  not  explicitly  found  anywhere 
in  the  federal
Constitution.  This  right  is an  implication  of the  duty  state  constitutions  im-
posed  on  their  legislatures  to  provide  all  children  a  free  public-school
education.  Patterns  and  divergences  like  these  were  abundant.  Specific
findings  and  implications  are  discussed  above  for  each  of  the  individual
rights  and  limitations.  This  Part  will  provide  a  broader,  though  inevitably
noncomprehensive,  discussion  of the  most striking  results.

Professor  Akhil  Reed  Amar's  exceptional  and  well-received  book,
The Bill of Rights: Creation and Reconstruction, offers  an excellent  medium
through  which  to  showcase  the  significance  of our  findings. 
In  his  book,
Amar  first  gives  a  thorough  narrative  of the  history  and  meaning  of  each
Amendment  in  our Bill  of Rights.483  He  next argues that,  as  an original  mat-
ter  in  1791, 
the  rights  protected  by  the  Bill  of  Rights  had  a  far  more
collective meaning  than the libertarian,  individualistic  meaning they  acquired
in  1868  when  the  Fourteenth Amendment  was  ratified.484  We  think Amar is
exactly  right  that  for  those  wondering  about 
incorporation  or  judicial

protection  against  the  states  of unenumerated  rights  in  federal  constitutional
law,  the  question  is  controlled  not  by  the  original  meaning  of the  first  ten
Amendments 
in  1791  but  instead  by  the  meaning  those  texts  and  the
Fourteenth  Amendment  had  in  1868.485  Our  Article  here  builds  on  this
critical  theme  of Amar's  by offering  a descriptive  account  of what  individual
rights  were  thought  to  be  truly  fundamental  in  1868  as  a  matter  of positive
state  constitutional  law.  We  express  no  opinion  here  on  Amar's  claim  that
the  Fourteenth  Amendment  literally  incorporates  the federal  Bill of Rights  so
that it applies  against the  states.486  Amar makes  a powerful  case, but  that is a
subject  for  another  time.  We  do  claim  that  something  very  much  like  the
selective  incorporation  of the  Bill  of Rights  that  has  actually  occurred  as  a
matter  of Fourteenth  Amendment  substantive  due  process  can  be  explained
and justified  by  asking  what  rights  were  fundamental  and  deeply  rooted  in
history  and tradition  as  a  matter of state  constitutional  law  in  1868.  On  this
question,  we  reach  largely  the  same  results  as  Amar,  although  for  different
reasons.

Amar  argues  that  there  are  roughly  two  types  of rights:  those  that
address  agency  and  populism problems  (henceforth  referred  to  as  "collective
rights")  and  those  that  are  antimajoritarian  and  individualistic  (henceforth
referred  to  as  "individualistic  rights").4 87  He  proposes  that  some  of  the
clauses  of the  federal  Bill  of Rights,  such  as  the  Establishment  Clause,  were
originally  meant  to  protect  a  collective  right.488  Amar  argues,  correctly  in
our view,  that  the  Establishment  Clause  was  meant to permit states to  estab-
lish religions  and that  it only  protected  the  state-established  churches  from  a
federally  established  church. 489  Amar  thus  concludes  that  it would  make  no
more  sense to  incorporate  a  states-rights  clause  like the  federal  Establishment
Clause  against  the  states  than it would  make  sense to  so  incorporate  the  fed-
eral  Tenth  Amendment. 490  This  point  obviously  has  important  implications
for the  theory  of incorporation,  and indeed  it leads  Amar to  propose his  own
theory  of "refined  incorporation., 491  Essentially,  Amar's  theory  of refined

485.  See  id. at  234-35  (recounting  the  broad  conception  of freedom  of speech  popularized  in
the  decades  leading  up  to  the  adoption  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  as  a  determinant  of what
rights  are  protected  by  the  Amendment  against  states'  intrusion).  Kurt  Lash  rightly  refers  to this
transformation  as the  "second  adoption."  See Lash,  supra note  61,  at  1109  ("This Article  explores
the  proposition  that the  Free  Exercise  Clause  was  adopted  a  second  time  through  its  incorporation
into  the  Privileges  or  Immunities  Clause  of the  Fourteenth  Amendment  and  that  the  scope  of the
new  Free Exercise  Clause  was  intended to  include  protections unanticipated  at  the Founding.").

486.  See  AMAR,  supra note  44,  at  174  (asserting  the  correctness  of  Hugo  Black's  contention

that the text of the  Fourteenth  Amendment applies the  Bill  of Rights to  the states).

487.  See id. at xiv-xv  (postulating  a  basic  distinction  in the  Bill of Rights between  majoritarian
and  populist  "republican  political  'right[s]  of  the  people,"'  and  libertarian  provisions  conferring

Individual  Rights Under  State Constitutions  in  1868

incorporation  calls  on the  Supreme  Court to code  every  sentence  or clause  of
the  original  federal  Constitution  of  1787  and  its  twenty-seven  Amendments
to  determine  whether the  sentence  or  clause  in  question  protects  a collective
or  an  individual  right.492  If the  right  protected  by  the  clause  in  question  is
collective,  and  concerns  the  self-governance  of states,  Amar  argues  it  ought
not to  be  incorporated  by the  Fourteenth Amendment  against  the  states. 493  If
the right in  question,  however,  is an  individualistic  right, then  Amar argues  it
can  and  should be  incorporated  against  the  states.494  Amar's  refined  theory
of incorporation  thus  allows  for  acknowledgement  that  some  rights  in  the
federal  Constitution  and  Bill  of  Rights  are  states'  rights  and  some  are
individuals'  rights.495  Only the  latter, and  not the  former, can  be repacked  as
being  among  the  "privileges  and  immunities"  of American  citizens  that  are
protected  by  the  Fourteenth  Amendment.496  Amar's  theory  is  attractively
crisp,  and  it explains and legitimizes  the  Supreme Court's  messy  substantive-
due-process  incorporation  case  law.

in  effect 

in  1868. 

The  contribution  our  historical  study  could  be  argued  to  make  to  this
constitutional  debate  is  as  follows:  Many of the  rights that Amar  identifies  as
collective-such  as  the  rights  protected  by  the  federal  Establishment  Clause,
the  Tenth  Amendment,  and  the  Second  Amendment  right  to  keep  and  bear
arms-were  also  found  in  many,  and  in  some  cases  in  most,  of the  thirty-
seven  state  constitutions  that  were 
In  those  state
constitutions,  the  rights  to  be  free  of an  established  church  or  to  own  guns
were clearly  individual  rights of citizens  according  to  state  constitutional  law
in  1868  and  not merely  collective rights.  In fact,  Amar has  already  acknowl-
edged the  existence  of some  of these  state  analogs  and,  as  a  result,  softened
his position.497  He  has conceded,  for example,  that the  presence  of establish-
ment  clauses  in  state  constitutions  may  make  nonestablishment  a  "soft
substantive  rule"  (although  not a full privilege  or immunity).498  Our compre-
hensive  chronicle  of rights  exposes  other  instances  of states  turning  federal
constitutional  collective  rights of states  into individual  rights  against  the gov-
ernment  instead.  This  could be  argued  to  shed  light on the  original  meaning
of the Fourteenth  Amendment.

492.  See id. at xiv  ("[A]1l  of the  privileges  and immunities  of citizens  recognized  in  the  Bill of
Rights  became  'incorporated'  against  states  by  dint  of the  Fourteenth  Amendment.  But  not  all  of
the  provisions  of the  original  Bill  of Rights  were  indeed  rights  of citizens.  Some  instead  were  at
least  in part  rights of states  ....

Texas  Law  Review

[Vol.  87:7

In addition  to  collective  rights  of states  and  rights of individual  citizens,
our  amended  Constitution  protects  another  type  of rights:  structural  rights,
such as the right  not to have  a federal  statute  suspended or dispensed  with by
the  President  acting  alone.  Amar does  not  consider structural  constitutional
rights  of  this  kind  to  be  individual  freedoms  to  be  incorporated  by  the
Fourteenth  Amendment. 499   He  believes  that  "[t]he  right  question  is  not
whether  a clause  is  fundamental  but  whether  it  is truly  a  private  right  of the
citizen  rather  than  a  right  of the  states  or  the  public  generally., 500  But  our
findings  could most definitely  be  used to  challenge Amar's  narrow  definition
of individualistic  rights.  We  found  that  many  states  mimicked  some  of the
most  important  of the  structural  guarantees  of the  federal  Constitution;  such
guarantees  could, in specific  cases  or  controversies,  provide a cause  of action
to  an  individual  litigant.  For  example,  an  Article  V  consensus  of three-
quarters  of the  states  provided  for  the  division  of  government  into  three
separate  departments-the  executive,  the judicial,  and  the  legislative.  This
would confer  on individuals  a  right  not to be proceeded  against  by  a govern-
ment  official  who  was  simultaneously  both  prosecutor  and  judge.  That
occurrence  would  be  a  forbidden  intermixture  of the  executive  and judicial
powers.  An Article  V  consensus  of three-quarters  of the  states  in  1868  rec-
ognized  a  right  not  to  have  a  statute  one  is  relying  upon  suspended  or
dispensed  with  by  the  executive  in  cases  where  the  individual  is  being  pro-
ceeded  against  by  the  executive  in  violation  of statutory  law. 50 1  Thus,  over
three-quarters  of the  1868  state  constitutions  contained  take-care  clauses  re-
quiring  that  the  governor  take  care  that  the  laws  be  faithfully  executed.  A
convincing  claim could be made  that the  "right"  to  have  a governor  who  can-
not  suspend  or dispense  with  the  law  is  not meaningfully  different  from  the
"right"  to due  process  before  a court  before  being  deprived of life,  liberty,  or
property.  Both  take-care-clause  rights  and  due-process-clause  rights  are
deeply  rooted  in  our  history  and  tradition-a  point  Amar  may  have
overlooked.

One of our intriguing  findings  is arguably  quite  central  to Amar's  work:
evidence  that  state  positive  constitutional  law  in  1868  openly  contemplated
the  existence  of at  least  some  unenumerated  fundamental,  natural,  and  in-
alienable  rights  beyond  all  the  many  positive-law  rights  catalogued  in  this
Article.  A  right  to  privacy  in  sexual  matters  of  the  kind  found  by  the
Supreme  Court  in  Griswold v.  Connecticut50 2  or Lawrence v.  Texas503  could

were  indeed  privileges  of  individuals  (for  example,  habeas)  and  which  were  instead  structural
provisions  unique  to  the  federal  government  and  inappropriate  for  imposition  on  the  states  (for
example, capitation  and bicameralism)").

500.  Id. at 222.
501.  Note  that  there  is  no  individual  right  to  force  the  executive  to  execute  the  law  by
prosecuting  someone  else, a situation  that should  be clearly  distinguished from  the  one  governed  by
the take-care  clauses.

Individual  Rights Under  State  Constitutions  in  1868

arguably be  such a right.  Clearly,  not even a  single  state  in  1868  protected  a
right  to  privacy  in  its  state  constitution.  But  if those  constitutions  protected
natural-law  rights,  and  if the  right  to  privacy  is  a  natural-law  right,  then
maybe  constitutional  recognition  of natural-law  rights  is  itself deeply  rooted
in  our  history  and  tradition.  This  conclusion  suggests  that  the  Supreme
Court's  attempts  in  Washington v.  Glucksberg and Michael H. v.  Gerald D.
to  cabin the  right to  privacy  by  limiting  it to  only  those  unenumerated  rights
that  are  deeply  rooted  in  American  history  and  tradition  may be  doomed  to
fail.  If recognition  of natural-law  unenumerated  rights is  itself deeply  rooted
in  American  history  and  tradition,  then  following  Glucksberg simply  leads
one  back to  the question of what is  a natural and inalienable  right.  Of course,
Justice  Scalia  or  Judge  Bork  might  legitimately  respond that  just because  a
lot  of states  in  1868  recognized  the  existence  of natural-law  rights  does  not
mean  that  they  thought  courts  ought  to  recognize  or  enforce  those  rights

constitutional  baby  Ninth  Amendments  were  understood  in  1868  as  endors-
ing the existence  of natural law.

One other point  on which we  and Amar agree  is that we have  found  that
positive  state  constitutional  laws  in  1868  were not  so  much  efforts  to  create
and legislate  the  existence  of individual  fundamental  rights  as they  were  ef-

individual  rights  are  preexisting
entitlements,  and are  simply  "declared"  or "acknowledged"  or "recognized"
by  our  constitutions,  bills  of rights,  and  laws.  Whether  and to  what  degree
those  rights  or  other  unmentioned  rights  "like"  them  were  meant to  be judi-
cially  enforceable  or  discoverable  is  a  question  that  goes  well  beyond  the
scope  of this Article.  We  do  think, however,  that we  have  helped  nail  down
more  clearly  which  rights  are  and which  rights  are  not  deeply  rooted in  our
history  and tradition.

VI.  Conclusion

Our  goal  here  has been  to  stay  as  far  away  from  normative  claims  as
we  can manage  and  to  simply  positively  describe  the  protections  afforded  to
individuals  by  positive  state  constitutional  law  in  1868.  There  is  a  huge
amount  of  normative  writing  and 
the  Fourteenth
Amendment  and  precious 
that  provides  a  descriptive
account  of  some  of  the  rights  that  normative  scholars  have  said  the
Amendment  might  protect.  Normative  scholarship  in  this  area  is  both

essential  and  fraught  with  risks.  We  think  it helpful  to  stand  back,  hold  our
breath,  and simply  collect,  group,  and count  the  positive  state  constitutional
rights  that were  in place  in  1868.  That is why we  chose  here to  collect all  the
individual  rights  that  were  recognized  in  state  constitutional  law  in  1868,
when  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  was  ratified,  and  group  them  together  to
display the  story  of rights  protection  they  tell.  Remarkably  strong  and con-
sistent  patterns  emerge,  creating  what  we  hope  will  prove  to  be  a  rich  and
valuable  data  set in the  ongoing judicial  discovery  and  subsequent  protection
of our fundamental  individual  rights.
