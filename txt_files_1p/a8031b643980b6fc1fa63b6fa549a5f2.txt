Question!
On page 149, 150 the author argues for the expected-value account according to the Rational 
risk aversion- example of an outcome of zero as expected value. His ﬁrst reason considers risk 
and the agent’s relationship to good and bad outcomes to be controversial. His advice is to stick 
to the probability as long as ‘irrelevant’ factors are not proven to be relevant.!
Well in the case that an expected value is zero and no relevant factors must be considered how 
can the expected-value-based approach hold account for a good framework ?
