To  determine   whether   child   maltreatment   has   a  long-term   impact   on  emotion   processing
abilities   in   adulthood   and   whether   IQ,   psychopathology,   or   psychopathy   mediate   the   rela-
tionship  between   childhood   maltreatment   and   emotion   processing   in   adulthood.   Using
a  prospective   cohort   design,   children   (ages   0–11)   with   documented   cases   of   abuse   and
neglect   during   1967–1971   were   matched   with   non-maltreated   children   and   followed   up
into  adulthood.   Potential   mediators   (IQ,   Post-Traumatic   Stress   [PTSD],   Generalized   Anx-
iety  [GAD],   Dysthymia,   and   Major   Depressive   [MDD]   Disorders,   and   psychopathy)   were
assessed   in   young   adulthood   with   standardized   assessment   techniques.   In   middle   adult-
hood  (Mage =  47),   the   International   Affective   Picture   System   was   used   to  measure   emotion
processing.   Structural   equation   modeling   was  used   to  test   mediation   models.   Individuals
with   a  history   of  childhood   maltreatment   were   less   accurate   in   emotion   processing   overall
and  in   processing   positive   and   neutral   pictures   than   matched   controls.   Childhood   physical
abuse  predicted   less   accuracy   in   neutral   pictures   and   childhood   sexual   abuse   and   neglect
predicted   less   accuracy   in   recognizing   positive   pictures.   MDD,   GAD,   and   IQ  predicted   over-
all   picture   recognition   accuracy.   However,   of   the   mediators   examined,   only   IQ   acted   to
mediate  the  relationship   between   child   maltreatment   and   emotion   processing   deﬁcits.
Although   research   has   focused   on   emotion   processing   in   maltreated   children,   these   new
ﬁndings   show   an   impact   child   abuse   and   neglect   on  emotion   processing   in   middle   adult-
hood.   Research   and  interventions   aimed   at   improving   emotional   processing   deﬁciencies   in
abused  and   neglected   children   should   consider   the   role   of   IQ.

A  key  component  of  social  competence  is  emotion  processing,  which  includes  emotion  perception,  communication,  inter-
pretation,  and  regulation  of  emotion  (Halberstadt,  Denham,  &  Dunsmore,  2001).  Emotions  function  to  provide  information
about  the  environment  and  prepare  for  a  behavioral  response,  triggering  the  appetitive  or  defensive  systems,  depending  on
the  situation  (Bradley,  Codispoti,  Cuthbert,  &  Lang,  2001).  Theories  of  emotion  suggest  that  behavioral  responses  to  emotions
are  directly  related  to  emotion  processing  (Halberstadt  et  al.,  2001).  This  paper  brings  together  research  on  child  maltreat-
ment,  emotional  development,  and  psychopathology  to  examine  the  consequences  of  child  abuse  and  neglect  for  emotion
processing  in  adulthood.

Childhood  maltreatment  and  emotion  processing

In  general,  child  maltreatment  has  been  found  to  disrupt  the  normal  process  of  emotional  development.  First,  studies
of  maltreating  parents  suggest  that  they  show  less  positive  emotion  and  more  negative  emotion  than  non-abusive  parents
(Bugental,  Blue,  &  Lewis,  1990;  Kavanagh,  Youngblade,  Reid,  &  Fagot,  1988).  It  is  also  believed  that  maltreating  parents  tend
to  be  isolated  themselves  and  to  isolate  their  children  from  interaction  with  others,  providing  fewer  nonparental  models  of
emotional  communication  (Salzinger,  Feldman,  Hammer,  &  Rosario,  1993).

Second,  a  child  who  receives  inconsistent  or  harsh  caregiving  has  difﬁculty  predicting  the  consequences  of  his/her  behav-
ior  (Dadds  &  Salmon,  2003)  and  this  may   be  manifest  in  deﬁcits  in  processing  emotional  information.  For  example,  maltreated
children  have  been  found  to  show  speciﬁc  deﬁcits  in  understanding  (Shipman  &  Zeman,  1999),  recognizing  (Pollak,  Cicchetti,
Hornug,  &  Reed,  2000),  and  expressing  emotion  (Gaensbauer,  1982)  and  are  at  risk  for  exhibiting  social  delays  (Kim  &
Cicchetti,  2010),  deﬁcits  in  empathy  (Beeghly  &  Cicchetti,  1994),  and  decreased  engagement  in  prosocial  behavior  (Koenig,
Cicchetti,  &  Rogosch,  2004).  These  ﬁndings  reveal  general  deﬁcits  in  emotion  processing  in  maltreated  children,  but  the
question  remains  about  whether  these  deﬁcits  would  persist  into  adulthood.

Using  tests  of  facial  emotion  recognition  (FER),  Pollak  and  Sinha  (2002)  found  that  children  with  physical  abuse  histories
were  better  able  to  identify  facial  displays  of  anger  compared  to  controls.  Several  other  studies  using  event-related  potentials
and  behavioral  evidence  have  found  a  sensitivity  bias  to  perceive  anger  in  physically  abused  children  (Pollak  &  Sinha,  2002;
Pollak,  Vardi,  Pultzer-Bechner,  &  Curtin,  2005;  Shackman,  Shackman,  &  Pollak,  2007)  and,  more  generally,  in  a  sample  of
maltreated  children  (Curtis  &  Cicchetti,  2011,  2013;  Leist  &  Dadds,  2009;  Masten  et  al.,  2008;  Pollak,  Klorman,  Brumaghim,
&  Cicchetti,  2001).  In  an  attempt  to  explain  these  ﬁndings,  Pollak  et  al.  (2005)  suggested  that  in  abusive  home  environments
children  learn  to  associate  anger  with  threat  of  harm  and  therefore,  they  are  hypervigilant  to  anger  in  their  environment.
Masten  et  al.  (2008)  elaborated  on  this  theory  to  suggest  that  maltreated  children  become  better  prepared  to  identify  threat-
ening  situations  through  hypervigilance  of  emotions.  For  example,  these  children  may   be  more  sensitive  to  anger  in  their
abuser  and  fear  of  those  around  them  because  both  sensitivities  could  help  them  identify  threat  quickly  and  potentially  avoid
additional  abuse  (Masten  et  al.,  2008).  Consistent  with  these  theories,  Shackman  et  al.  (2007)  have  shown  that  maltreated
children  show  enhanced  selective  attention  to  angry  facial  expressions  posed  by  their  mothers.  Thus,  this  body  of  research
would  suggest  that  individuals  with  histories  of  childhood  physical  abuse  might  be  less  likely  to  show  deﬁcits  in  processing
negative  emotional  pictures  and  more  likely  to  show  deﬁcits  for  pictures  with  positive  or  neutral  valence.

Very  little  research  has  examined  emotion  recognition  in  neglected  children.  In  earlier  research,  Bousha  and  Twentyman
(1984)  found  that  neglecting  parents  were  less  expressive  and  engaged  with  little  exchange  of  affective  information  in  inter-
actions  with  their  children  and,  thus,  provided  less  support  in  learning  to  understand  emotions  more  generally.  Impoverished
social  and  emotional  environments,  which  are  often  present  in  cases  of  neglect,  prevent  the  development  of  normal  emo-
tional  skills  (Pollak  et  al.,  2000)  and  may   cause  a  blunted  pattern  of  emotional  reactivity  (Gilles,  Berntson,  Zipf,  &  Gunnar,
2000;  van  der  Vegt,  van  der  Ende,  Kirschbaum,  Verhulst,  &  Tiemeier,  2009).  Pollak  et  al.  (2000)  reported  that  neglected
children  had  more  difﬁculty  in  recognizing  emotional  expressions  in  a  vignette  than  a  control  group  or  physically  abused
children.  When  rating  the  similarity  between  facial  expressions  of  different  emotions,  neglected  children  saw  fewer  distinc-
tions  between  emotions  compared  to  the  other  two   groups  (Pollak  et  al.,  2000).  However,  this  is  the  only  study  to  investigate
emotion  perception  deﬁcits  speciﬁc  to  neglected  children.  Most  studies  have  included  only  physically  abused  children  or
maltreated  children  (i.e.  physically  abused  and/or  neglected  children).  To  our  knowledge,  no  studies  have  focused  on  sexually
abused  children,  and  the  existing  literature  is  based  almost  exclusively  on  studies  of  children,  with  no  research  investigating
the  long-term  effects  of  childhood  abuse  and  neglect  on  adult  emotion  processing  ability.

Potential  mechanisms  linking  childhood  maltreatment  and  emotion  processing

If  the  impact  of  child  abuse  and  neglect  on  emotion  processing  extends  into  adulthood,  what  might  be  some  of  mecha-
nisms  that  lead  to  these  outcomes?  Research  has  increasingly  shown  that  childhood  abuse  and  neglect  can  result  in  a  cascade
of  negative  consequences  across  multiple  domains  of  functioning  (Gilbert  et  al.,  2009;  Widom,  2000)  that  might  explain  an
increased  risk  for  deﬁcits  in  emotion  processing  abilities  for  individuals  with  histories  of  child  abuse  and/or  neglect.  Specif-
ically,  child  abuse  and  neglect  has  been  associated  with  cognitive  deﬁcits  in  general  and  various  forms  of  psychopathology
that  may   lead  to  emotion  processing  deﬁcits.

First,  several  studies  have  reported  that  abused  and  neglected  children  are  at  increased  risk  for  lower  academic  perfor-
mance  and  intelligence  in  childhood  (Eckenrode,  Laird,  &  Doris  1993;  Jonson-Reid,  Drake,  Kim,  Porterﬁeld,  &  Han,  2004;
Lansford  et  al.,  2002)  and  that  these  effects  of  childhood  maltreatment  extend  into  young  adulthood  (Perez  &  Widom,  1994).
Thus,  it  is  possible  that  deﬁcits  in  intelligence  lead  to  general  deﬁcits  in  performance  on  processing  tasks,  particularly  those
that  involve  memory,  and  this  ﬁnding  may   help  explain  why  maltreated  children  perform  worse  on  these  tasks.

It  is  also  possible  that  some  of  the  psychological  consequences  that  have  been  associated  with  child  abuse  and  neglect
have  a  negative  impact  on  performance  on  emotion  processing  tasks  in  adulthood.  For  example,  individuals  with  histories  of
abuse  have  been  found  to  exhibit  more  symptoms  of  anxiety  disorders  (Springer,  Sheridan,  Kuo,  &  Carnes,  2007).  A  separate
body  of  research  reveals  that  individuals  with  higher  levels  of  anxiety  symptoms  show  deﬁcits  in  emotion  perception  (Mogg
&  Bradley,  1999)  and  emotion  regulation  (Suveg,  Morelen,  Brewer,  &  Thomassin,  2010),  and  individuals  with  PTSD  have
shown  an  attentional  bias  to  trauma-related  stimuli  (Buckley,  Blanchard,  &  Neill,  2000).  In  work  by  Pollak  et  al.  (2001),

certain  emotional  cues  become  salient  indicators  of  threat.  Thus,  in  an  emotion  processing  task,  highly  anxious  individuals
might  be  more  likely  to  perform  poorly  on  emotion  processing  tasks.

Childhood  maltreatment  has  also  been  associated  with  increased  risk  for  depression  (Cannon,  Bonomi,  Anderson,  Rivara,
&  Thompson,  2010;  Springer  et  al.,  2007;  Widom,  DuMont,  &  Czaja,  2007).  In  turn,  a  separate  body  of  research  suggests
that  individuals  with  depression  exhibit  deﬁcits  in  regulating  emotions  (Joormann,  Siemer,  &  Gotlib,  2007)  and  perceiving
emotion  in  others  (Stuhrmann,  Suslow,  &  Dannlowski,  2011).  Therefore,  it  is  possible  that  maltreated  children  may   have
difﬁculty  recognizing  emotions  as  a  function  of  higher  levels  of  depression  (Eberhart,  Auerbach,  Bigda-Peyton,  &  Abela,
2011).

At  present,  it  is  unclear  whether  the  association  between  child  maltreatment  and  deﬁcits  in  processing  of  emotion
would  persist,  independent  of  the  effects  of  psychopathology.  In  one  of  the  few  studies  to  address  this  issue,  Masten  et  al.
(2008)  focused  on  how  PTSD  might  relate  to  maltreated  children’s  processing  of  emotions  and  found  that  maltreated  chil-
dren  displayed  a  heightened  ability  (faster  reaction  time  compared  to  controls)  to  identify  fearful  faces,  independent  of
PTSD  diagnosis.  These  ﬁndings  with  children  suggest  that  maltreatment  is  uniquely  related  to  emotion  processing  deﬁcits,
regardless  of  PTSD  symptomatology.

In  addition  to  internalizing  consequences  of  child  abuse  and  neglect,  there  is  also  a  body  of  research  that  has  linked  child-
hood  maltreatment  to  externalizing  traits,  including  antisocial  behavior  and  psychopathy  (Bernstein,  Stein,  &  Handelsman,
1998;  Kolla  et  al.,  2013;  Lang,  Klinteberg,  &  Alm,  2002;  Weiler  &  Widom,  1996).  A  number  of  studies  have  also  reported  emo-
tion  processing  deﬁcits  in  individuals  with  antisocial  and  psychopathic  traits  (Blair,  Peschardt,  Budhani,  Mitchell,  &  Pine,
2006),  including  deﬁcits  in  empathy  (Blair,  1995),  experiencing  of  emotion  (Blair  et  al.,  2006;  Frick,  Lilienfeld,  Ellis,  Loney,  &
Silverthorn,  1999),  and  identifying  emotional  expressions  (Blair  et  al.,  2004;  Deeley  et  al.,  2006;  Iria  &  Barbosa,  2009;  Pham
&  Philippot,  2010).  Antisocial  individuals  have  been  found  to  show  speciﬁc  deﬁcits  in  perceiving  negative  emotions  in  facial
expressions  and  to  be  less  accurate  in  identifying  emotions  of  fear  or  sadness  than  emotions  of  happiness  or  surprise  (Blair,
Colledge,  Murray,  &  Mitchell,  2001;  Nichols,  2001).  Maltreated  children  may   show  emotion  processing  deﬁcits  in  adulthood
through  higher  levels  of  psychopathic  traits,  reﬂecting  greater  desensitization,  less  empathy,  or  less  responsiveness  to  the
needs  of  others  (Weiler  &  Widom,  1996),  critical  characteristics  of  psychopaths.  In  sum,  there  are  a  number  of  plausible
mechanisms  that  might  explain  deﬁcits  in  emotional  processing  in  adults  with  histories  of  childhood  abuse  and  neglect  and
warrant  investigation.

Speciﬁc  aims  and  hypotheses

This  study  has  several  aims.  The  ﬁrst  goal  is  to  assess  emotion  processing  abilities  in  individuals  with  documented  histories

of  childhood  abuse  and  neglect  and  a  matched  control  group  who  have  been  followed  up  into  adulthood.

Hypothesis  1.  Participants  with  a  history  of  childhood  maltreatment  will  be  less  accurate  overall  in  recognizing  affective
pictures  than  controls,  suggesting  general  deﬁcits  in  processing  emotional  cues.

The  second  aim  is  to  determine  whether  these  emotion  processing  deﬁcits  vary  by  types  of  childhood  maltreatment
(physical  and  sexual  abuse  and  neglect)  and  by  emotional  valance  (positive,  negative,  or  neutral).  However,  given  the  dearth
of  literature  on  the  topic,  no  speciﬁc  predictions  are  made  about  children  who   have  been  sexually  abused.

Hypothesis  2.  Based  on  earlier  work  suggesting  that  children  growing  up  in  abusive  home  environments  will  learn  to
associate  anger  with  threat  of  harm  (Pollak  et  al.,  2005),  it  is  hypothesized  that  victims  of  childhood  physical  abuse  will
be  more  accurate  in  recognizing  negative  images  (that  is,  physically  abused  children  will  not  differ  from  controls),  but  less
accurate  in  recognizing  positive  and  neutral  images,  than  matched  controls.

Hypothesis  3.  As  a  result  of  their  impoverished  social  and  emotional  environments,  it  is  predicted  that  neglected  children
will  be  less  accurate  in  recognizing  negative  and  positive  images  (emotionally  valenced  pictures)  than  controls.

A  ﬁnal  aim  is  to  examine  whether  the  associations  between  childhood  maltreatment  and  deﬁcits  in  emotion  processing
abilities  are,  in  part,  a  function  of  consequences  of  child  maltreatment,  speciﬁcally,  IQ,  psychopathology  (Generalized  Anxiety
Disorder,  PTSD,  Dysthymia,  and  Major  Depressive  Disorder),  and  psychopathy  or  whether  deﬁcits  are  independent  of  these
forms  of  psychopathology.

Hypothesis  4. 
child  abuse  and  neglect  and  emotion  processing  accuracy.

It  is  hypothesized  that  IQ,  psychopathology,  and  psychopathy  will  each  mediate  the  relationship  between

Methods

Overview

The  data  used  here  are  from  a  prospective  cohort  design  study  in  which  abused  and  neglected  children  were  matched  with
non-abused,  non-neglected  children  and  followed  into  young  adulthood.  Because  of  the  matching  procedure,  the  participants
are  assumed  to  differ  only  in  the  risk  factor  (i.e.,  having  experienced  childhood  sexual  or  physical  abuse  or  neglect).  Because  it
is  not  possible  to  assign  participants  to  groups  randomly,  the  assumption  of  equivalency  for  the  groups  is  an  approximation.

The  control  group  may   also  differ  from  the  abused  and  neglected  individuals  on  other  variables  associated  with  abuse  or
neglect.  (For  complete  details  of  the  study  design  and  subject  selection  criteria,  see  Widom,  1989a.)

The  initial  phase  of  the  study  compared  the  abused  and/or  neglected  children  to  the  matched  comparison  group  (N  =  1,575)
on  juvenile  and  adult  criminal  arrest  records  (Widom,  1989a,b).  The  second  phase  involved  tracking,  locating,  and  interview-
ing  both  groups  during  1989–1995,  approximately  22  years  after  incidents  of  abuse  and  neglect  (N  =  1,196).  This  interview
consisted  of  a  series  of  structured  and  semi-structured  questionnaires  and  rating  scales,  including  the  National  Institute  of
Mental  Health  (NIMH)  Diagnostic  Interview  Schedule  –  Revised  (DIS-III-R),  a  standardized  psychiatric  assessment  that  yields
Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders  (DSM-III-R)  diagnoses  (Robins,  Helzer,  Cottler,  &  Goldring,  1989).  Sub-
sequent  follow-up  interviews  were  conducted  in  2000–2002,  2003–2005,  and  in  2009–2010.  The  research  presented  in  this
paper  uses  information  collected  during  all  four  interviews.

Participants  and  design

The  original  sample  of  abused  and  neglected  children  (N  =  908)  was   made  up  of  court-substantiated  cases  of  childhood
physical  and  sexual  abuse  and  neglect  processed  from  1967  to  1971  in  the  county  juvenile  (family)  or  adult  criminal  courts
of  a  Midwestern  metropolitan  area.  Cases  of  abuse  and  neglect  were  restricted  to  children  11  years  of  age  or  less  at  the  time
of  the  incident.  A  control  group  of  children  without  documented  histories  of  child  abuse  or  neglect  (N  =  667)  was   matched
with  the  abuse/neglect  group  on  age,  sex,  race/ethnicity,  and  approximate  family  social  class  during  the  time  that  the  abuse
and  neglect  records  were  processed.

The  control  group  represents  a  critical  component  of  the  study  design.  Children  who  were  under  school  age  at  the  time
of  the  abuse  and/or  neglect  were  matched  with  children  of  the  same  sex,  race,  date  of  birth  (±1  week),  and  hospital  of
birth  through  the  use  of  county  birth  record  information.  For  children  of  school  age,  records  of  more  than  100  elementary
schools  for  the  same  time  period  were  used  to  ﬁnd  matches  with  children  of  the  same  sex,  race,  date  of  birth  (±6  months),
class  in  elementary  school  during  the  years  1967–1971,  and  home  address,  preferably  within  a  ﬁve-block  radius  of  the
abused/neglected  child.  Overall,  matches  were  found  for  74%  of  the  abused  and  neglected  children.  Non-matches  occurred
for  a  number  of  reasons.  For  birth  records,  non-matches  occurred  in  situations  when  the  abused  and  neglected  child  was
born  outside  the  county  or  state  or  when  date  of  birth  information  was  missing.  For  school  records,  non-matches  occurred
because  of  lack  of  adequate  identifying  information  for  the  abused  and  neglected  children  or  because  the  elementary  school
had  closed  and  class  registers  were  not  available.

Of  the  original  sample,  83%  were  located,  and  1,196  (76%)  participated  in  the  1989–1995  interview.  Of  those  participants,
896  completed  the  second  interview  (2000–2002),  808  completed  the  third  interview  (2003–2005),  and  649  completed  the
2009–2010  interviews.  The  composition  of  the  sample  at  the  various  waves  of  interviews  has  remained  about  the  same.
There  were  no  signiﬁcant  differences  in  sex,  race,  age  at  initial  abuse/neglect  petition,  or  proportion  who   experienced  overall
abuse  and/or  neglect  or  any  speciﬁc  type  of  abuse  or  neglect  across  the  four  waves.

Of  the  649  participants  that  completed  the  2009–2010  interviews,  547  had  complete  information  on  the  measures
included  here.  Participants  ranged  in  age  from  38-  to  55-years  old  (M  =  47.10;  SD  =  3.45),  and  42.2%  were  male.  Race/ethnic
composition  was  56.2%  White,  35.3%  African  American,  and  3.4%  Hispanic.  The  overall  abuse  and  neglect  group  represented
53.9%  (n  =  295)  of  the  sample  [physical  abuse  7.7%  (n  =  42),  sexual  abuse  9%  (n  =  49),  and  neglect  43%  (n  =  235)].  These  num-
bers  add  up  to  more  than  295  because  some  participants  had  experienced  more  than  one  type  of  abuse  or  neglect).  Table  1
presents  demographic  characteristics  of  the  sample  and  descriptive  statistics  on  each  of  the  variables.

Procedure

Participants  completed  the  interviews  in  their  homes  or,  if  preferred  by  the  participant,  another  place  appropriate  for
the  interview.  The  interviewers  were  blind  to  the  purpose  of  the  study  and  to  the  inclusion  of  an  abused  and/or  neglected
group.  Participants  were  also  blind  to  the  purpose  of  the  study  and  were  told  that  they  had  been  selected  to  participate  as
part  of  a  large  group  of  individuals  who  grew  up  in  the  late  1960s  and  early  1970s.  Institutional  Review  Board  approval  was
obtained  for  the  procedures  involved  in  this  study,  and  participants  who  participated  gave  written,  informed  consent.  For
individuals  with  limited  reading  ability,  the  consent  form  was   presented  and  explained  verbally.

Measures

Independent  variable.  Childhood  abuse  and  neglect.  Childhood  physical  and  sexual  abuse  and  neglect  were  assessed  through
review  of  ofﬁcial  records  processed  during  the  years  1967–1971.  Physical  abuse  cases  included  injuries  such  as  bruises,
welts,  burns,  abrasions,  lacerations,  wounds,  cuts,  bone  and  skull  fractures,  and  other  evidence  of  physical  injury.  Sexual
abuse  charges  included  felony  sexual  assault,  fondling  or  touching  in  an  obscene  manner,  sodomy,  incest,  and  rape.  Neglect
cases  reﬂected  a  judgment  that  the  parents’  deﬁciencies  in  childcare  were  beyond  those  found  acceptable  by  community
and  professional  standards  at  the  time  and  represented  extreme  failure  to  provide  adequate  food,  clothing,  shelter,  and
medical  attention  to  children.  For  the  current  study,  abuse/neglect  was   coded  (0  =  no  abuse  history,   1  =  history  of  physical,
sexual  abuse,  and/or  neglect).  Any  Physical  abuse  was  coded  (0  =  no  physical  abuse  history,   1  =  history  of  physical  abuse).   Any
Sexual  abuse  was  coded  (0  =  no  sexual  abuse  history,   1  =  history  of  sexual  abuse).  Any  Neglect  was   coded  (0  =  no  neglect  history,

1  =  history  of  neglect).  The  speciﬁc  type  of  abuse  or  neglect  was  coded  as  present,  regardless  of  whether  or  not  the  person
had  experienced  other  types  of  abuse  as  well.  Overall,  10.5%  (n  =  31)  of  the  abuse/neglect  group  experienced  more  than  one
type  of  maltreatment.

Outcome  variable.  International  Affective  Picture  System.  (IAPS,  Lang,  Bradley,  &  Cuthbert,  2005).  The  IAPS,  a  set  of  photos
depicting  positive,  negative,  or  neutral  content,  has  been  used  as  a  paradigm  for  studying  the  processing  of  emotional  stimuli
(Bradley,  Greenwald,  Petry,  &  Lang,  1992).  The  IAPS  has  previously  been  used  as  a  recall/recognition  task  to  measure  memory
of  affective  information  (Blake,  Varnhagen,  &  Parent,  2001;  Bradley  et  al.,  1992;  Talmi,  Schimmack,  Paterson,  &  Moscovitch,
2007).  Research  suggests  that  attention  is  more  likely  to  be  directed  to  a  stimulus  with  a  motivational  signiﬁcance  to  an
individual  (e.g.,  an  emotional  stimulus)  than  a  neutral,  non-relevant  stimulus  (Sanchez-Navarro,  Martinez-Selva,  &  Roman,
2006).  In  addition,  several  researchers  have  found  that  emotion  has  an  enhancing  effect  on  memory  (e.g.  Bradley  et  al.,
1992).  Therefore,  in  the  IAPS  recognition  task,  participants  should  be  more  accurate  in  recognizing  positively  and  negatively
valenced  pictures  compared  to  neutral  pictures  and  deﬁcits  in  recognizing  emotionally  valenced  pictures  may   suggest  that
the  participant  failed  to  attend  to  the  emotional  cues  in  the  picture.  In  this  conceptualization,  recognition  is  a  marker  of
vigilance  for  emotional  stimuli.

The  latest  version  of  the  IAPS  (Lang  et  al.,  2005)  was   used  during  the  2009–2010  in-person  interview.  The  developers  of
the  IAPS  provide  normative  ratings  on  the  valence  (positive,  negative,  neutral)  and  dimensions  of  valence,  ranging  from  1
(the  most  negative)  to  9  (the  most  positive)  on  a  Likert-type  rating  scale.  Out  of  the  total  942  digital  still  photos  that  comprise
the  IAPS  library,  a  total  of  24  images,  8  neutral  and  16  emotional  (8  positive,  8  negative)  were  chosen  using  valence  ratings
obtained  from  prior  validation  studies  (see  Appendix  A  for  the  IAPS  numbers,  a  brief  title  for  the  image,  and  image  valences
for  all  images  used  in  this  study).  The  pictures  selected  varied  widely  in  content  (including  the  neutral  and  mundane)  and
affective  tone,  from  calm  to  arousing  and  pleasant  to  unpleasant.  Each  of  these  24  images  had  a  novel  partner  image  similar
in  content  and,  when  possible,  matched  on  emotional  valence  that  was  used  in  the  recognition  task.  Like  the  original  images,
the  24  matching,  novel  images  were  selected  from  the  IAPS.  The  IAPS  emotion  valence  scores  for  each  group  (negative,
positive,  and  neutral)  differed  signiﬁcantly  from  each  other,  F(2,  47)  =  334.32,  p  <  .01,  with  the  valence  of  positive  images
averaging  7.48,  neutral  images  5.17,  and  negative  images  2.92.

Before  the  IAPS  was  administered,  participants  were  told  that  they  would  be  viewing  a  series  of  images  on  the  computer
screen  and  to  watch  the  images  as  they  would  a  television.  Administration  consisted  of  two   parts:  (a)  an  initial  presentation
phase  in  which  the  participant  watched  a  series  of  24  target  images  (positive,  neutral,  and  negative)  presented  in  random
order  for  2  s  each  (with  no  pause  between  images),  and  (b)  a  recognition  phase  approximately  15  min   later  in  which  the
participant  watched  a  second  series  of  48  images  (24  of  which  were  the  original  target  images  from  the  presentation  phase
and  24  “novel  partner”  images)  presented  in  random  order.  During  the  recognition  phase,  the  participant  was  instructed  to
indicate  whether  or  not  he/she  saw  each  image  earlier.  Each  image  appeared  on  the  screen  until  the  participant  pressed  a  key
to  indicate  whether  he/she  had  seen  the  image  before.  Pictures  were  presented  on  a  standard  sized  laptop  PC.  Recognition
accuracy  was  calculated  as  the  number  of  times  the  participant  correctly  indicated  whether  or  not  he/she  had  seen  each  of
the  positive,  negative,  and  neutral  pictures  previously  during  the  presentation  phase.

Potential  mediators.   Psychopathology  The  Diagnostic  Interview  Schedule  –  Revised  (DIS-III-R),  a  standardized  psychiatric
assessment  that  yields  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders  (DSM-III-R)  diagnoses  (Robins  et  al.,  1989)  was
administered  during  the  1989–1995  in-person  interviews  to  assess  for  Generalized  Anxiety  Disorder  (GAD),  Posttraumatic
Stress  Disorder  (PTSD),  Major  Depressive  Disorder  (MDD),  and  Dysthymia.  Continuous  variables  reﬂecting  the  number  of
lifetime  symptoms  reported  for  each  of  these  disorders  are  used  in  analyses.  The  DIS-III-R  demonstrates  adequate  reliability
(Robins,  Helzer,  Croughan,  &  Ratcliff,  1981).  Table  1  presents  the  means  and  standard  deviations  for  the  number  of  lifetime
symptoms  for  each  of  these  disorders  for  these  participants  at  approximate  age  29.

Psychopathy.  The  Psychopathy  Checklist-  Revised  (PCL-R;  Hare,  1991,  2003),  the  revised  20-item  version,  was  used  to
determine  psychopathy  scores  for  the  participants.  Psychopathy  ratings  were  based  on  information  obtained  from  both
ofﬁcial  records  and  the  1989–1995  interviews  (see  Weiler  &  Widom,  1996  for  details).  Following  Hare  (1991),  items  were
scored  as  follows:  0  =  the  person  does  not  meet  the  criteria  for  the  item,  1  =  the  person  meets  the  criteria  to  a  certain  extent,   and
2  =  the  person  clearly  meets  the  criteria  for  the  item.  Because  of  the  large  number  of  participants  and  the  massive  amount  of
information,  computer-generated  PCL-R  scores  based  on  ratings  from  trained  raters  were  calculated  for  each  subject  using
SPSSX.  A  computerized  scoring  algorithm  was  developed  after  careful  review  and  study  of  the  criteria  described  in  the  PCL-R
manual,  discussion  of  the  criteria  and  information  available  from  our  interview  and  ﬁles  with  PCL-R  trainers.  Using  data
from  participants  without  excessive  missing  data,  reliability  analysis  of  the  PCL-R  in  SPSS  indicated  that  Cronbach’s  alpha
was  .80.  In  this  sample,  PCL-R  scores  ranged  from  0  to  30  (M  =  7.65;  SD  =  6.48)  with  6.4%  scoring  above  20,  the  top  third  of
the  distribution  of  scores  (see  Table  1).

IQ.   The  Quick  Test  (QT;  Ammons  &  Ammons,  1962),  a  vocabulary  test  of  intelligence  that  provides  an  index  of  overall
cognitive  functioning,  was  measured  during  the  ﬁrst  interview  that  occurred  during  1989–1995.  The  QT  has  been  demon-
strated  to  be  a  useful,  reliable  estimate  of  intellectual  functioning  (Ammons  &  Ammons,  1962).  Total  scores  were  based  on
a  raw  count  of  items  correct  that  were  then  recoded  into  scores  ranging  from  0  to  160  to  be  consistent  with  typical  IQ  test
scoring  with  higher  scores  indicating  higher  intellectual  functioning  (see  Table  1).  The  validity  of  the  QT  has  been  established
through  comparisons  with  other  measures  of  IQ  such  as  the  Wechsler  Adult  Intelligence  Scale,  particularly  with  WAIS  Verbal
IQ  (Abidin  &  Byrne,  1967;  Davis  &  Dizzonne,  1970).

Demographic  information.  Control  variables  included  sex  (male  =  0,  female  =  1),  race  (White,  non-Hispanic  =  1,  others  =  2),
age,  and  socio-economic  status  (see  Table  1).  Age  was  a  continuous  variable  representing  the  participant’s  age  during
the  2009–2010  interviews.  Occupational  Code  from  the  Hollingshead  Four  Factor  Index  of  Socioeconomic  Status  (SES)
(Hollingshead,  1975)  was  used,  with  nine  categories  ranging  from  menial  service  workers  to  higher  executives.

Analyses

Prior  to  analysis,  all  variables  in  the  study  were  assessed  for  univariate  normality  and  multicollinearity.  To  assess  uni-
variate  normality,  skewness  and  kurtosis  values  were  assessed  using  the  guidelines  for  larger  sample  sizes  (DeCarlo,  1997;
Tabachnick  &  Fidell,  2013).  No  variables  in  this  study  were  determined  to  be  skewed  or  kurtotic.  Multicollinearity  was
assessed  using  the  Variance  Inﬂation  Factor  (VIF)  criteria  (Tabachnick  &  Fidell,  2013)  and  no  variables  were  determined  to
be  multicollinear.  (Correlation  coefﬁcients  for  all  variables  and  measures  are  presented  in  Table  2.)

Ordinary  Least  Squares  (OLS)  regressions  were  conducted  to  determine  whether  child  abuse  and  neglect  predicted  poten-
tial  mediators  (psychopathology  and  IQ)  and  recognition  accuracy.  Regressions  are  reported  using  standardized  coefﬁcients

(ˇ)  and  all  analyses  controlled  for  age,  sex,  race,  and  SES.  Separate  regressions  were  performed  to  examine  positive,  negative,
and  neutral  recognition  accuracy.

Mplus  Version  6.0  was  used  to  conduct  Structural  Equation  Modeling  (SEM)  to  examine  the  role  of  potential  mediators
of  the  relationship  between  childhood  abuse  and  neglect  and  picture  recognition  accuracy.  All  analyses  controlled  for  age,
sex,  race,  and  SES,  and  matched  controls  were  used  as  the  comparison  group  in  all  analyses.  For  structural  models,  multiple
indices  of  overall  model  ﬁt  (chi-square  statistic  [!2],  comparative  ﬁt  index  [CFI],  Tucker–Lewis  index  [TLI],  root-mean-square
error  of  approximation  [RMSEA],  and  standardized  root  mean  square  residual  [SRMR])  were  evaluated.  A  low  chi-square
and  non-signiﬁcance  (p  <  .05)  are  desirable,  and  a  chi-square  to  degrees  of  freedom  (df)  ratio  of  less  than  5  is  considered
adequate  (Bollen,  1989).  A  comparative  ﬁt  index  (CFI)  and  Tucker–Lewis  index  (TLI)  of  .90  or  higher  indicate  good  ﬁt.  Root-
mean-square  error  of  approximation  (RMSEA)  of  less  than  .05  is  considered  a  close  ﬁt,  and  a  standardized  root  mean  square
residual  (SRMR)  of  less  than  .08  is  generally  considered  a  good  ﬁt  (Hu  &  Bentler,  1999).  Current  recommendations  support
consideration  of  both  the  chi-square  test  and  other  indices  of  model  ﬁt  (Barrett,  2007).

Strength  of  mediational  relationships  was  evaluated  with  tests  of  indirect  effects  (MacKinnon,  Lockwood,  Hoffman,
West,  &  Sheets,  2002)  and  bias-corrected  bootstrapped  conﬁdence  intervals  (MacKinnon,  Lockwood,  &  Williams,  2004).  Full
information  maximum  likelihood  estimation  was  used  to  handle  missing  data  on  the  SES  variable.  This  method  uses  all
data  available  for  each  case  and  thus  avoids  biases  and  loss  of  power  associated  with  traditional  approaches  to  missing  data
(Allison,  2003;  Schlomer,  Bauman,  &  Card,  2010).

Results

Child  abuse  and  neglect  and  recognition  accuracy

Table  3  presents  ﬁndings  regarding  accuracy  in  emotion  recognition  by  group  (abuse/neglect  vs.  control)  and  type  of
maltreatment  (any  physical  abuse,  any  sexual  abuse,  and  any  neglect  vs.  control).  As  hypothesized,  childhood  abuse  and
neglect  signiﬁcantly  predicted  overall  recognition  accuracy  (ˇ  = −0.11,  p  <  .01)  and  this  model  explained  5%  of  the  variance
(R2 =  .05,  p  <  .01)  indicating  that  individuals  with  a  history  of  childhood  abuse/neglect  were  less  accurate  in  recognizing

pictures  than  those  without  a  history  of  childhood  abuse/neglect.  Neglect  also  signiﬁcantly  predicted  overall  recognition
accuracy  (ˇ  = −0.10,  p  <  .05)  explaining  5%  of  the  variance  (R2 =  .05,  p  <  .05),  but  physical  and  sexual  abuse  did  not.  However,  it
should  be  noted  physical  and  sexual  abuse  showed  a  similar  non-signiﬁcant  trend.  The  effect  size  and  the  mean  recognition
accuracy  scores  for  physical  and  sexual  abuse  groups  were  similar  to  those  for  the  neglect  group,  suggesting  that  the  lack  of
signiﬁcant  ﬁndings  for  overall  picture  recognition  accuracy  for  the  physical  and  sexual  abuse  groups  may   have  been  due  to
the  small  sample  size  of  these  two  groups.

Picture  valence  and  recognition  accuracy

Negative,  neutral,  and  positive  picture  recognition  accuracy  scores  were  also  compared  for  group  (abuse/neglect  vs.
control)  and  type  of  maltreatment  (see  Table  3).  Abuse/neglect  overall  (ˇ  = −0.13,  p  <  .01)  and  neglect  (ˇ  = −0.13,  p  <  .01)
each  signiﬁcantly  predicted  positive  picture  recognition  accuracy,  indicating  less  accuracy  among  these  individuals  in  rec-
ognizing  positive  pictures,  compared  to  controls.  In  addition,  abuse/neglect  overall  (ˇ  = −0.10,  p  <  .05)  and  physical  abuse
(ˇ  = −0.12,  p  <  .05)  each  signiﬁcantly  predicted  less  accuracy  in  neutral  picture  recognition.  Neither  abuse/neglect  in  general
or  speciﬁc  types  of  maltreatment  predicted  negative  picture  recognition  accuracy.  Interestingly,  although  not  hypothesized,
childhood  sexual  abuse  predicted  poorer  performance  on  positive  picture  recognition,  compared  to  controls  (ˇ  = −0.13,
p  <  .05).

Child  abuse  and  neglect  and  potential  mediators:  psychopathology,  psychopathy,  and  IQ

The  next  set  of  results  examined  the  extent  to  which  the  independent  variables  (overall  abuse/neglect  and  type  of  mal-
treatment)  predicted  the  hypothesized  mediators  (psychopathology,  psychopathy,  and  IQ).  The  results  in  Table  4  indicate  that
a  history  of  child  abuse  and  neglect  signiﬁcantly  predicted  increased  symptoms  of  MDD   (ˇ  =  0.11,  p  <  .01),  Dysthymia  (ˇ  =  0.14,
p  <  .01),  PTSD  (ˇ  =  0.16,  p  <  .001),  and  Psychopathy  (ˇ  =  0.21,  p  <  .001),  and  lower  IQ  (ˇ  = −0.21,  p  <  .001)  compared  to  controls.
This  pattern  of  results  was  the  same  for  the  neglect  group  (see  Table  4).  A  history  of  physical  abuse  predicted  increased

or  GAD  (ˇ  =  0.09,  p  =  0.14),  MDD   (ˇ  =  0.10,  p  =  0.10),  or  Dysthymia  symptoms  (ˇ  =  0.11,  p  =  0.07).  The  pattern  of  results  for  the
sexual  abuse  group  was  the  same  as  for  the  physical  abuse  group  (see  Table  4).

Structural  equation  models

Overall  picture  recognition  accuracy.  Separate  models  were  tested  for  each  potential  mediator,  with  controls  for  age,  race,
sex,  and  SES  (see  Table  5)  for  abuse/neglect  overall  and  for  neglect  speciﬁcally.  We   did  not  test  these  mediation  models  for
physical  and  sexual  abuse  because  the  results  of  the  earlier  analyses  indicated  that  they  were  not  signiﬁcant  predictors  of
picture  recognition  accuracy.

For  child  abuse  and  neglect  overall,  the  ﬁrst  column  of  Table  5  shows  that  the  effect  of  child  abuse/neglect  on  psychopathol-
ogy  and  IQ  was  consistent  with  bivariate  relationships  described.  Column  2  shows  that  MDD,  GAD,  and  IQ  predicted  overall
emotion  processing,  whereas  the  other  variables  did  not.  Looking  at  columns  3  and  4,  it  can  be  seen  that  the  introduction  of
IQ  had  a  signiﬁcant  mediation  effect  and  reduced  the  effect  of  child  maltreatment  on  overall  accuracy  in  emotion  processing
to  non-signiﬁcance,  suggesting  that  child  abuse  and  neglect  inﬂuences  picture  recognition  accuracy  through  its  effects  on
IQ.  Goodness  of  ﬁt  indices  for  the  model  including  child  abuse  and  neglect  overall  and  IQ  as  a  mediator  were  !2(4)  =  8.40,
p  =  .08,  CFI  =  0.96,  TLI  =  0.90,  RMSEA  =  .05,  SRMR  =  0.02.  This  model  explained  10%  of  the  variance  in  recognition  accuracy
and  the  indirect  effect  was  signiﬁcant  (ˇ  = −0.07,  p  <  .001).  In  contrast,  the  models  that  included  other  potential  mediators
(MDD,  Dysthymia,  PTSD,  GAD,  and  Psychopathy)  did  not  yield  ﬁt  indices  in  the  acceptable  range,  and  therefore,  paths  are
not  interpretable.

For  the  neglect  group  speciﬁcally,  the  ﬁrst  column  again  shows  that  the  effect  of  neglect  on  psychopathology  and  IQ  was
consistent  with  bivariate  relationships  described  earlier.  However,  Column  2  shows  that  only  GAD  and  IQ  predicted  emotion
processing  accuracy,  whereas  the  other  potential  mediators  did  not.  Again,  the  introduction  of  IQ  produced  a  signiﬁcant
mediation  effect  and  reduced  the  effect  of  child  maltreatment  on  emotion  processing  to  non-signiﬁcance,  suggesting  that
child  abuse  and  neglect  inﬂuences  picture  recognition  accuracy  through  its  effects  on  IQ.  Goodness  of  ﬁt  indices  for  the
model  including  only  IQ  were  !2(4)  =  9.65,  p  <  .05,  CFI  =  0.96,  TLI  =  0.90,  RMSEA  =  .05,  SRMR  =  0.03.  This  model  explained  15%
of  the  variance  in  recognition  accuracy  and  the  indirect  effect  was  signiﬁcant  (ˇ  = −0.08,  p  <  .001).  In  contrast,  the  models
including  each  of  the  other  potential  mediators  (MDD,  Dysthymia,  PTSD,  GAD,  and  Psychopathy)  did  not  yield  ﬁt  indices  in
the  acceptable  range  and,  therefore,  the  paths  were  not  interpretable.

Discussion

This  is  the  ﬁrst  prospective  study  of  emotion  processing  accuracy  in  individuals  with  documented  cases  of  childhood
abuse  and  neglect  who  were  followed  up  and  assessed  in  middle  adulthood.  As  hypothesized,  these  ﬁndings  showed
that  individuals  with  a  history  of  childhood  abuse  and/or  neglect  were  less  accurate  in  processing  affective  pictures  than
those  without  such  a  history.  In  addition,  these  results  showed  that  childhood  histories  of  abuse/neglect  in  general  and

neglect  and  sexual  abuse  in  particular  predicted  deﬁcits  in  positive,  but  not  negative,  picture  recognition.  These  results  were
unexpected,  but  it  is  possible  that  these  previously  abused  and  neglected  individuals  have  developed  negative  worldviews
that  might  have  prevented  them  from  recognizing  positive  emotions.  It  is  also  possible  that  they  have  received  and  per-
ceived  less  positive  emotions  during  their  lives,  making  it  more  difﬁcult  in  adulthood  to  recognize  and  distinguish  positive
emotions.

In  contrast  to  our  hypotheses,  the  processing  of  negatively  valenced  pictures  did  not  differ  between  maltreated  and
control  groups  and  speciﬁcally  for  individuals  with  histories  of  physical  abuse  and  neglect.  It  is  possible  that  the  task
assessed  here  was  substantially  different  than  past  studies  of  facial  emotion  perception.  Facial  emotion  perception  depends
on  facial  expressions  for  emotion-related  cues,  whereas  cues  in  the  affective  pictures  presented  here  include  those  from
facial  expression,  body  posture,  and  contextual  factors.  Therefore,  deﬁcits  may   be  more  difﬁcult  to  detect  because  more
emotion-related  cues  are  available.  It  is  also  possible  that  these  extra  cues  enabled  these  individuals  to  compensate  for
deﬁcits.

We  had  speciﬁcally  hypothesized  that  physically  abused  children  would  have  problems  with  negative  emotion  pictures,
but  the  results  did  not  support  this  hypothesis.  On  ﬁrst  glance,  one  might  attribute  this  result  to  the  smaller  sample  size  for
the  physically  abused  group  and  interpret  the  lack  of  deﬁcits  in  negative  emotion  processing  as  a  power  problem.  However,
inspection  of  the  small  effect  size  suggests  that  low  power  was   not  the  case,  and  the  signiﬁcant  ﬁnding  that  adults  with  a
history  of  childhood  physical  abuse  were  less  accurate  in  processing  neutral  affective  pictures.  Another  possibility  is  that
individuals  with  histories  of  physical  abuse  might  have  been  more  likely  to  identify  neutral  stimuli  as  negative,  based
on  a  negative  attribution  bias  (Dodge,  Pettit,  Bates,  &  Valente,  1995).  This  possibility  is  intriguing,  but  unfortunately,  the
current  paradigm  does  not  permit  an  examination  of  the  type  of  errors  made.  Participants  were  only  asked  to  indicate
whether  they  had  seen  the  picture  previously  or  not.  They  were  not  asked  to  judge  the  positivity  or  negativity  of  the
pictures  as  has  been  done  in  facial  emotion  recognition  paradigms.  Future  research  will  need  to  examine  these  issues  more
carefully.

Although  it  was  hypothesized  that  the  emotion  processing  deﬁcits  in  previously  abused  and  neglected  children  might
be  the  result  of  psychopathology  (Generalized  Anxiety  Disorder,  PTSD,  Dysthymia,  and  Major  Depressive  Disorder)  or  psy-
chopathy,  we  found  that  lifetime  symptoms  of  MDD   and  GAD  assessed  at  age  29  predicted  overall  emotion  recognition
accuracy  at  mean  age  47.  Interestingly,  these  new  ﬁndings  are  consistent  with  the  previous  research  on  psychopathology
and  emotion  perception  in  clinical  samples.  However,  these  two   forms  of  psychopathology  (MDD  and  GAD)  did  not  account
for  the  relationship  between  child  abuse/neglect  and  picture  recognition  accuracy.  These  new  ﬁndings  are  similar  to  the
earlier  work  of  Masten  et  al.  (2008)  with  children  that  suggested  that  maltreatment  is  uniquely  related  to  emotion  processing
deﬁcits  regardless  of  PTSD  symptomatology.

It  was  also  expected  that  psychopathy  would  predict  deﬁcits  in  emotion  perception,  although  we   did  not  ﬁnd  this  to  be
the  case.  It  may   be  that  characteristics  of  much  of  the  prior  literature  [a  focus  on  incarcerated  or  forensic  samples  (Blair  et  al.,
2004;  Deeley  et  al.,  2006;  Iria  &  Barbosa,  2009;  Pham  &  Philippot,  2010)]  may   in  part  explain  the  differences  in  ﬁndings.
For  example,  one  might  wonder  whether  there  is  something  about  psychopaths  who   get  caught  and  are  incarcerated  that
inﬂuences  the  emotion  perception  ﬁndings.

These  results  indicated  that  only  IQ  played  a  signiﬁcant  role  as  a  mediator  between  child  maltreatment  and  emotion
processing  accuracy  in  adulthood.  These  new  ﬁndings  suggest  that  emotion  processing  studies  need  to  control  for  partici-
pants’  IQ  because  it  is  clear  from  these  results  that  IQ  had  a  substantial  impact  on  recognition  accuracy.  It  is  also  possible
that  the  task  here  may   have  demanded  more  cognitive  skills  than  other  types  of  emotion  processing  tasks  and,  therefore,
maltreated  individuals  with  lower  IQs  might  have  been  particularly  disadvantaged.

Although  these  ﬁndings  provide  important  information  about  the  effects  of  child  abuse  and  neglect  on  emotion  processing,
some  limitations  should  be  noted.  First,  the  ﬁndings  are  based  on  cases  of  childhood  abuse  and  neglect  drawn  from  ofﬁ-
cial  court  records  and  most  likely  represent  the  most  extreme  cases  processed  in  the  system.  Second,  cases  that  came  to
the  attention  of  the  courts  are  skewed  toward  the  lower  end  of  the  socio-economic  spectrum  and,  therefore,  these  results
cannot  be  generalized  to  abused  and  neglected  children  who   grew  up  in  middle-  or  upper-class  homes.  Third,  the  data
were  from  cases  of  abuse  and  neglect  that  occurred  in  the  late  1960s  and  early  1970s  in  the  Midwest  part  of  the  United
States.  Research  should  attempt  to  replicate  these  ﬁndings  in  samples  from  other  time  periods  and  geographic  regions.
However,  these  cases  of  child  abuse  and  neglect  are  from  the  late  1960s  and  early  1970s  are  comparable  in  demographic
characteristics  to  the  kinds  of  cases  being  processed  by  child  protection  services  across  the  country.  Fourth,  a  ﬁnal  lim-
itation  suggested  by  one  anonymous  reviewer  is  that  IQ  may   not  be  stable  over  time  (see  Salthouse,  2001).  Therefore,
although  the  temporal  relationship  in  the  present  study  is  appropriate  to  examine  the  mediating  role  of  intelligence,  it  is
possible  that  IQ  assessed  in  childhood  or  adolescence  may   have  shown  a  different  relationship  to  emotion  picture  accu-
racy  than  IQ  assessed  in  young  adulthood.  Unfortunately,  we   are  not  able  to  explore  these  possibilities  with  our  existing
data.

Despite  these  limitations,  the  present  study  builds  on  previous  research  on  emotion  processing  and  childhood  mal-
treatment  in  several  ways.  First,  by  studying  affective  picture  recognition  rather  than  emotion  perception  ability,  this
study  examines  another  aspect  of  emotion  processing  that  involves  more  basic  attentional  processes  to  emotionally
salient  environmental  cues.  This  aspect  of  emotion  processing  has  broader  implications  for  daily  emotional  functioning
in  that  it  suggests  deﬁcits  in  attending  to  various  emotional  cues  in  the  environment  rather  than  just  faces  in  par-
ticular.  Second,  by  studying  an  adult  sample,  this  study  showed  that  effects  of  childhood  abuse/neglect  on  emotion

processing  extend  until  middle  adulthood,  although  it  would  be  worthwhile  to  have  multiple  assessments  over  time
to  rule  out  competing  explanations  for  improvement  (or  lack  thereof)  in  emotion  processing  skills.  Third,  this  study
examined  effects  of  different  types  of  maltreatment  on  emotion  processing  and  found  victims  of  childhood  neglect  and
sexual  abuse  had  difﬁculty  processing  positive  pictures.  Fourth,  the  current  study  suggests  that  psychopathology  and
psychopathy  do  not  signiﬁcantly  mediate  the  relationship  between  childhood  maltreatment  and  emotion  processing,
although  it  was   clear  that  certain  forms  of  psychopathology  did  have  an  impact  on  emotion  processing  accuracy.  Lastly,
this  study  adds  to  the  existing  literature  by  suggesting  that  intelligence  may   mediate  the  relationship  between  child-
hood  maltreatment  and  emotion  processing.  Therefore,  research  and  interventions  that  target  emotional  processing
deﬁcits  in  victims  of  childhood  maltreatment  must  consider  and  take  into  account  the  possible  presence  of  intellectual
deﬁcits.
