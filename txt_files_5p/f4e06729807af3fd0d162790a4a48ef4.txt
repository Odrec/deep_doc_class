Argument Reconstruction

Previous Session/Homework

Î¦ Argument Reconstruction

An argument reconstruction consists of

1 a corresponding argument scheme Î¦0, Î¦1, ..., Î¦n âˆ´ Î¨ with

a formalization (translation scheme) that assigns sentence
letters to simple natural language sentence

2 an assessment of the validity of Î¦0, Î¦1, ..., Î¦n âˆ´ Î¨

To show that an argument is valid, we have to prove that the
inference conditional Î¦0 âˆ§ Î¦1 âˆ§ ... âˆ§ Î¦n â†’ Î¨ is true under every
interpretation.

Argument Reconstruction
in Lpred

Previous Session/Homework

Î¦ Argument Reconstruction

validity is a semantic notion, we want to prove that
Î¦0 âˆ§ Î¦1 âˆ§ ... âˆ§ Î¦n â†’ Î¨ is tautologous
but our semantic proof procedures in Lpred are lacking:
we only learned how to deal with single nite interpretations,
semantic trees cannot deal with the identity symbol and are
inecient for large formulas
so we prove Î¦0, Î¦1, ..., Î¦n (cid:96) Î¨ syntactically and can infer
from GLCQ's soundness that Î¦0, Î¦1, ..., Î¦n |= Î¨ also holds

Argument Reconstruction
Using Soundness and Completeness

Previous Session/Homework

Î¦ Argument Reconstruction

A calculus C is sound i
you can only derive formulas that also follow semantically.

GLCQ is sound, so its rules are truth-preserving. A syntactic proof
guarantees that the corresponding inference is also semantically
correct.

A calculus C is complete i
you can derive all formulas that follow semantically.

GLCQ is complete, so for every semantic proof there is a syntactic
one in GLCQ.

Reconstructing Invalid Arguments

Previous Session/Homework

Î¦ Argument Reconstruction

Sometimes arguments are invalid.

In Lpred , we cannot prove that an argument is invalid:

semantic trees: if not all branches are closed, wrong instantial
names may have been chosen

syntactic proofs: if we cannot prove the argument, we may
not have been able to think of the correct proof

In this case you have to show that there is a counter-model, an
interpretation such that the premises are true and the conclusion
false.

Counter-Models

Previous Session/Homework

Î¦ Argument Reconstruction

In this case you have to show that there is a counter-model, an
interpretation such that the premises are true and the conclusion
false.

A nite Lpred interpretation of a set of Lpred sentences
{Î¦0 . . . Î¦n} consists of

1 a universe: a nite non-empty set of objects

2 an assignment of one object of the universe to each name

3 an assignment of a set of tuples over objects of the

universe to each predicate

4 an assignment of truth values to each sentence letter

Exercise

Previous Session/Homework

Î¦ Argument Reconstruction

The conlusion of argument A does not follow from anything.
Argument A being valid is necessary and sucient for its
conclusion to follow from its premises. All sound things are valid.
Therefore, argument A is sound.

F : ... follows from ...

S: ... is sound
V : ... is valid
a: argument A

c: conclusion of argument A
p: premises of argument A

Reconstructing Arguments

Previous Session/Homework

Î¦ Argument Reconstruction

Assessing validity can be done in three ways:

1 provide a syntactic derivation (valid)

2 provide a semantic tree in which all branches are closed

(valid)

3 provide a counter-model (invalid)

Yo, if ther's a hustler, it's gettin' crazy up in a hood. Gangsters or
guys in trouble be hustlin' for real. And although Carlos is rappin'
or at least a gangster: Noone that ain't in trouble's rappin'. To me
it's crystal clear that Carlos is da hustler and it be getting crazy up
in da hood.

C : It is getting crazy in the hood.

H: ... is hustling

G : ... is a gangster
T : ... is in trouble
