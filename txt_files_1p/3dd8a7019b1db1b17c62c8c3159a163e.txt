QUESTIONS: JONATHAN CULLER, “WHAT IS THEORY?” (CONTD.)

• “Power, for Foucault, is not something someone 
wields but ‘power/ knowledge’” (8). Explain the 
juxtaposition of terms “power/knowledge.”

• What is genealogical critique?
• What does Derrida mean by the logic of 

supplementarity? How does he read it from 
Rousseau’s Confessions? What implications 
does it have for our understanding of the 
relationship between reality and appearance 
or an original and its copy?

• What conclusions does Culler draw regarding 

the nature of theory?
