The seven most common forms of business organizations are:

the sole proprietorship; 

the general partnership; 

the limited partnership; 

the business trust with transferable shares;  

the business corporation;  

the limited liability company; and  

the limited liability partnership. 

Each of these forms of business organizations differs from the others in terms of 
(a) governing law, (b) the formalities of organization, (c) control and management of the 
business, (d) personal liability of the owners, (e) continuity of legal existence and 
(f) transferability of interests in the business.  Each has distinctive tax advantages and 
disadvantages. 
 

The distinguishing characteristics of each form of business organization under 

Massachusetts law are discussed in Sections II-VIII below.  The principal tax consequences of 
each form of business organization are discussed in summary fashion in Section IX.
