Probability Distributions 
 

We defined probability as: 
(probability that the random variable X takes the Value xi)  
 

•

A Discrete Probability Distribution:  

Rehearsal 

𝑝(𝑋 = 𝑥𝑖) 

A distribution is discrete if the random variable X is discrete, such that 
the range of X is finite or countably infinite. 

 

e.g. Poisson distribution, Bernoulli distribution, binomial distribution, 
geometric distribution, negative binomial distribution 

 

•

A Continuous Probability Distribution :  

A distribution of a random variable X is called continuous if the range of 
X is uncountably infinite. 

 

e.g. normal, uniform, chi-squared, and others.
