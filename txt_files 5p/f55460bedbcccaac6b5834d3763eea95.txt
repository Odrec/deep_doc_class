List of current heads of state and government
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

This is a list of current heads of state and government, showing heads of state and heads of government where different,
mainly in parliamentary systems. Often a leader is both in presidential systems. Some states have semi-presidential systems,
where the head of government role (i.e. executive branch) is fulfilled by both the listed head of government and head of
state.

The list includes the names of recently elected or appointed heads who will take office on an appointed date.

In this state, the president is both head of state and government; the office of prime minister may exist in these states, but it does
not direct executive power—neither does the Argentine Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers, the Afghan Chief Executive Officer,
nor the State Counsellor of Myanmar, either.
The President of France and the French Co-Prince of Andorra are positions held by the same person.
Legally, Elizabeth is separately and equally monarch of 16 sovereign states, including the United Kingdom, known collectively as
the Commonwealth realms. In each of these states, with the exception of the UK—where she permanently resides—she is duly
represented at the national level by a governor-general.
The three-member Bosnian presidency is head of state collectively.
Temer assumed the Brazilian presidency during the course of the suspension of Rousseff on 12 May.
The Governor-General of New Zealand and the Governor-General of Niue are positions held by the same person.
The term Supreme Leader is used as a description, for the sake of brevity, rather than being an official title of a single office. The
actual offices held by Kim are: Chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea; First Chairman of the National Defence Commission;
Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army.
The President (otherwise known as Chairman) of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly accepts the credentials of
foreign ambassadors, signs treaties, receives visiting heads of state, and represents North Korea on all state visits—ceremonial
functions normally performed by Heads of State in other states. The president has held these duties since 1998, when the
constitution was revised.
Since 2012, the Sammarinese Grand and General Council has held more parliamentary seats belonging to the former partner's
political party (Christian Democratic Party) than those for the latter's party (Popular Alliance)—thus, it can be argued and inferred
that the former exercises wider legislative capabilities between the partnership and from the diarchy through the coalition
government and legislative body itself, and hence San Marino.
The seven-member Swiss Federal Council is head of state and government collectively. Within this executive council, the
president serves solely in a primus inter pares capacity for one year.
In theory, Erdoğan is barred from wielding political power and as the Turkish head of state is, in strict accordance with the
constitution of 1982 (which as of 2016 remains unamended since a 2010 referendum), legislatively bound to act in a ceremonial
capacity. In spite of this, he has continued to maintain his cultivated strongman persona, and is widely perceived by both the
Turkish public and media in general as, in practice, the sole paramount leader of Turkey—notwithstanding his resignation as
prime minister and (unprecedentedly with his direct 2014 election, held two weeks earlier, as the first consented via universal
suffrage) then immediate elevation to the Turkish presidency. Moreover, due to the non-conforming and seemingly
unconstitutional nature of these circumstances, pertaining explanations have usually referred to his sustained partisan leverage
exerted vis-à-vis his personally loyal Justice and Development Party (AKP), the ruling majority political party he founded and
then formally led in 2001–14, as the extended root of his political capital.
