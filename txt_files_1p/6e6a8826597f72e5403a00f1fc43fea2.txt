Introduction: Diverse combinations of built environment (BE) features for physical activity (PA)
are understudied. This study explored whether patterns of GIS-derived BE features explained
objective and self-reported PA, sedentary behavior, and BMI.
Methods: Neighborhood Quality of Life Study participants (N¬º2,199, aged 20‚Äì65 years, 48.2%
female, 26% ethnic minority) were sampled in 2001‚Äì2005 from Seattle / King County WA and
Baltimore MD / Washington DC regions. Their addresses were geocoded to compute net residential
density, land use mix, retail Ô¨Çoor area ratio, intersection density, public transit, and public park and
private recreation facility densities using a 1-km network buffer. Latent proÔ¨Åle analyses (LPAs) were
estimated from these variables. Multilevel regression models compared proÔ¨Åles on accelerometer-
measured moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) and self-reported PA, adjusting for covariates and
clustering. Analyses were conducted in 2013‚Äì2014.

Results: Seattle region LPAs yielded four proÔ¨Åles, including low walkability/transit/recreation
(L-L-L); mean walkability/transit/recreation (M-M-M); moderately high walkability/transit/
recreation (MH-MH-MH); and high walkability/transit/recreation (H-HH). All measures were
higher in the HHH than the LLL proÔ¨Åle (difference of 17.1 minutes/day for MVPA, 146.5
minutes/week for walking for transportation, 58.2 minutes/week for leisure-time PA, and 2.2
BMI points; all po0.05). Baltimore region LPAs yielded four proÔ¨Åles, including L-L-L; M-M-M;
high land use mix, transit, and recreation (HLU-HT-HRA); and high intersection density, high
retail Ô¨Çoor area ratio (HID-HRFAR). HLU-HT-HRA and L-L-L differed by 12.3 MVPA
minutes/day; HID-HRFAR and L-L-L differed by 157.4 minutes/week for walking for trans-
portation (all po0.05).
Conclusions: Patterns of environmental features explain greater differences in adults‚Äô PA than the
four-component walkability index.

Introduction

M ost Americans do not meet physical activity

(PA) guidelines.1 People live in neighbor-
hoods that are mosaics of modiÔ¨Åable2,3 built
environment (BE) features (e.g., walkability, access to
public transportation, public park, private recreation
facilities).4‚Äì7 Such features have been individually and
consistently linked to PA among adults8‚Äì13 and have
shown behavior-speciÔ¨Åc associations with different
domains of PA (e.g., recreation, transportation).8,13‚Äì17
Mixed evidence exists for relations of BEs with sedentary
behaviors and obesity.18‚Äì22
