What are your questions?

Which of these concepts are clear to you? Which aren’t?

What are new symbols of Lpred ?
How do sententials, predicates and the identity symbol =
relate to one another?
What are well-formed formulas of Lpred ?
How is the scope of a quantiﬁer deﬁned?
What’s diﬀerent about translations schemes in Lpred ?
What is regimented language? What is its purpose, what are
its limitations?

How do you formalize ”All foos are bars.”? How is this
diﬀerent from ”Some foos are bars.”

Formulas of Lpred

Which of these expressions are wﬀs of Lpred

1 ∀x(Fx → (Ga ∧ ¬∃yHxy ))
2 Ga = a

3 Gy
4 ∃x(¬x = b ∨ ∀xGx)
5 ¬a = b ∨ Fc

Formalization of English into Lpred

Given the scheme:
H: ... is higher than ... M: ... is a mountain E : ... is in England
W : ... is in Wales S: ... is in Scotland a: Snowdon b: Ben Nevis

1 No mountain is higher than itself.

2 Ben Nevis is at least as high as Snowdon.

3 Some mountain in Scotland is higher than any mountain in

England or Wales.

4 At least one mountain in Scotland other than Ben Nevis is

higher than all mountains in England or Wales.

5 For every mountain in England there is a higher mountain in

Scotland.
