Michel Foucault and Giorgio Agamben

*Mechanisms through which disciplinary
strategies were replaced by biopolitics
  - Understood as power over life

*Separation of the biological and the
political
  - All power is by its nature biopower 

Biopower and Migrants
*Preventive state: in order to protect the 
population's biological well-being it must
kill the other
  - Categorization between "us" and "them"
or between the "normal" (legal citizen) and
the "abnormal" (illegal immigrant)
