Statistical learning

extract statistical regularities from the world 
around them to learn about the environment

Introduction 

ÔÇó Human learners and infants are highly sensitive to 

structure in their environment 
 

ÔÇó High rapidity with which infants usually learn their 

native language 

   ‚Üí statistical learning mechanisms involved 
 
ÔÇó Regularities in environment provide probabilistic 

information regarding lexical category membership, 
grammatical structure as well as word meaning 

 
 
 

Introduction 

 
 
ÔÇó HOW does statistical learning contribute to language 

acquisition ? 
 

ÔÇó To which EXTENT  infants use statistical learning 

mechanisms to acquire their native language ?

UPWARD ‚Äì Applying statistical learning to 

different levels of language 

ÔÇó Classical studies of statistical language learning: 

sequential ordering of concrete elements 

ÔÇó It seems to also contribute to categorization of 

speech sounds, word and grammar learning 
 

ÔÇó How are language statistics represented and used for 

different levels of language? 

 

UPWARD ‚Äì Applying statistical learning to 

different levels of language 

ÔÇó Studies on word segmentation in the last decade: 

discrimination of words from part-words is taken as 
evidence of successful word discrimination 

ÔÇó Actually: discrimination of sound sequences with 

high vs. low TPs 
 

ÔÇó How can we test word segmentation more directly? 

UPWARD ‚Äì Applying statistical learning to 

different levels of language 

ÔÇó Experimental Paradigm: Artificial Language 

Learning 

ÔÇó Goal: study the processes that underlie language 

learning in a laboratory setting 

ÔÇó Training phase: habituation 
ÔÇó Test phase: new knowledge applied to same or 

different stimuli

different levels of language 

ÔÇó Graf Estes et al.: Word-segmentation with 17-month-

old infants 

ÔÇó Familiarization with a stream of continuous speech 

from a small artificial language, with only TP cues to 
word boundaries (1 vs. .33) 

ÔÇó Habituation to object labelling task with words vs. 

part-words as labels 

ÔÇó Same Condition: correct label-object pairs 
ÔÇó Switch Condition: incorrect (‚Äúswitched‚Äù) pairs

INWARD ‚Äì Statistical learning in the context of 

other learning mechanisms 

ÔÇó How is statistical learning related to other types of 

learning hypothesized to play a role in language 
acquisition? 
 

ÔÇó How, in particular, can we distinguish statistical and 

rule-based learning empirically? 

INWARD ‚Äì Statistical learning in the context of 

other learning mechanisms 

ÔÇó Marcus et al.: Familiarization with repetition 

grammars (ABA or ABB): wo fe wo or wo fe fe 

ÔÇó Infants successfully discriminated strings of novel 

syllables that followed the learned pattern from 
those that didn‚Äôt 
 

ÔÇó Assumption: Statistical learning is not enough to 

account for this 

INWARD ‚Äì Statistical learning in the context of 

other learning mechanisms 

ÔÇó Possible points of criticism to Marcus et al.: 

ÔÇ° statistical learning mechanisms are actually sufficient to 

explain the transfer 

ÔÇ° repetition-detection is an automatic process of the auditory 

perceptual system 

 

ÔÇó Instead of further behavioral experiments: modeling 

the task in a neural network 

 

INWARD ‚Äì Statistical learning in the context of 

other learning mechanisms 

ÔÇó How do infants know which regularities to track? 

 

ÔÇó Hypothesis: Properties of the input determine how 

it‚Äôs processed 

ÔÇó Investigated with nonadjacent dependencies (AXB) 
ÔÇó Hard to learn even for adults, but easier with 

grouping cues 

ÔÇó Ability to learn AXB pattern seems to develop 

around 15 or 16 months

OUTWARD ‚Äì Relating statistical learning to real-

world learning 

ÔÇó Usage of artificial languages instead of natural real-world 

language 

   ‚Üí synthesized speech streams or lack of typical  
         variability 
 
ÔÇó Applied learning mechanisms might differ for artificial 

language and natural language 

 
ÔÇó Realistic environment allows language acquisition to take 

place in context 
 

ÔÇó Concerns about representative design of studies 

 
 

OUTWARD ‚Äì Relating statistical learning to real-

world learning 

ÔÇó Combination of the control of an artificial language with 

variability of a natural language (infrequent target words in 
context of other phonemes etc.) 
 

ÔÇó Pelucchi et al.: statistical learning in a natural language by 

8-month-old infants 

 
ÔÇó Infants discriminated test words with high TP from equally 

frequent words with low TP 

    ‚Üí information tracking across natural produced speech 
         from a real language 

 
 

OUTWARD ‚Äì Relating statistical learning to real-

world learning 

ÔÇó Correlated, multiple cues typically facilitate learning 
    ‚Üí regularities from speech + irregularities in the environment 

 

ÔÇó Scope of studies tends to incorporate more of the rich 

environment 

Cross-situational statistics  
is a mechanism for learning the meaning of 
words across multiple exposures, despite 
referential uncertainty 

 
 
 
 
 
‚Üí determination of most probable referent by intersecting  
      the various sets of candidate referents
