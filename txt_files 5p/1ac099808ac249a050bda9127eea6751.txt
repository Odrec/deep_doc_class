INTRODUCTION: Different lines of research suggest that altered states of consciousness (ASCs) could be
used for therapeutic purposes1 because they might have the ability to trigger different viewpoints in
the subject that receives the therapy, and since the individual's perspective is an important aspect in
(the treatment of) most psychological disorders this might help to relieve symptoms. This review will
give   a  short   overview  on  some  induction  methods   that  could  be   relevant   for  clinical   uses,  two
pharmaceutical   and   one   non-pharmaceutical   ones,   namely   MDMA,   LSD/Psilocybin   and   sleep
deprivation. After a short summary on the topic of ASCs (1), I will review those three different types of
induction methods (MDMA (2), LSD/Psilocybin (3), and sleep deprivation (4)) regarding their relevance
for psychotherapy.
1) ALTERED STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS: When talking about altered states of consciousness, one first
has to define what an 'altered' state of consciousness is. That means, a definition of a 'normal' or
'regular' state of consciousness is needed so one can see if deviations from this 'normal' state can be
categorized   accordingly.   Since   everyday   subjective   experiences   underlie   fluctuations   triggered   by
external and internal influences2, one needs to determine a 'baseline' level for every subject to relate
experimentally induced ASCs to and evaluate experimental data, and then need ASCs that have a short
duration (as opposed to pathologic conditions) to study them experimentally. A baseline level should
be   measured   while   the   subject   is   as   calm   and   cognitively   as   well   as   physically   unengaged   and
stressfree, since even a small uneasiness or uncontrolled motion can produce artifacts that will distort
the result and function as a counfounding variable. 
ASCs have been embedded in different cultures in religious or medical procedures for ages before
people in the western world like Albert Hofmann discovered new ways of inducing them. In the
western world and outside of the chemistry lab, those substances were mainly used for recreational
purposes and after some time their users faced huge obstacles because of restricted social acceptance
of those substances. Facing these problems regarding the handling of psychoactive substances, an idea
like the 'LSD driver's license' evolved, the idea that people could get non-prosecuted access to certain
substances   after   they   complete   a   course   for   save   usage   and   get   their   'driver's   license'   for   the
substance. One argument for the demanded liberalization of drug policies has been the idea that, using
a rational scale to assess the harm of drugs, there are many activities that are much more dangerous
than using pharmacological substance to achieve ASCs but do not require any form of formal training,
horse riding for example3. Furthermore,  there were no useful guidelines to safe administration, which
would be a prerequisite to control the risks of those substances. While many methods used to induce
ASCs are of pharmacological nature (like taking LSD, Psilocybin or MDMA), there are also some non-
pharmacological ones like holotropic breathwork (Stanislav Grof), Kundalini Yoga (wich also relies

heavily on breathwork to achieve an ASC), Ganzfeld-experiments or lying in a deprivation tank.
When talking about ASCs, we have to consider that we talk about a complex system with many possible
unknown   parameters   involved.   So,   what   one   needs   to   do   when   researching   in   the   field   of
consciousness or ASCs, is studying 'phenomenoconnectomics', that is to research the alterations of
connections in the brain using imaging techniques regarding to a baseline (for example resting-state
fMRI)   (connectomics)   while   accessing   the   behaviour   and   introspection   of   the   subjects
(phenomenology). To access a subject's introspection, one needs to use an evaluation method such as
the OAV or the PCI4, both questionnaires pertaining the level of attention to the external world and the
kind of internal awareness of the subject  as well as perceived self-control, with parameters like
'disembodiment' or 'vivid imagery'. Of course the access of introspection is always limited because
subjects are prone to self-censorship, forgetting certain aspects of the experience or being faced with
desription difficulties, to name only some of the difficulties researchers of those subjective experiences
are faced with. To find the real neural correlates of (altered states of) consciousness in imaging
techniques seems like a more reasonable and scientific endeavour but one needs to consider that
there are so many possible parameters to be observed that a complete, definite picture of a state of
consciousness might never be established. We do not only have to observe single signals in the brain,
but compute the changing functional connectivity of (at least) different brain regions.
2) MDMA: In 1986, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychodelic Studies (MAPS)was founded. Aim
of this association is to influence the form of psychotherapy, to further the awareness of the use of
psychodelic substances in therapeutical contexts and to develop the use of NMDA into prescription
medicine. To achieve this, the association has set up a plan with different stages and is now in phase
two of their project, having completed a pilot study on 12 subjects (Mithoefer et al., 2013).
MDMA could be used in psychotherapy because it increases the level of trust of an indivual via
decreasing the activity in the amygdala and could so be used to access deeper memories of the
subjects without fear and without getting overwhelmed by their trauma. In an experiment, subjects
with a chronic, treatment-restistant form of PTSD treated with MDMA showed a greater improvement
of symptoms than a control group, without showing serious adverse events  (Milthoefer et al., 2010). 
3) LSD/Psilocybin: The idea that psychodelic substances can be used in psychotherapy stems from the
observation that one the one hand, there is a kind of 'psychodelic healing' during the usage of such
substances in religious contexts, for example in native american cultures (Griffith et al., 2006), and on
the other hand that those substances can induce psychosis-like states, so they could give insight to
possible neural mechanisms that lead to psychosis (e.g. metabolic  alteration that  leads to acute

symptoms) (Vollenweider et al., 1998).
There   are   two   different   therapeutic   approaches   to   clinical   trials   for   psychotherapy,   one   is   the
psycholytic, the other the psychedelic therapy5. During the psycholytic therapy, only a small amount of
the psychodelic substance is administered and that administration is repeated multiple times. This
therapy is suited to treat disorders in which there is a relatively stable connection to reality and in wich
it seems adequate to maintain this relation. In the psychodelic therapy, on the other hand, a higher
dosage of the substance is used, but only for once during the psychotherapy. The aim of this form of
substance-assisted psychotherapy is to loosen the contact to reality of the substance and to produce an
'insight'-moment in the patient that leads to an experience of religious-like conversion, so as to convert
them from alcohol abuse for example. While this is the positive peak experience when used in a
subject with a history of alcohol abuse, this method also has a negative peak experience, it worsens the
symptoms of alcohol withdrawal (e.g. delirium tremens) and thus inducing a highly aversive state that
led to quitting drinking ans preventing a relapse in alcoholics6. It was also reported that a high dosage
of psilocybin can reduce the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (Moreno et al., 2006).
4) Sleep deprivation: While the amount of sleep a human needs is different for every individual, it is
known that sleep deprivation has negative effects on our behaviour and well-being and chronic sleep
deprivation can lead to serious health problems, it increases the likelihood to get type II-diabetes or
cardiac   diseases   and   has   an   effect   on   metabolic   and   endocrine   function   (Spiegel   et   al.,   1999;
Mullington et al., 2009). It also has a huge effect on our cognitive abilities: after one night of sleep
deprivation,  we   see   a   decline   of  cognitive   performance   in   test   batteries   like   the   Luria-Nebraska
neuropsychological battery (LNNB), where subjects are tested for their abilities in 14 different subtypes
of abilities like arithmetic, memory or receptive and expressive speech (Kim et al., 2001).
An experiment conducted by  Williamson and Feyer7  compared the effects of sleep deprivation and
alcohol consumption on different human abilities, measured, inter alia, by different vigilance, attention
and response speed tests. It was shown that sleep deprivation does show similar effects as alcohol
consumption, namely after being awake for 17 to 19 hours, subjects' performance resembled those's
who had a blood alcohol concentration of 0,05% (Williamson&Feyer, 2000). This shows that sleep
deprivation can be seen as a non-pharmacological method to induce an ASC but unlike the studies for
MDMA and LSD/Psilocybin, different measures were used to get the results: whereas those studies
focussed mainly on phenomenology and brain function as can be accesed by imaging techniques, the
study about sleep deprivation focused on the performance of the subjects during multiple tests.

CONCLUSION: It could be argued that all induction methods should be compared using the exact same
methodical instruments (and retrieving values for comparable parameters) to get results that enable us
to establish a common basis for studying ASCs. We could also argue that we have to use different
induction methods on the same subjects to get an even better comparability of results for induction
methods and effects and it should be kept in mind that the use and effects of psychodelic substances
might be highly individual. Moreover, psychodelic substances seem like they could provide adequate
resources for the use in psychotherapy and one could argue that while research in this direction should
be expanded, more work is needed to improve the safe administration and social acceptance of those
substances.
