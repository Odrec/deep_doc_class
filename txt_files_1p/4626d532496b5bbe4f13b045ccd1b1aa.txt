           assignment 8: negation 

             due Saturday 

 

1. Identity the monotonicity properties of the following quantifiers. Justify your answer for one of 
them by applying the definition of left/right downward/upward monotonicity. (5 points) 

 

a.  at least two: left upward monotonic, right upward monotonic 

At least two students of cognitive science showed up. ==> / <=/= At least two students showed up. 

At least two students submitted a term paper on linguistics. ==> / <=/= At least two students 
submitted a term paper.  

 

c. neither: left downward monotonic, right downward monotonic 

Neither student of cognitive science showed up. =/=> / <== Neither student showed up. 

Neither student submitted a term paper on linguistics. =/=> / <== Neither student submitted a 
term paper. 

 

e. few: left downward monotonic, right downward monotonic 

Few students of cognitive science showed up. =/=> / <== Few students showed up. 

Few students submitted a term paper on linguistics. =/=> / <== Few students submitted a term 
paper. 

 

2. Identify whether negation in the following sentences is metalinguistic, and if yes, identify the kind 
of form/meaning that it is used to cancel, i.e. whether it is a CP, a CI, a conversational implicature, or 
involves a correction of grammar/style. (5 points) 

 

a. Max doesn’t have three children – he has four. 

Answer:  yes.  The  metalinguistic  negation  is  used  to  cancel  the  scalar  implicature  of  the  first 
utterance, i.e. Max doesn’t have more than three children. 

 

 

b. It is not possible that Chris will win. Chris will certainly win. 

Answer:  yes.  The  metalinguistic  negation  is  used  to  cancel  the  scalar  implicature  that  it  is  not 
certain that Chris will win.
