REPRODUCING AND RESHAPING ETHNIC 

RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION IN STOCKHOLM: 
THE ROLE OF SELECTIVE MIGRATION MOVES

ANDERSSON, R. (2013): ‘Reproducing and reshaping ethnic res­
idential segregation in Stockholm: the role of selective migration 
moves’,  Geografiska  Annaler:  Series  B,  Human  Geography  95 
(2):163–187.

ABSTRACT. This paper deals with the issues of selective migra­
tion moves, and the production and reproduction of immigrant-
dense neighbourhoods in Stockholm, Sweden. It has been shown 
earlier that selective migration, that is, socioeconomic and eth­
nic  differences  between  those  leaving,  entering  and  staying  in 
so-called deprived neighbourhoods, reproduces these neighbour­
hoods’ characteristics of being poor and immigrant dense. Key 
concepts launched to inform such studies and derived from the US 
segregation discourse are “white flight” and “white avoidance”, 
meaning that native people (or white people in the US case) tend 
to leave neighbourhoods experiencing growing numbers of im­
migrants (black people) and which they also tend to avoid mov­
ing into such neighbourhoods. Using a complete set of geo-coded 
longitudinal individual data for the 2005–2008 Stockholm County 
population, this paper contributes to our understanding of ethnic 
differences in the intra-urban migration system. Three empirical 
questions  are  addressed:  what  individual  characteristics  distin­
guish (1) those who move into neighbourhoods experiencing rap­
idly increasing immigrant densities from those moving elsewhere 
in the urban region; (2) those who leave neighbourhoods expe­
riencing rapidly increasing immigrant densities from those who 
stay put; (3) those who move in the direction of higher immigrant 
densities from those moving into lower densities? Results from 
multivariate statistical analyses provide support for the avoidance 
hypothesis but less support for the flight hypothesis. When con­
trolling  for  a  range  of  individual  and  neighbourhood  attributes 
there is clear evidence that native-born Swedes are less inclined 
than most immigrant categories to move into immigrant dense are­
as while ethnic origin does not seem to matter much when explain­
ing who leaves such areas.

Introduction
Ethnic residential segregation is a concern for pol­
iticians  and  urban  planners  and  has  consequently 
generated  substantial  interest  from  researchers  in 
different social science disciplines and in a grow­
ing number of countries. While this issue has long 
been on the agenda, especially in the USA and South 
Africa, rather limited interest was paid to segrega­
tion in European countries before the 1990s. Now, 

following  from  a  discourse  that  links  segregation 
with the perceived failure of integrating immigrants 
into host societies, the issue is vividly debated in 
countries such as France, the UK, the Netherlands, 
Belgium, Germany, and in Scandinavian countries 
including Sweden (Bolt et al. 2010). The topic is 
also increasingly discussed in Southern Europe, not 
least in the context of the financial crisis and rising 
inequalities (Arapoglou 2012; Kandylis et al. 2012).
 
If  one  believes  that  spatial  segregation  is  the 
cause of the lack of integration characterizing life 
for many immigrants – especially more recently ar­
rived refugee immigrants from the Middle East and 
Africa – it is natural to try to affect segregation pat­
terns  and  processes.  Such  attempts  take  different 
forms: housing mix programmes, (refugee) settle­
ment and dispersal policies, area-based urban pro­
grammes (Andersson et al. 2010). However, before 
engaging further in a debate concerning measures 
to avoid or mitigate segregation processes, the re­
search community needs to better analyse the dy­
namic  component  that  shapes  and  reproduces 
neighbourhood  population  compositions  and  the 
segregated city: migration. Without such process-
related knowledge – and of course more knowledge 
about whether ethnic segregation is harmful or not 
and for whom – policy interventions might be inef­
fective or even counter-productive. This article con­
tributes to the development of such process- related 
knowledge  while  leaving  the  consequence  issue 
aside.
 
It has been shown (Andersson and Bråmå 2004; 
Bråmå 2006; see also Wilson 1987; Jargovsky 1997; 
Bolt et al. 2008; Card et al. 2008) that selective mi­
gration,  that  is,  socioeconomic  and  ethnic  differ­
ences between those leaving, entering and staying 
in so-called deprived neighbourhoods, reproduces 
these neighbourhoods’ characteristics of being poor 
and immigrant dense. Key concepts launched to in­
form such studies and derived from the US discourse 
are “white flight” and “white avoidance” (see Ellen

2000), meaning that native people (or “whites” in 
the US case) tend to leave neighbourhoods experi­
encing growing numbers of immigrants (“blacks”) 
and that they also tend to avoid moving into such 
neighbourhoods. Especially the flight notion often 
contains some kind of idea about thresholds, mean­
ing that whites start to move out in bigger numbers 
if the proportion of blacks exceeds a certain level 
(Card et al. 2008). In contrast to discourses of eth­
nic “self-segregation” that have given rise ‘to the 
myth that minority ethnic communities live, or wish 
to live, separate lives and disengage from wider …. 
society’ (Phillips 2006, p. 36), this author believes 
it is correct to place much focus on the natives’ (or 
the  majority’s)  role  in  producing  ethnic  residen­
tial segregation. This is also in line with the stand­
point put forward by Crowder et al. (2011, p. 41): 
‘While scholarly attention continues to focus on im­
migrants’ residential attainment processes, we call 
for additional attention to native-born populations’ 
mobility  reactions  to  these  immigrant  settlement 
patterns.’ While acknowledging the natives’ role we 
need to take the departure in the fact that segrega­
tion processes operate in cities comprising a system 
of neighbourhoods: what takes place in poor and/or 
immigrant-dense neighbourhoods is very much re­
lated to what takes place in other neighbourhoods 
(Jargovsky 1997, ch. 6; Bråmå 2011).
 
The new forms of diversity and multiculturalism 
in society are expected to influence residential loca­
tion decisions, and the ways in which immigrants 
and  natives  interact  in  neighbourhoods,  schools, 
playgrounds  and  workplaces.  Such  interaction,  in 
turn, has direct bearings on social cohesion and in­
tergroup understanding and tolerance (Wessel 2009; 
Galster  et  al.  2010).  In  the  Norface-funded  com­
parative research project NODES (Nordic welfare 
states and the dynamics and effects of ethnic resi­
dential segregation) we aim to study the dynamics 
and effects of ethnic residential segregation in four 
Nordic countries. This particular article has been de­
veloped in this research context and deals with the 
issues of selective migration moves, and the produc­
tion  and  reproduction  of  immigrant-dense  neigh­
bourhoods in Stockholm, Sweden.
Selective migration among natives, and its ef­
 
fects  upon  ethnic  segregation,  is  a  relatively  new 
field  of  research  in  the  Nordic  context.  Bråmå 
(2006) has analysed the role of Swedish majority 
populations.  She  concludes  that  selective  in-mi­
gration (particularly avoidance), and not selective 
out- migration (flight), is the main driver behind the 

production and reproduction of immigrant concen­
trations in contemporary Sweden. A study of school 
segregation in Oslo (Sundell 2008) produced simi­
lar results, although with a greater emphasis on se­
lective out-migration (i.e. the flight mechanism).
  Vilkama  (2010,  2011)  shows  that  despite 
Helsinki’s  much  lower  proportion  of  immigrants, 
both flight and avoidance are relevant concepts also 
in that context. She furthermore confirms what has 
also  been  found  for  Sweden:  out-migration  rates 
from  immigrant-dense  neighbourhoods  are  simi­
lar for immigrants and natives but immigrants tend 
to more often circulate within the same segment of 
neighbourhoods,  that  is  to  say,  immigrant-dense 
neighbourhoods (see also Jargovsky 1997).
  Other studies have documented selective migra­
tion among immigrants. Magnusson and Özüekren 
(2002) examined intra-urban mobility during 1975–
1990 among Turkish immigrants in three middle-
sized  Swedish  cities. Their  results  show  a  highly 
concentrated pattern of mobility. Later research in 
Sweden (see Andersson and Bråmå 2004), Denmark 
(Skifter Andersen 2010) and Norway (Blom 2006) 
present a more split picture: older, established im­
migrants tend to leave distressed/multiethnic areas, 
while recently arrived immigrants gravitate (volun­
tarily and/or are steered through institutional prac­
tices) towards these places. Skifter Andersen (2010), 
studying such housing estates in Denmark, stresses 
the importance of preferences, such as the desirabil­
ity for certain neighbourhood compositions. Many 
others have contributed to the research field, focus­
ing  on  for  instance  out-mobility  from  immigrant 
dense  and/or  socioeconomically  deprived  neigh­
bourhoods  and  on  the  effects  of  neighbourhood 
compositional change (Charles 2000; Clark 2002; 
Meen et al. 2005; Bailey and Livingston 2008; van 
Ham and Feijten 2008; Feijten and van Ham 2009; 
van Ham and Clark 2009; Pais et al. 2009; Crowder 
et al. 2011; Saiz and Wachter 2011).
This article will make use of longitudinal reg­
 
ister data and it aims at describing and analysing 
the ethnic compositional dynamics going on in the 
system  of  neighbourhoods  in  the  Stockholm  re­
gion. The key research question is whether native 
Swedes contribute to sustaining and reinforcing eth­
nic residential segregation by avoiding and leaving 
neighbourhoods that experience high and increasing 
immigrant density. The hypothesis is that this is in­
deed the case.
The empirical study will be carried out in three 
 
steps. The first is to identify neighbourhoods that

rapidly turn more or less immigrant dense. This is 
done in the third section by using population reg­
ister data for Stockholm County on 31 December, 
in 2005 and 2008. I select a set of neighbourhoods 
meeting the requirement that they have undergone 
change in the proportion of non-Nordic born resi­
dents that is clearly above or below the mean during 
this three-year period. I then analyse in-migration 
and out-migration from these neighbourhoods by 
broad ethnic categories in order to identify whether 
this compositional change is attributable to in situ 
changes  (deaths/births)  or  whether  it  is  caused 
by  selective  migration,  that  is,  ethnic  differences 
among those entering and leaving different types of 
neighbourhoods. In the subsequent section, I also 
conduct  two  logistic  regression  analyses  of  resi­
dents moving into and out of neighbourhoods ex­
periencing a clearly above average growth in the 
share  of  residents  born  outside  of  the  Nordic  re­
gion. This and a final analysis (in the penultimate 
section) comparing those moving into lower with 
those moving into higher immigrant density areas 
are confined to residents living in the region both in 
2005 and in 2008. The concluding section summa­
rizes the main findings.
 
The analyses of selective migration are based on 
a complete set of individual, longitudinal data for 
people living in Stockholm County at both points in 
time (2005 and 2008). Using a three-year period is 
in a sense arbitrary, but any period could be said to 
be arbitrary. However, it is one way to avoid prob­
lems relating to the representativeness of the regis­
ters. It is far more likely that people who actually 
have moved will be picked up in the address reg­
ister if one allows for more than one year between 
the measurement points. Applying a longer period, 
say five to ten years, would mean that “return mov­
ers”  are  disregarded  and  that  those  moving  more 
than  once  will  be  identified  as  having  made  only 
one  move.  Admittedly,  this  might  be  a  problem 
with the three-year span, but certainly less severe. 
Furthermore, the regression analyses are delimited 
to residents aged 25–50 in 2005, focusing on adults 
in age groups that are active in the labour market 
and that might have children of school age. Younger 
adults comprise a substantial proportion of students, 
whose housing situation is volatile, unsecure and of­
ten of a temporary character. Quite a number of them 
can be hypothesized not to live where they are for­
mally registered.

Segregation in Stockholm: a background
The  proportion  of  foreign  born  has  increased  for 
a long period of time in the Stockholm region and 
stood at 21.3 per cent in 2008. Naturally, the pro­
portion would be higher if second-generation im­
migrants were included. Earlier studies have shown 
that neither early nor more recently arrived immi­
grants  are  evenly  distributed  over  municipalities 
and neighbourhoods. Like in many other European 
countries  (see  Musterd  2005),  segregation  has 
emerged as a key political issue over the past two 
decades and a series of counter-segregation policies 
have been launched, some of them targeting specific 
areas in the city (for an overview and further ref­
erences on Sweden, see Andersson 2006; Palander 
2006; Andersson et al. 2010).
Like  most  of  Europe,  Sweden  does  not  have 
 
mono-ethnic clusters of immigrants (i.e. one single 
ethnic  group  dominating  a  neighbourhood  or  dis­
trict). It is indeed difficult to find neighbourhoods 
having more than 10 per cent of the population origi­
nating in a specific foreign country (Andersson et al. 
forthcoming). What is a fact, however, is that resi­
dents from some parts of the world – typically from 
Muslim  countries  –  are  highly  concentrated  into 
neighbourhoods which have high overall immigrant 
density. Such areas are often located on the periph­
ery of towns and cities, and many were constructed 
as part of the infamous Million Homes Programme 
initiated by the Social Democratic government in 
the mid-1960s. This programme was a national po­
litical project that aimed at modernizing the hous­
ing stock and reducing scarcity of housing following 
urbanization  and  the  demographic  shift  towards 
smaller  households.  Rental  housing  dominates  in 
these areas, but cooperative housing (bostadsrätt, a 
market form whereby the right to dispose of a partic­
ular dwelling is tradable while the property is owned 
and managed collectively by all the residents in the 
cooperative) is not unusual and sometimes amounts 
to 20–30 per cent of the dwellings.
 
These  immigrant-dense  housing  estates  have 
been characterized as transit areas, or ports of entry, 
for newcomers to a city and it is a fact that turnover 
rates are high and that typically half the population of a 
particular area will have moved out within a five to six 
years (Andersson and Bråmå 2004; Andersson 2008). 
It has been argued that the reproduction of the areas’ 
characteristics of being income poor and immigrant 
dense is due to a constant influx of newly arrived refu­
gees (and subsequent immigration due to family ties) 
and selective migration (see Andersson and Bråmå

2004; Bråmå 2006), whereby those who succeed eco­
nomically relatively well tend to quickly leave the 
areas. In this sense, the spatial assimilation thesis – 
which states that upward social mobility among mi­
norities translates into residential integration – seems 
to hold true also for the Swedish case (for literature 
on the spatial assimilation thesis, see Massey 1985; 
Massey and Denton 1985; South et al. 2008; and for a 
couple of Scandinavian studies, see Skifter Andersen 
2010; Magnusson Turner and Wessel 2013).
 
The  concentration  of  different  minorities  in 
these areas differs quite substantially and the neigh­
bourhood sorting results in something that could be 
called  an  ethnic  hierarchy.  Residents  originating 
in Somalia, Iraq and some other primarily Muslim 
countries live more at a distance from native Swedes 
than do for instance European migrants, an impor­
tant part of the reason being their much lower pres­
ence in the labour market, and consequently, their 
low work income and constrained housing choices.

Selective migration in relation to

change 
Identifying neighbourhoods
In  2005,  Stockholm  County  had  close  to  1.9  mil­
lion inhabitants distributed over 875 neighbourhoods 
(SAMS-områden, Small Area Market Statistics). The 

average population size of each neighbourhood was 
about 2150, and the average neighbourhood had 11.6 
per  cent  non-Nordic-born  residents.  From  2005  to 
2008,  the  population  increased  by  90,000,  half  of 
which were non-Nordic born, resulting in an overall 
increase in average percentage non-Nordic residents 
in neighbourhoods to 13.8 per cent. Excluding neigh­
bourhoods having less than 30 inhabitants in 2005 
and 2008, the average neighbourhood experienced a 
net increase by 1.6 percentage points non-Nordic res­
idents between 2005 and 2008 (see Table 1).
Primarily due to the overall growth of the num­
 
ber of non-Nordic residents, most neighbourhoods 
saw an increase in their share during the period. In 
total,  30  neighbourhoods,  with  a  total  population 
of around 75,000 experienced a rapid increase, in 
other words, they had a growth exceeding 2 stand­
ard deviations above the mean. Their average share 
of  non-Nordic  residents  grew  from  25.5  to  34.7 
per cent. With only a handful of exceptions, most 
of  these  neighbourhoods  were  already  immigrant 
dense in 2005 (19 of the 30 belonged to the upper 
decile in terms of percentage non-Nordic residents 
in 2005). Another 50 neighbourhoods experienced 
an increase clearly above the mean (Type 2 in Table 
2). Here, the percentage non-Nordic-born residents 
increased from 20 to nearly 25 per cent. Four out of 
five neighbourhoods are defined as stable in Table 
2 (Type 3), meaning that their change is within the

span of 1 standard deviation above or below the mean 
(–0.8 to +4.0 change in the share of non- Nordic res­
idents). Type 4 neighbourhoods experienced a de­
cline but within the span of 1–2 standard deviations 
below the mean (–0.8 to –3.2). Finally, another 10 
neighbourhoods saw a substantial relative decline of 
non-Nordic residents (Type 5). Their average share 
of non-Nordic residents dropped from 19.1 to 13.2 
per cent. In total, these neighbourhoods had much 
fewer residents and the average population size was 
less than 500 people. More information on the geo­
graphical and housing characteristics of these dif­
ferent neighbourhood types will be provided under 
the heading “Location and housing characteristics” 
below.
  Before turning to migration balances, the issue 
of natural population change has to be commented 
upon. The way I define ethnic background here – us­
ing country of birth information – means that there 
could be no population addition of non-Nordic res­
idents due to births. All born in any neighbourhood 
will be registered as born in Sweden. All cases of 
relative  increase  in  the  proportion  of  non-Nordic 
residents are thereby caused either by selective mi­
gration within the region or by selective migration 
to the region from the outside world. It should be 

noted that Statistics Sweden does not collect (self-
reported)  data  on  ethnic  identity.  The  population 
register  contains  information  about  all  residents’ 
country of birth (CoB) and also the CoB of every­
one’s father and mother. (For a European compara­
tive overview of data on ethnicity and immigrants, 
see Jacobs et al. 2009.)
Tables 3 and 4 report on population change by 
 
providing data on in- and out-migration by neighbour­
hood  trajectory  type.  Table  3  shows  intra- regional 
change,  that  is,  migration  data  for  those  living  in 
the region in 2005 as well as in 2008, while Table 4 
shows the distribution over neighbourhood types for 
all newcomers to the region (inter-regional change) 
by region of birth. Out-migration in Table 3 means 
that someone lived in a certain neighbourhood type in 
2005 and relocated to another type during the 2005–
2008 period. In-migrants are defined analogously and 
a stayer is defined as someone who lived in the same 
neighbourhood type at both points in time. These def­
initions  mean  that  I  disregard  all  migration  taking 
place within each neighbourhood type; hence, net mi­
gration for a specific neighbourhood type can be pos­
itive or negative, but total net migration in Table 3 is 
by definition zero (see last column).

than white flight is a key concept for interpreting 
migration behaviour of native Swedes, in partic­
ular in relation to already immigrant-dense neigh­
bourhoods.  To  state  this  simply:  native  Swedes 
avoid  moving  into  immigrant-dense  neighbour­
hoods. She argues that ethnic differences are more 
pronounced for in-migration rates to such neigh­
bourhoods (avoidance) than they are for the rates 
of out- migration (flight). Table 4 shows that out-
migration  rates  from  neighbourhoods  experienc­
ing a rapid increase in the non-Nordic population 
are clearly higher for Nordic-born residents com­
pared with those for non-Nordic immigrants while 
in- migration  rates  are  also  distinctively  lower. 
Swedes  and  Nordic-born  residents  relocate  from 
neighbourhoods  experiencing  increasing  propor­
tions  of  non-Nordic  residents  in  the  direction  of 
neighbourhoods  experiencing  average  or  declin­
ing rates of non- Nordic residents. One can thus ar­
gue that these data support both the flight and the 

avoidance  hypotheses.  It  is  however  important 
to  stress  that  the  neighbourhood  type  experienc­
ing a fast increase in the proportion of non-Nordic 
residents  also  experiences  a  net  loss  of  intra-ur­
ban non-Nordic movers. So why does the propor­
tion of non-Nordic residents grow rapidly in these 
neighbourhoods?
The answer is that it is not due to natural change 
 
and only partially due to intra-urban selective mi­
gration.  The  most  important  factor  is  attributable 
to the inter-regional dimension; in other words, se­
lective  destinations  for  in-migrants  from  the  rest 
of Sweden and directly from abroad. Before turn­
ing to this issue, it is worth noting (see last column 
in Table 3) that non-Nordic residents move twice as 
often between neighbourhood types as natives and 
Nordic-born  residents.  This  result  is  in  line  with 
other Swedish studies. Andersson (2012) finds that 
most immigrant categories in Sweden show a much 
higher rate of internal migration – irrespective of

distance – and that these differences remain also af­
ter controlling for a wide range of demographic and 
socioeconomic attributes.
The rapid increase in the non-Nordic popula­
 
tion in certain neighbourhoods is to a high degree 
related to the neighbourhood destination of new­
comers to the region: new immigrants tend to clus­
ter  in  already  immigrant-dense  neighbourhoods. 
Theoretically,  this  could  be  either  voluntarily  or 
due to lack of choice, but Swedish research now­
adays  mostly  argues  for  seeking  explanations  in 
the realms of institutional racism, structural sub­
ordination, and migration behaviour of the native 
population  (Molina  1997;  Pred  2000; Andersson 
2007).
 
Table 4 shows that while less than 10 per cent 
of  all  Swedish-born  newcomers  settled  in  neigh­
bourhoods experiencing an above average increase 
in the non-Nordic population from 2005 to 2008, 
more than 40 per cent of new immigrants originat­
ing in Western Asia and North Africa moved into 
these  neighbourhoods.  Corresponding  values  are 
also  high  for  migrants  from  sub-Saharan  Africa 
(30%), from Eastern Europe (30%) and from other 
non-Western countries (around 25%), while they are 
substantially lower for native (10%) and Nordic and 
West European migrants (12–13%).
  Out-migration from the different neighbourhood 
types to destinations outside of the region (including 
emigration) is also shown in Table 4. It is obviously 
the case that out-migration is also somewhat selec­
tive, but ethnic differences are much smaller com­
pared with those found for the in- migration rates. 
While  the  net  value  for  native  Swedes  is  around 
–1,000  for  neighbourhood  Types  1  and  2  com­
bined,  immigrants  from  the  Middle  East,  Africa 
and Eastern Europe give a net contribution to these 
neighbourhoods  from  inter-regional  exchange  by 
around 14,000 residents.

To summarize these findings:

DD Neighbourhood Types 1 and 2 lose native Swe­
des  in  the  intra-regional  as  well  as  the  inter- 
regional  migration  exchange  but  the  loss 
is  much  bigger  for  intra-regional  exchange 
(–8,000 compared with –1,000).

DD Neighbourhood Types 1 and 2 show a balance 
in  the  intra-regional  migration  exchange  for 
non-Nordic immigrants but these migrants con­
tribute with 14,000 new residents in the inter- 
regional migration exchange.

DD The increase in the proportion of non-Nordic re­
sidents in certain neighbourhoods seems to be 
a combined result of native Swedes leaving or 
avoiding these neighbourhoods for other desti­
nations within the region, and the pronounced 
selectivity  in  destination  patterns  for  natives 
and  non-Nordic  migrants  entering  the  region 
from  abroad  or  from  other  places  of  origin 
within Sweden.

Table 5 provides an overview of some key data gen­
erated from the tables above. Most details are al­
ready  discussed,  but  it  is  worth  stressing  the  key 
importance of the two final rows in the table. The 
Stockholm region has been growing for a very long 
period of time. For the last decades, this growth has 
been driven by immigration. While the region year 
by year tends to have a balance vis-à-vis the out­
side world in the exchange of native Swedes, the 
net contribution to population growth comes from a 
substantial surplus in the migration exchange of im­
migrants. Future population dynamics of the region 
will to a high extent depend on the level of immigra­
tion, but also on intra-regional mobility patterns of 
natives and immigrants. Due to the fact that immi­
grants are much more geographically mobile – espe­
cially in the years after immigration – their potential 
for reshaping residential patterns is bigger than is in­
dicated by their numbers as such.

Location and housing characteristics of the growth 
and decline group
As stated above, most neighbourhoods experienc­
ing a rapid increase in the share of non-Nordic mi­
grants from 2005 to 2008 were also immigrant dense 
in 2005. Many, but not all, belonged to the group 
of neighbourhoods having the very highest concen­
tration of immigrants (upper decile, see Fig. 1). In 
almost all other cases they are located in geographi­
cal proximity to the most immigrant-dense areas and 
their development could be characterized as a type 
of  spill- over  effect  from  these  areas.  Immigrant- 
dense  clusters  are  thus  expanding  geographically, 
but  population  density  has  also  increased  within 
the  clusters  so  that  many  neighbourhoods  experi­
ence problems with overcrowding. The geograph­
ical  location  of  all  81  neighbourhoods  belonging 
to the upper decile are shown in Figure 1 in terms 
of percentage of non-Nordic residents in 2005, and 
also those neighbourhoods not belonging to this seg­
ment but which did experience a fast increase in the

percentage  of  non-Nordic  residents  from  2005  to 
2008 (Types 1 and 2, see above).
 
Table  6  displays  information  on  key  demo­
graphic  and  socioeconomic  indicators.  There  are 
of  course  variations  in  each  type  of  neighbour­
hood, but the overall differences between the types 
are profound. Neighbourhoods experiencing rapid 
growth of their non-Nordic population have a much 
higher  proportion  of  rental  dwellings,  their  resi­
dents have a lower level of education, have lower 
employment rates, and partly following from this, 
lower work incomes. It is likely that the fact that 
many immigrants sort into these neighbourhoods is 
a combination of lack of economic resources (mak­
ing it difficult for them to access housing other than 
rental housing or relatively cheap cooperative hous­
ing), and other constraints (including discrimina­
tion, lack of information/less developed networks). 
The subsequent multivariate analyses can hopefully 
provide an improved understanding of the sorting 
process.

Intra-regional selective migration: a 
multivariate analysis
This  section  aims  to  identify  the  individual  char­
acteristics  which  tend  to  increase  or  decrease  the 
probability of moving into and leaving the segment 
of neighbourhoods that rapidly increase their pro­
portion of non-Nordic residents (Type 1 above). I 
am particularly interested in the selection going on 
within the region; that is to say, in the intra- regional 
migration system, and among residents aged 25–50.
The  flight–avoidance  hypotheses  are  primar­
 
ily derived from analyses of intra-urban and intra- 
regional migration studies; they are not relevant for 
all sorts of migration (however see Frey 1995; and 
Frey and Liaw 1998; Borjas 2006, who situate the 
flight concept in the context of inter-regional mi­
gration within the USA). The reason is that flight 
has to do with a notion of peoples’ experiences and 
that out-migration from a particular neighbourhood 
could be viewed as a reaction to the conditions – or 
to changing conditions – within the neighbourhood

(Feijten and van Ham 2009). Avoidance has more 
to  do  with  rumours,  territorial  stigmatization  and 
perceived  but  not  necessarily  self-experienced 
“problems” attributable to the ethnic composition. 
Although such perceptions could be held by people 
living outside the urban region (primarily because 
many neighbourhoods have been exposed and stig­
matized in national media; see Ericsson et al. 2002), 
it is likely that they are much more common among 

residents living in the region. It was demonstrated 
above that the flow of in-migrants from outside the 
region is an important factor for reproducing ethnic 
residential segregation. It is hypothesized that this 
flow – especially the inflow from abroad – needs to 
be understood less from the perspective of flight and 
avoidance, but rather from acknowledging the im­
portance of the severe constraints facing newly ar­
rived migrants. Most of them simply lack housing

alternatives and cannot be regarded to have made an 
active choice of where to settle.
 
There is also a practical aspect of the choice to fo­
cus on intra-regional migration. If in-migrants from 
abroad  were  to  be  included,  out-migrants  to  other 
countries also have to be taken into account. However, 
this  will  impose  data  constraints:  those  emigrating 
will lack data at the end of the period of analysis – re­
gardless of which period is chosen – and in-migrants 
coming from abroad will lack data for the start of the 
period. There might be ways of overcoming this prob­
lem by for instance using data for the start of the analy­
sis period for out-migrants, using end of period values 
for in-migrants and some kind of averaged values for 
those staying put in the selected neighbourhoods dur­
ing the period. This will evoke other problems (e.g. 
related to changing macroeconomic conditions over 
a period) and as the flight–avoidance hypotheses are 
primarily of interest in the context of intra-urban mi­
gration, the choice here is easy.

Model and data
The  subsequent  multivariate  analyses  estimate 
the  probability  of  migrating  to  particular  neigh­
bourhoods  versus  migrating  to  other  types  of 

neighbourhoods,  and  the  probability  of  migrating 
from or staying in a particular type of neighbour­
hood. In both cases the dependant variable is dichot­
omous (1/0) and the appropriate statistical approach 
is to use logistic regression. Using the moving/stay­
ing example, the general form of the logistic regres­
sion equation is:

 

ln (P/(1 – P)) = β0 + β1 X1 + β2 X2 + … + βn Xn 

(1)

where P is the probability of moving, β0 is the inter­
cept (constant) and the Xs are the independent vari­
ables. This can be rearranged to give:

  P(Move)  =  exp(β0  +  β1  X1  +  β2  X2  +  …+  βn  Xn)/(1  + 
  exp(β0 + β1 X1 + β2 X2 + … + βn Xn)) 
(2)

I use a range of independent variables (described be­
low) aiming to control for demographic, socioeco­
nomic and neighbourhood characteristics that might 
affect our primary independent variable of interest. 
In other words, I am interested in whether probabil­
ities of moving into Type 1 neighbourhoods are eth­
nically selective.
The  variables  used  are  constructed  from  data 
 
contained in the Statistics Sweden Louise/Lisa files,

for some key characteristics, by country of origin, of 
this population).
I  use  two  binary  logistic  regression  models, 
 
building them up in four stages (adding more inde­
pendent variables in each stage), for estimating the 
effect of individual attributes that could explain dif­
ferences between those moving into Type 1 neigh­
bourhoods during a three-year period (2005–2008) 
compared  with  other  movers;  and  those  leaving 
this  category  of  neighbourhoods  compared  with 
those who stay put during the period. Except for age 
(measured in 2005), and family and income change 
(measured from 2005 to 2008), all data refer to the 
situation at the end of the period (2008). Due to data 
constraints the unit of analysis is individuals, not 

households, but disposable household income and 
family  type  are  controlled  for.  For  family Type  I 
use four categories for singles and couples with and 
without children, with singles without a child as the 
reference category.
I  also  include  a  dummy  indicating  whether 
 
a person has experienced a change in family type 
from 2005 to 2008. Other mobility studies have con­
firmed the key importance of demographic events so 
I believe it will contribute to predicting at least dif­
ferences between movers and stayers but not nec­
essarily  between  different  groups  of  intra-urban 
movers. It should be pointed out that there might be 
two problems with this variable. One is that I can­
not identify whether change of family took place be­
fore, in connection to or after the move. The other is 
that it is probably the case that some demographic 
events increase the probability of moving into immi­
grant-dense neighbourhoods while others might in­
dicate another type of geographical selectivity. The 
models have experimentally been run with a range 
of separate types of family changes and – except for 
in the mover–stayer regression analysis – few more 
specific transitions are statistically significant and 
none alters the estimate of our key variable (ethnic

origin).  Including  a  general  family  change  varia­
ble is judged to provide sufficient control for demo­
graphic change in these analyses.
Ethnicity is measured by using data on coun­
 
try of birth for four types of countries: Sweden (ref­
erence category in the model), Western countries, 
Eastern Europe and non-Western countries. An in­
dicator is also included for whether a person has for­
eign background (at least one parent born abroad) 
and  information  is  added  concerning  recently  ar­
rived immigrants (immigrating after 2002, i.e. five 
years or less in Sweden in 2008). Immigration to 
Stockholm has for several decades been dominated 
by refugees (and family-related immigration) com­
ing from a vast range of Third World countries. One 
may note that there are of course internal variations 
within the four broad groups defined by their country 
of origin (see Table 7), but it is reasonable to hypoth­
esize that the flight/avoidance issue is most relevant 
in relation to visible minorities; that is, people orig­
inating in predominantly Muslim countries and in 
Africa, and that the broad category non- Western im­
migrants is justified in this particular context.
The age variable is a dummy separating those 
 
aged 25–34 from those aged 35–50 in 2005. Younger 
adults are much more mobile so including this con­
trol will make it possible to see if migration destina­
tions are also affected by this higher rate of mobility.
  Both  disposable  income  and  the  individu­
als’ work income are categorized into three groups 
(lowest three deciles, deciles 4–7, and highest three 
deciles). An  individual’s  educational  level  can  be 
low (less than 12 years of school education), me­
dium  (12–14  years)  or  high  (15+  years).  In  the 
regression  model,  high  income  and  high  educa­
tion respectively are used as reference categories. 
In order to control for upward and downward so­
cial mobility during the period, disposable income 
change from 2005 to 2008 is added in the form of 
two  dummy  variables  (lower  and  upper  quartile; 
i.e. income increased less than 14,100 SEK, which 
is equal to quartile 1 and more than 94,300 SEK in 
quartile 4 during the period; quartiles 2 and 3 be­
ing the reference category). The equations have ex­
perimentally been estimated using other indicators 
of  labour  market  related  change  (transitions  from 
employment to unemployment and vice versa), but 
none of these tests affected the point estimates for 
our key variables of interest. Finally, dummy vari­
ables are added for whether a person is employed, 
unemployed or studying and whether they have re­
ceived social allowance in 2008. Employment status 

refers to a particular week in November 2008, while 
the other three dichotomous variables are based on 
data for the full year. A single individual can there­
fore  hypothetically  experience  all  four  positions 
during the year.
 
Finally, to be able to better judge whether it is 
immigrant  density  and  not  other  neighbourhood 
characteristics that drives results, three continuous 
neighbourhood-related  covariates  are  included  in 
the last model of each regression: number of work­
ers  in  the  retail  sector  per  capita  and  neighbour­
hood, percentage aged 20–64 in the neighbourhood 
who are employed, and percentage of all individu­
als in the neighbourhood who have children. Each 
one of these can be hypothesized to affect house­
holds’ choice of staying or leaving and the destina­
tion choice for movers. Many neighbourhoods – not 
least poor and immigrant-dense ones – experience 
over time a declining level of commercial services. 
If poor service is indeed important for explaining 
migration selectivity, including data on retail would 
hopefully control for this dimension. Employment 
level is included to control for socioeconomic char­
acteristics  of  neighbourhoods.  Employment  level 
correlates strongly with other socioeconomic char­
acteristics  such  as  income  and  educational  com­
position.  Finally,  the  proportion  having  children 
in  neighbourhoods  might  influence  migration  de­
cisions  differently;  it  can  be  attractive  for  fam­
ilies with children but maybe less so for childless 
households.
There can of course be other (unmeasured) in­
 
dividual, household and neighbourhood character­
istics that theoretically could improve the estimates. 
Some of these will be discussed in the concluding 
section.

Descriptives
Table 8 reports descriptive data for the three groups 
of  migrants  and  the  Type  1  stayers  compared  in 
the two logistic regression analyses presented be­
low. The out-movers from Type 1 neighbourhoods 
aged  25–50  comprise  around  7,900  people  while 
in- movers are substantially fewer, less than 4,900. 
About 19,400 stay in the Type 1 neighbourhoods, 
while 174,000 move neighbourhood within the re­
gion but not from or to a Type 1 neighbourhood. As 
stated above, the Type 1 neighbourhoods lose popu­
lation in the intra-regional migration exchange dur­
ing this three-year period and that is true also for 
this  more  limited  age  group  (25–50).  As  for  the

compositional differences between the two catego­
ries, some obvious differences can briefly be men­
tioned:  the  youngest  age  group  (25–34)  is  more 
mobile than the older age group (35–50). While the 
25–34 year olds make up 38 per cent of the region’s 
total population aged 25–50, they comprise the ma­
jority of those entering and leaving neighbourhoods 
rapidly becoming more immigrant dense (the Type 
1 segment). Their proportion of the Type 1 stayers is 
somewhat below their relative share of the region’s 
population.  Virtually  all  analyses  on  geographi­
cal mobility show that age is of crucial importance 
(e.g. Rossi 1955; Clark and Dieleman 1996; Mulder 
2006; Kährik and Tammaru 2010) so this finding is 
of course not surprising.
  Males are more inclined than females to enter and 
leave  Type  1  neighbourhoods.  Non- Western- born 

individuals comprise only 14 per cent of the region’s 
population and 13 per cent of non-Type 1 movers 
but they make up 46 per cent of the in- movers to and 
more than a third of the out-movers from this neigh­
bourhood  segment.  Individuals  born  in  Sweden 
(some of these could of course be second- generation 
immigrants) make up 38 per cent of those entering 
but 51 per cent of those leaving the segment. Those 
having foreign background make up two-thirds of 
those entering and staying in Type 1 neighbourhoods 
but also more than half (57%) of those leaving this 
segment. It is also obvious that the most recent im­
migrants (immigrated after 2002) comprise a much 
bigger proportion of those entering (18%) compared 
with those leaving (9%) the Type 1 segment.
  Couples without a child constitute a small cat­
egory  and  their  proportion  does  not  differ  much

between  the  categories.  Couples  with  children 
comprise roughly half of the population, but only 
around  40  per  cent  of  those  entering  and  leaving 
Type  1  neighbourhoods.  Singles  without  children 
are slightly over represented among the in-movers 
to the Type 1 segment.
  As corroborated by earlier studies (Andersson 
and Bråmå 2004) there are clear employment and in­
come differences between those who enter and leave 
immigrant-dense  neighbourhoods  in  Stockholm. 
The focus here is on the most labour market active 
segment of the labour force and hence employment 
frequencies are relatively high for both categories. 
It is nevertheless a fact that employment levels for 

those leaving the segment are clearly higher than for 
in-movers (vice versa for unemployment and social 
benefits). Both work and disposable income differ­
ences are pronounced between in- and out-movers 
but both categories have more individuals with low 
and medium income and less with high income than 
the  region  as  such.  Change  in  disposable  income 
from 2005 to 2008 is on average positive for all four 
categories, but least positive for stayers in Type 1 
neighbourhoods and most positive for movers to and 
from other types of neighbourhoods (Table 8, col­
umn 4). This is also indicated by the distribution of 
the two income change dummies included: the stay­
ers in Type 1 neighbourhoods comprise 35 per cent

having  experienced  small  income  gains  (or  even 
losses) while only 13 per cent belong to the upper 
quartile in terms of disposable income change.
The issue of selective migration in relation to 
 
ethnic  residential  segregation  does  obviously  fo­
cus on selectivity across ethnic groups or catego­
ries. It is however necessary to take demographic 
and socioeconomic differences across groups into 
account (Finney and Simpson 2008). What at first 
sight might look like an ethnic selection could be 
the result of compositional differences so that the 
causal relationships get blurred. If for instance a cer­
tain selection is primarily caused by socioeconomic 
differences – differences in migration destinations 

between poor and rich individuals – and if the socio-
economic  composition  of  natives  and  immigrants 
differs,  we  might  draw  the  erroneous  conclusion 
that ethnicity is driving the selection process if we 
do not control for individuals’ socioeconomic posi­
tion. Besides differences along the class dimension, 
other  compositional  differences  are  also  common 
between natives and immigrants, such as age, gen­
der, family structure and housing tenure. In the lo­
gistic regression analysis below I control for a range 
of such potentially important factors.

region. The model is run in four steps where Model 
1 only includes controls for the country of birth var­
iable.  In  Model  2  other  demographic  information 
is  added,  Model  3  also  comprises  socioeconomic 
control variables, and Model 4 includes covariates 
for characteristics other than ethnic neighbourhood 
characteristics (retail, employment and proportion 
of individuals having children).
 
The first model shows that ethnic background 
makes a huge difference, at least when not control­
ling  for  anything  else. All  migrant  categories  but 
especially  non-Western  immigrant  movers  have 
a  significant  higher  propensity  than  native  mov­
ers  to  enter  Type  1  neighbourhoods  (odds  quota 
6.5). These differences remain significant but natu­
rally less pronounced after controlling for other de­
mographic attributes (Model 2). It is also obvious 
that the reason for the higher probability for other 
Western  immigrants  to  enter  Type  1  neighbour­
hoods is a direct effect of their demographic com­
position. When this is controlled for, they are in fact 
less inclined than natives to have such neighbour­
hoods as destination. The point estimates for ethnic 
background change somewhat when socioeconomic 
attributes are also added in Model 3 and other neigh­
bourhood characteristics in Model 4, but they re­
main  statistically  significant  for  people  born  in 
Eastern Europe and in non-Western countries. After 

controlling  for  demographic  characteristics,  edu­
cation, income and the other control variables it is 
about 50 per cent more likely to find people born in 
these regions/countries having moved into the Type 
1 segment during this period (odds quota 1.5 and 
1.6, respectively).
Ethnic background does play a role but so do 
 
many other individual attributes. The following in­
dividual characteristics speak in favour of moving 
into a Type 1 neighbourhood compared with hav­
ing another neighbourhood as destination: being age 
35–50 rather than younger, male rather than female, 
being a recent immigrant, a second-generation im­
migrant, a couple with or without child(ren), hav­
ing low or medium work income and especially low 
or medium disposable income, low or medium level 
of education, and finally to be unemployed and liv­
ing in rental housing after the move. The three last 
covariates added in Model 4 are all negatively re­
lated to migration into the Type 1 neighbourhoods. 
Moving  into  higher  retail  density,  stronger  em­
ployment  contexts  and  neighbourhoods  with  high 
family- with-children  density  means  moving  else­
where rather than into a Type 1 destination.
  Unfortunately,  the  large  number  of  point  es­
timates  produced  by  the  final  model  might  make 
the  interpretation  of  relationships  difficult. To  as­
sist in this regard, I used the statistically significant

coefficients from the fourth model to compute prob­
abilities of entering a Type 1 neighbourhood, com­
paring individuals having different combinations of 
attributes (see Fig. 2). All values are based on a com­
parison  with  an  intra-urban  migrant  who  in  2005 
was aged 35–50, and who was a Swedish-born fe­
male with high disposable income and a high level 
of education. All these attributes make it less likely 
to have moved into the Type 1 segment of neigh­
bourhoods. As can be seen, a male aged 25–34 years 
born in a non-Western country and who had a less 
strong socioeconomic position has a clearly higher 
risk of being among the Type 1 in-migrants. If such 
an individual had immigrated after 2002, had a low 
disposable income and low level of education and 
was living in rental housing, the probability is 45 
per cent higher compared with the reference person 
used in this example.
 
It should of course be noted that the final model 
explains about 14 per cent of the variation between 
the two groups of migrants. This is normal for this 
type  of  regression  analysis,  but  indicates  that  the 
model  either  lacks  important  information  or  that 
there is a great deal of randomness regarding who 
moves  into  or  out  of  neighbourhoods  becoming 
more immigrant dense. The control variables are all 
important, at least for explaining mobility as such 
(see Andersson 2012), but they are obviously less 
powerful  for  explaining  variation  in  destinations 
among  these  intra-urban  migrants.  However,  it  is 
clear that ethnic origin seems to be an important part 
of the selective migration story: adding other neigh­
bourhood characteristics do not alter the conclusion 
that natives and other Western people to a higher de­
gree than non-Western immigrants avoid (or are able 
to avoid) moving into immigrant-dense areas.
 
The next table (Table 10) reports point estimates 
for  the  same  model  applied  for  out-movers  from 
and stayers in Type 1 neighbourhoods. The findings 
are interesting, not least concerning the ethnic di­
mension. When running the full model (Model 4), 
the  only  significant  estimate  found  for  an  ethnic 
category is that – in relation to the native Swedes 
– Western immigrants are more likely to move out 
from this segment than to stay put (odds quota 1.3). 
So if there is any flight going on during this partic­
ular time period, it is not Swedes that react upon in­
creasing immigrant densities by showing a higher 
rate  of  outmigration  compared  with  immigrants. 
However, a moderation of this statement is neces­
sary: people having a foreign background (i.e. being 
second-generation immigrants) are much less likely 

to leave compared with people with a Swedish back­
ground (odds quota 0.7).
  Other individual attributes also strongly predict 
leaving this neighbourhood segment:

DD aged 25–34 rather than 35–50;
DD being  a  recent  rather  than  an  early  immigrant 
(this is most certainly due to very high overall 
mobility  for  recent  immigrants  and  their  pro­
nounced over representation in this segment);

DD being single with a child in contrast to single 

without a child;
DD being employed;
DD having high work income and high disposable 

income;

DD having high educational level;
DD studying;
DD not living in rental housing.

In terms of ethnicity, the analyses of flows into and 
out of the fast growing immigrant concentration ar­
eas can be concluded by stating that there seem to 
be strong indications of avoidance behaviour while 
I find much less support for flight tendencies. I will 
however carry out one more analysis before elabo­
rating on the results.

Comparing upward and downward movers
One  final  analysis  of  intra-regional  migration  in 
Stockholm will be presented and the focus is now on 
those either moving into higher or lower non-Nordic 
immigrant densities. I have placed each neighbour­
hood into a decile position according to the share of 
non-Nordic-born residents in 2005 and then cross-
tabulated the inhabitants’ residential decile position 
in 2005 and in 2008. Table 11 makes use of this in­
formation and displays migration flows across all 
neighbourhood decile categories for two broad cat­
egories of residents: natives and non-Nordic immi­
grants. It shows for each of the ten decile positions 
the relative share of residents who stay in the same 
decile position from 2005 to 2008, and the propor­
tion who move to less (“downward”) and to more 
(“upward”)  immigrant-dense  neighbourhoods,  re­
spectively.  There  can  of  course  be  no  downward 
moves  from  decile  1  (the  least  immigrant-dense 
type of neighbourhood) and there can be no upward 
moves from decile 10 (the most immigrant-dense 
type).  The  results  indicate  systematic  differences 
between the two broad and indeed internally hetero­
geneous groups of residents:

DD while natives have the lowest share of stayers 
in decile 10 neighbourhoods (72%), non-Nordic 
residents show the highest probability of stay­
ing in this particular neighbourhood type (85%);
DD it is much more common for immigrants com­
pared  with  natives  in  all  decile  positions  to 
move in the direction of higher immigrant den­
sity (upwards);

DD while about the same proportion of non-Nordic 
immigrants  residing  in  deciles  7–9  move  up­
wards  as  well  as  downwards,  natives  in  these 
decile positions have a substantially higher rate 
of downward migration. This pattern indicates 
both flight and avoidance.

The  analysis  proceeds  by  focusing  attention  on 
those living in deciles 7–9 at the beginning of the 
period; that is, in those neighbourhoods having rel­
atively  high  but  not  very  high  non-Nordic  immi­
grant densities (between 10.4% and 34.9%). Table 
11 indicates that about the same proportion of the 
non-Nordic  immigrants  living  in  these  segments 
moved upwards (into higher non-Nordic densities) 
and downwards while native Swedes tend to more 
clearly move downwards. Whether this ethnic dif­
ference supports an “ethnic explanation” also after 
controlling for demographic and socioeconomic in­
dividual characteristics remains to be seen.

density is less than the number moving into lower 
density. Of the 216,000 individuals aged 25–50 who 
lived in deciles 7–9 in 2005, and remained in the 
region in 2008, 19,400 moved to higher density in 
2008 while 49,400 moved downwards. Key differ­
ences between these 69,000 movers are displayed in 
Table 12.
The analysis is carried out in four model steps, 
 
but comments are confined to Model 4. The control 
variables are almost all highly statistically signifi­
cant and they are the same as for the recently pre­
sented regression analyses except for the inclusion 
of dummies, indicating the residential starting point 
for these migrants (whether they lived in a decile 

7, 8 or 9 type of neighbourhood in 2005). The lat­
ter obviously has substantial influence both before 
and after controlling for demographic and socioeco­
nomic attributes: living in a decile 7 neighbourhood 
increases the probability of moving upwards rather 
than downwards four times compared with living 
in a decile 9 neighbourhood. This is probably pri­
marily an effect of the fact that there are many more 
neighbourhoods having higher immigrant density to 
choose from if you leave a decile 7 neighbourhood 
compared with a decile 9 neighbourhood and also 
that the difference between decile 7 and 8 neigh­
bourhoods is less than between decile 9 and 10 in 
terms of immigrant density.

  Compared with those moving downwards (to­
wards less immigrant-dense neighbourhoods), those 
moving upwards tend to have the following indi­
vidual characteristics: they tend to be males rather 
than females, of Eastern European or non-Western 
origin rather than Swedish, having immigrated re­
cently or being a second-generation immigrant, hav­
ing changed family type recently and being single 
without children rather than any other family type. 
They also tend to have lower work and disposable 
income and low rather than high education, and they 
are more often unemployed, on social allowances 
and studying. To reside in a rental dwelling after the 
move is 2.4 times as probable if people move up­
wards compared with downwards, which indicates 
that tenure preferences (or rather constraints) play a 
big role in this selection. Furthermore, those ending 
up in neighbourhoods having more service jobs def­
initely move downwards. Neither of these character­
istics is counter-intuitive and one should notice that 
not only are all variables except for age and one fam­
ily  type  statistically  highly  significant,  the  model 
now  has  more  explanatory  power  compared  with 
the earlier ones; it explains about 26 per cent of the 
total variation between the two groups of migrants. 
When all the demographic, socioeconomic and the 
three neighbourhood characteristics are taken into 
account, non-Western immigrants are 2.4 times and 
Eastern European immigrants 1.8 times as likely as a 
native born Swede to move upwards compared with 
downwards.

Caveats
There can be many unmeasured individual charac­
teristics affecting migration propensity and destina­
tion, not least social networks, and also the location 
of  workplaces  in  relation  to  individuals’  educa­
tional profile and occupation. For instance, Hedman 
(2011)  shows  that  whether  intra-urban  migrants 
have  relatives  in  certain  neighbourhoods  affects 
the probability of people choosing such neighbour­
hoods  as  destinations.  This  is  but  one  proxy  for 
social networks that one could anticipate will influ­
ence destination choices. Also other neighbourhood 
characteristics not measured here surely can play a 
role (environmental issues, accessibility, etc.) but it 
is beyond the scope of this analysis to cover all pos­
sible factors that might affect destination choices. 
We will be in a better position to judge on this af­
ter having analysed the survey material collected as 
part of this research project.

Conclusions
The lion’s share of existing literature on the white 
flight–avoidance  issue  concerns  US  race-related 
conditions. This is due to the longstanding debate 
and social problems related to racial segregation and 
ghetto formation in the USA (Wilson 1987), but un­
fortunately also to a neglect in Europe to fully grasp 
the dynamics of segregation following in the wake 
of increasing social polarization in the context of 
more multicultural urban settings. As I see it, there 
has been a tendency in Europe, including Sweden, to

view ethnic and race segregation primarily as a self-
segregation process where immigrants are thought 
to prefer living in proximity to fellow countrymen 
and thus to cluster on ethnic grounds. This view has 
been increasingly criticized over the last decade or 
two (see Molina 1997; Andersson 1998; Simpson 
and Finney 2009; Phillips 2010) but this critique has 
not yet translated fully into systematic empirical re­
search where more emphasis is placed on studying 
the majority populations’ actual behaviour, includ­
ing their settlement decisions and migration. This 
article aims to contribute to this line of research.
  One should of course be aware of the risks of in­
corporating concepts that are found to be productive 
in  one  context  into  another  one.  Historical,  geo­
graphical  and  institutional  differences  are  indeed 
big if one contrasts US cities with most European, 
including Swedish, cities. However, this is no argu­
ment against why citizens would behave differently 
in  terms  of  their  strategy  to  cope  with  increasing 
ethnic  diversity,  increasing  quality  differences  in 
social and commercial services, and territorial stig­
matization. It should also be noticed that flight and 
avoidance are concepts that may also be applied on 
grounds other than ethnic grounds. One might flee 
from or avoid poor people and poor neighbourhoods, 
prostitution-  or  crime-plagued  districts,  environ­
mentally hazardous conditions and so forth (Harris 
2001). What makes the notion of white flight–avoid­
ance a more sensitive one is probably the inference 
to what might be behind such behaviour: xenopho­
bia, racism and the reluctance to accept people per­
ceived to be different.
There  are  no  grounds  for  hypothesizing  that 
 
such  sentiments  and  behaviour  are  different  in 
Europe or elsewhere compared with the USA, but 
there could of course be circumstances that either 
mitigate or reinforce such behaviour. One such cir­
cumstance is definitely the housing market as such, 
including  the  tenure  structure. As  pointed  out  by 
Goering  (1978),  renters  are  generally  more  toler­
ant to high levels of minority presence in a neigh­
bourhood,  since  they  are  not  directly  affected  by 
decreases in property values (see also Galster 2012, 
ch.  6,  analysing  the  development  of  Detroit’s  ra­
cial segregation). The proportion of rental housing 
is much bigger – albeit rapidly decreasing, not least 
in  Stockholm  (Andersson  and  Magnusson  Turner 
2011) – in Sweden compared with most other coun­
tries (especially the USA) and we might therefore 
expect that the relative presence of minority house­
holds  may  not  trigger  minority- related  flight  and 

avoidance behaviour to the same extent. However, 
this is an empirical question and this article has en­
gaged with analysing the Stockholm case using a 
very comprehensive, longitudinal dataset.
  Most of the descriptive data presented in this ar­
ticle support the white avoidance–flight hypotheses. 
The third section concluded that the increase in the 
proportion of non-Nordic residents in certain neigh­
bourhoods  seems  to  a  combined  result  of  native 
Swedes  leaving  or  avoiding  these  neighbourhoods 
for other destinations within the region, and the pro­
nounced selectivity in destination patterns for natives 
and  non-Nordic  migrants  entering  the  region  from 
abroad or from other places of origin within Sweden.
 

In the following section it was found that:

DD the results indicate systematic differences bet­

ween the two groups of residents;

DD while natives have the lowest share of stayers 
in decile 10 neighbourhoods (72%), non-Nordic 
residents show the highest probability of stay­
ing in this particular neighbourhood type (85%);
DD it is much more common for immigrants com­
pared  with  natives  in  all  decile  positions  to 
move in the direction of higher immigrant den­
sity (upwards);

DD while about the same proportion of non-Nordic 
immigrants  residing  in  deciles  7–9  move  up­
wards  as  well  as  downwards,  natives  in  these 
decile positions have a substantially higher rate 
of downward migration. This pattern indicates 
both flight and avoidance.

To get a comprehensive picture of changes in the 
distribution of the majority and ethnic minority cate­
gories across neighbourhoods in Stockholm, the im­
portance of including the migration exchange with 
the outer world (the rest of Sweden and abroad; see 
also Bråmå 2006) has to be acknowledged. However, 
for addressing the research question of whether eth­
nic  differences  in  migratory  behaviour  are  driven 
by the majority’s tendency to avoid certain types of 
neighbourhoods and move out of the very same, it is 
more appropriate to focus on intra-regional residen­
tial mobility and to conduct multivariate analyses. 
This has been done as the final stage of the analysis, 
and results were reported in the last part of the fourth 
section and in the penultimate section. After con­
trolling for a wide set of demographic and socioec­
onomic individual attributes, the following could be 
expected in terms of the composition of those enter­
ing areas rapidly becoming more immigrant dense:

in-movers  are  less  well  educated,  more  often  un­
employed, have lower disposable income, and they 
are less often natives or have a Western background 
compared with those who move elsewhere in the re­
gion and also compared with those who leave the 
segment.
 
The  final  logistic  regression  of  those  leaving 
deciles  7–9  for  destinations  that  are  more  or  less 
immigrant  dense  confirms  the  earlier  descriptive 
analyses carried out. Not only are many more peo­
ple moving “downwards” than “upwards”, there is 
a pronounced ethnic and social class selectivity in 

these migration flows. Compared with those mov­
ing  downwards  (towards  less  immigrant-dense 
neighbourhoods), those moving upwards tend to be 
males rather than females, of Eastern European or 
non-Western  origin  rather  than  Swedish,  and  sin­
gle  without  children  rather  than  any  other  family 
type. They also tend to have a lower income and low 
rather than high education, and they are more of­
ten unemployed, on social allowances and studying. 
Compared  with  non-Western  immigrants,  native- 
born Swedes are far less inclined to move up the eth­
nic hierarchy of neighbourhoods.

It can be argued that the findings reported here 
 
indicate  avoidance  of  immigrant  concentration  ar­
eas. The flight hypothesis gets less strong support 
(see also Simpson and Finney 2009 and for a con­
trasting conclusion, see Crowder et al. 2011, p. 25). I 
suggest that this is not only the result of the fact that 
residents who experience many immigrants might be 
less negative in their perceptions of immigrant- dense 
neighbourhoods; it is probably and maybe primarily 
because of mobility constraints facing most of those 
residing  in  such  neighbourhoods.  In  a  tight  hous­
ing market characterized by high and rising housing 

costs, it is only those households who manage well 
income-wise that do have a real option to “escape” 
stigmatized neighbourhoods. The results show that 
the issue of staying or leaving is not an ethnic issue. 
Those who are employed and experience fast upward 
income mobility are – irrespective of their ethnic or­
igin – clearly more prone to leave. This, in turn, also 
needs to be understood in relation to the tenure struc­
ture and to other structural features of these neigh­
bourhoods (see also Crowder et al. 2011).
 
In the next step of this project we will analyse data 
generated by a comprehensive questionnaire sent to

3,000 native-born respondents living in the Stockholm 
region. Half of these are sampled from the most im­
migrant-dense areas (both stayers in and out-movers 
from decile 10) while half will represent stayers and 
movers from other types of neighbourhoods. Taken 
together, the register-based and the survey-based data 
will hopefully give us a solid ground for drawing even 
clearer but also nuanced conclusions about the flight–
avoidance issue in the Swedish context.
