Abstract
Two formats of labeling in rating scales are commonly used in questionnaires:
verbal labels for end categories only (END form) and verbal labels for each of
the categories (ALL form). We examine attention processes and respon-
dents’ burden in using verbal labels in rating scales. Attention was tracked
in a laboratory setting employing eye-tracking technology. The results of the
two experiments are presented: One applied seven and the other applied five
categories in rating scales comparing END and ALL forms (n ¼ 47 in each
experiment). The results show that the ALL form provides higher reliability,
although the probability that respondents attend to a verbal label seems to
decrease as the number of verbally labeled categories increases.
