Today’s Agenda

Thesis Statement 

What, Where, How? 

Practice 

Accurate Use of Quotations: 

Citing Poetry and Drama

Thesis Statement

What is a thesis statement? 

it is the central idea of your paper 

it is a very speciﬁc argument that guides 
your paper 

it is based on your speciﬁc assertion(s) 
about a certain topic 

   

 

 

topic + speciﬁc assertion = thesis

Writing a Term Paper

1. Select a subject 
2. Narrow the topic 
3. “Dig deep“ into the primary text 
4. State the tentative thesis 
5. Conduct research 
6. Form a preliminary bibliography 
7. Prepare an outline 
8. Write a rough draft 
9. Edit your paper 
10. Write the ﬁnal draft

You do not need a 
perfect thesis statement 
before you draft the rest 
of the paper. 	

In fact, you might need 
to modify your thesis.

Thesis Statement - Where?

The Introduction of a paper consists of several 
parts: 

Topic paragraph 

Orientation paragraph 

Thesis paragraph 

Organization paragraph 

- here you clarify the 
question that will be 
addressed in your 
term paper 
- culmination in 
thesis statement 

Thesis Statement - Example

Thesis Statement

Thesis Statement- Example

Charles E. May: Hardy’s Darkling Thrush: The 
Nightingale Grown Old  

Theses Paragraph:  
I suggest that „Ode to a Nightingale“ was not 
merely „stirring in Hardy’s consciousness“ but 
that the parallels by their very pervasiveness 
indicate that Hardy purposely took Keat’s 
romantic view of nature and inverted it to write 
an ironic rejection of such a view.

The Thesis Statement

is a statement (not a question!) 

should be interesting and challenging and should 
create expectations  

should be debatable  

should imply the discussion that is to follow 

it should not pre-empt it and should not give away 
the conclusion 

A Weak Thesis Statement

is vague: it does not specify an argument 

offers plot summary, statement of fact, or obvious 
truths instead of an argument 

!!

offers opinion or conjecture rather than an argument 
(cannot be proven with textual evidence) 

is too broad or too complex for the length of the paper 
uses meaningful-sounding words but does not say 
anything

A Weak Thesis Statement

Examples 

In Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s 
Stone Harry becomes a wizard and 
engages in his ﬁrst battle with Voldemort. 

 I think that the friendship between Ron 
and Harry is one of the most important in 
the Harry Potter books.

A Strong Thesis Statement

answers a speciﬁc question 

takes a distinct position on the topic 

is debatable (a reasonable person could argue an 
alternative position) 

is appropriately focused for the page length of the 
assignment 

allows your reader to anticipate the organization of 
your argument

Thesis Statement - Practice

Task: 

Read the introductions and discuss with a partner: 

Do they offer a clear thesis statement? 

Do you know what the paper will be about? 

What are your expectations? 

What could be improved?

Thesis Statement - Example

Title of the paper:  
   
   

Immigrant Women in Western Societies    

 
  as Presented in “A Pair of Jeans” 

 

Thesis 

I argue that the different perspectives in “A Pair of 
Jeans“ cannot only be considered as a rhetorical 
device to present the plot in a more interesting way, 
but they rather draw the reader’s attention to the 
depth and diversity of the female characters’ different 
conﬂicts.

Thesis Statement - Practice

Task: Form groups of four 

Try generating a thesis on An Ideal Husband by Oscar 
Wilde 

Concentrate on one level you have already talked 
about in the Study Skills Course: 

character, genre, form, action, setting 

What further research would you have to do? 

Two of your group should present your thesis to the 
class! (It should be properly worded!)

Accurate Use of 

Quotations

Quoting Drama and Poetry

Quoting Drama

If you quote a dialog by two or more characters in a 
play:	


set the quotation off from your text 

write the characters’ names in capital letters and 
put a period behind them 

indent the subsequent lines of a character’s speech 
an additional quarter inch	


stage directions are treated like other quoted text

Quoting Drama

For example: 
!

OBERON. Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania. 
TITANIA. What, jealous Oberon! Fairies, skip hence: 
I have forsworn his bed and company. 

 OBERON. Tarry, rash wanton: am not I thy lord? 





(A Midsummer Night‘s Dream, 2, 1, 46-49)

Quoting Poetry

If you quote parts or all of a single line of verse 
→ put it in quotation marks within your text 

If you want to incorporate two or three lines, 
use a slash ( / ) with a space on each side to 
separate them	


If you quote more than three lines, begin a 
new line, indent your text and put no 
quotation marks

Quoting Poetry

For example: 

!

Elizabeth Bishop’s “In the Waiting Room” is 
rich in evocative detail:	


	


 
 
 

	


	


It was winter. It got dark 
  early. The waiting room 
  was full of grown-up people, 
  arctics and overcoats,	


	


lamps and magazines. (6-10)
