Exercise 1

A: presupposition For sentence (i) to be true, Steven has to know some-
thing that is correct. Therefore, we need to presuppose sentence (ii). Correct
sentences including knowing always presuppose truth.

B: none This statement could not be seen as an implicature, due to the
fact that even if the information that IBM builds telephones were true, what
Maude believes (not knows!) is never objective.

C: presupposition The term proved implies logical derivability, there-
fore (ii) is to be presupposed for (i) to make sense.

D: implicature did not tell many would also include did not tell any
which would contradict (ii). Still our understanding of not many yields some.

E: presupposition Again, (ii) is necessary for (i) to make sense. If there
were no re inspector in our town, it would be impossible to talk to him.

F: implicature The logical interpretation of some yields at least one.
Therefore all would also be a correct interpretation, still if we want to
express all, we would use it as term. Therefore, our understanding gives us
the correct solution.

Excercise 2

1) Usually on Fridays I sing in the choir [implicature: also next Friday] but
this Friday I won't [implicature defeated].

2) There are ten people in our PoM seminar [implicature: there are no
more than ten people in our seminar], in fact there are even eleven people
including the prof [implicature defeated].

3) She won't necessarily get the job [impliciture: she won't get it] but she
possibly gets it [implicature defeated].
