Abstract
Listeria monocytogenes is an intracellular bacterial pathogen that pro-
motes its internalization within nonprofessional phagocytes by interact-
ing with speciﬁc host cell receptors. L. monocytogenes resides transiently
in a membrane-bound compartment before escaping into the host cell
cytosol where bacterial proliferation takes place. Actin-based motil-
ity then promotes cell-to-cell pathogen spread. Extensive studies on
cytoskeleton rearrangements, membrane trafﬁcking, and other events
have established this microorganism as an archetype of cellular func-
tion subversion for intracellular parasitism. Here we discuss the most
signiﬁcant membrane trafﬁcking pathways hijacked by L. monocytogenes
during the host cell infection process and compare them to those of
other intracellular pathogens, in particular Shigella ﬂexneri, Salmonella
enterica, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

INTRODUCTION
Invasin of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis was the ﬁrst
reported bacterial gene product involved in the
invasion of host eukaryotic target cells (Isberg
et al. 1987), which opened the door to a new
ﬁeld that emerged at the boundaries of classical
cell biology and microbiology: cellular micro-
biology. During the same period, the hemolysin
gene of Listeria monocytogenes was characterized
and became not only the ﬁrst L. monocytogenes
virulence factor to have its gene characterized
but also the ﬁrst bacterial gene product for
which a function critical to bacterial survival
within host cells was attributed (Mengaud et al.
1987). Since then, the molecular adaptations
of L. monocytogenes to the eukaryotic host cell
environment have been studied extensively
(Figure 1), leading to the identiﬁcation of a
broad range of new bacterial virulence factors
that, similar to the Arp2/3-dependent actin-
polymerizing ActA product or the InlB invasion
protein, have paved the road toward profound
discoveries in the areas of cell and developmen-
tal biology. Many other bacterial pathogens

have evolved fascinating adaptations to interact
with and hijack host cell functions, and in the
following sections we compare their molecular
strategies with those of L. monocytogenes with
the goal of drawing common themes in mem-
brane trafﬁcking subversion and intracellular
lifestyle.

ENTRY INTO TARGET CELLS

Subversion of Host Cell Receptors
for Pathogen Internalization
With the analysis of
the L. monocytogenes
genome, it was highlighted that this pathogen
possesses an important arsenal of surface pro-
teins that modulate bacterial interactions with
the environment, in particular with host eu-
karyotic cells (Bierne & Cossart 2007). Among
these bacterial surface molecules, the inter-
nalin family is characterized by the presence
of amino-terminal leucine-rich repeat modules
implicated in protein-protein interactions. Two
members of this family are critical for the inter-
nalization of L. monocytogenes within nonprofes-
sional phagocytic cells through interaction with
cell-speciﬁc receptors (Bierne et al. 2007).

The prototype internalin (also known as
InlA) is a cell wall covalently anchored protein,
which binds the cellular adhesion molecule E-
cadherin and induces bacterial entry into polar-
ized human epithelial cells (Gaillard et al. 1991,
Mengaud et al. 1996) (Figure 2). E-cadherin
is normally involved in homophilic interac-
tions for the establishment and maintenance
of cell-to-cell contacts in epithelial tissues, and
L. monocytogenes exploits the E-cadherin local-
ization at the intestinal barrier to invade en-
terocytes during the initial stages of host col-
onization (Lecuit et al. 2001). E-cadherin is
also involved in the bacterial invasion of the
syncitio-trophoblast layer at later placental in-
fection stages (Disson et al. 2008). Through
studies in human epithelial cell lines, it has
been shown that, during host cell invasion,
L. monocytogenes hijacks the molecular machin-
ery associated with the cytoplasmic tail of
E-cadherin. β- and α-catenins, which are
