ANGELUS NOVUS: THE ANGEL OF HISTORY

• “A Klee painting named ‘Angelus Novus’ shows an angel 
looking  as  though  he  is  about  to  move  away  from 
something  he  is  ﬁxedly  contemplating.  His  eyes  are 
staring,  his  mouth  is  open,  his  wings  are  spread. This  is 
how one pictures the angel of history. His face is turned 
toward the past. Where we perceive a chain of events, he 
sees one single catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage 
and hurls it in front of his feet. The angel would like to 
stay, awaken the dead, and make whole what has been 
smashed. But a storm is blowing in from Paradise; it has 
got  caught  in  his  wings  with  such  a  violence  that  the 
angel  can  no  longer  close  them. The  storm  irresistibly 
propels him into the future to which his back is turned, 
while the pile of debris before him grows skyward. This 
storm is what we call progress.”

• From Walter Benjamin, “On the Concept of History”
