Abstract Mindfulness has been hypothesized to directly facilitate well-being, and to
indirectly do so by enhancing self-regulated functioning. No prior research has examined
these relationships in the domain of academic achievement. The current study tested
relationships among mindfulness, achievement-related self-regulation (e.g., delay-of-
gratiﬁcation, help-seeking, and self-control) and achievement emotions among a sample of
290 undergraduate students. Results revealed that indices of mindfulness, achievement-
related self-regulation, and achievement emotions were signiﬁcantly inter-correlated. And,
results supported the hypothesis that the prediction of achievement emotions by mind-
fulness was mediated by greater self-regulation over achievement. Results are considered
in light of recent evidence for associations among mindfulness, self-regulation, and well-
being in other domains of functioning; with respect to theoretical and practical implica-
tions; and with respect to the possible fruitfulness of research bridging self-regulation as a
character strength and achievement-related functioning.
Keywords Mindfulness  Achievement  Self-regulation  Emotions  Well-being

Self-regulated learning is associated with greater academic performance (e.g., Zimmerman
2008), but also with a host of additional adaptive outcomes, including well-being (Howell
2009). As deﬁned by Pintrich (2000), self-regulated learning refers to the ‘‘active, con-
structive process whereby learners set goals for their learning and then attempt to monitor,
regulate, and control their cognition, motivation, and behaviour, guided and constrained by
their goals and the contextual features in the environment’’ (p. 453). Achievement-related
variables related to goal adoption (e.g., implicit theories of ability, achievement goal
orientations) as well as variables related to the extent to which goals are effectively
pursued and attained (e.g., help-seeking, delay-of-gratiﬁcation; learning strategies usage;
self-control; and procrastination) form a portion of the nomological network of self-reg-
ulated learning (Zeidner et al. 2000; Zimmerman 2008).

1 Self-Regulated Learning and Achievement Functioning

With respect to implicit theories of ability, incremental beliefs (i.e., viewing ability as
malleable and open to learning and development; Dweck 1999) are associated to a greater
extent than are entity beliefs (i.e., viewing ability as ﬁxed and stable) with adaptive
cognitive and behavioural consequences for students, such as greater persistence when
confronted with adversity (Dweck and Leggett 1988). Adaptive consequences are also
associated with students’ endorsement of approach forms of achievement goal orientation,
especially in the form of mastery-approach goals (Moller and Elliot 2006). Students’
academic help-seeking, which involves the willingness to seek a minimal amount of
assistance in order to achieve independently (Karabenick and Knapp 1991), is associated
with high achievement striving and self-esteem (Karabenick and Knapp 1991). Academic
delay-of-gratiﬁcation, or students’ foregoing of currently available sources of reward in
favour of the pursuit of longer-term academic goals (Bembenutty and Karabanick 2004), is
related to both the expectancy and value of delayed outcomes, suggesting its adaptive
advantage (Bembenutty 2009). Students’ use of learning strategies, such as cognitive (e.g.,
rehearsal and elaboration) and meta-cognitive (e.g., planning and regulating) strategies
(Pintrich et al. 1993), is associated with greater achievement (e.g., Pressley et al. 1987).
Self-control among students, which involves optimizing one’s ﬁt with the external world
(Tangney et al. 2004), correlates positively with adaptive personality traits, secure
attachment, perspective taking, and academic performance (Tangney et al.). Finally, stu-
dents’ procrastination, or the tendency to delay initiation or completion of important tasks
to the point of discomfort (Solomon and Rothblum 1984), is commonly conceptualized as
involving a failure of self-regulation and is associated with negative outcomes such as
lower achievement (e.g., Steel 2007).

As a further index of their adaptability,

these achievement-related self-regulatory
behaviours are associated with indices of well-being. For example, Howell (2009) showed,
among a large group of undergraduate students, that implicit theories, goal orientations,
procrastination, and self-control were reliably associated with emotional, psychological,
and social well-being. Speciﬁcally, greater well-being was associated with endorsement of
an incremental (as opposed to entity) theory of ability and a mastery-approach goal ori-
entation (as opposed to the three remaining goal orientations), and with a high degree of
self-control and low propensity to procrastinate.

2 Mindfulness and Achievement Functioning

If achievement-related self-regulation is adaptive, what factors might promote its occur-
rence? It is possible that mindfulness is associated with a greater degree of achievement-
related self-regulation. Mindfulness, as deﬁned by Brown and Ryan (2003), is ‘‘being
attentive to and aware of what is taking place in the present’’ (p. 822). Characteristics of
mindfulness include a pre-conceptual awareness and acceptance of experiences; ﬂexible
regulation of attention; an objective receptivity to experience; and an orientation to the
here-and-now (Brown et al. 2007). Mindfulness is conceptualized as promoting high levels
of well-being; speciﬁcally, mindfulness may directly foster well-being by providing
additional fullness and richness to experience, and mindfulness may indirectly enhance
well-being by facilitating healthy self-regulatory behaviour,
including an enhanced
attentiveness to one’s goals and an enhanced capacity to act in accordance with them
(Brown and Ryan 2003; Brown et al. 2007; Shapiro and Schwartz 1999, 2000). It is

123

Mindfulness and Achievement

1009

possible that, among students, mindfulness is associated with enhanced self-regulation in
the academic domain, such as greater endorsement of adaptive goals and greater control
over behaviours conducive to goal attainment. Moreover, such successful self-regulation
may, in turn, be associated with positive affective experience in the achievement domain.
Despite a recent hyperbolic increase in research on mindfulness (Brown et al. 2007),
mindfulness in the academic context has received limited attention. The cultivation of
mindfulness among undergraduate students has been shown to facilitate well-being
(Shapiro et al. 2008), and a mindfulness training program instituted with elementary stu-
dents has been shown to improve attention (Napoli et al. 2005). Also pertinent
to
achievement-related functioning, Jha et al. (2010) showed that inductions of mindfulness
can facilitate working memory capacity. And, Caldwell et al. (2010) showed that changes
in mindfulness among students involved in mindfulness-related programs was associated
with boosted self-regulatory capacity. More broadly, Hyland (2009) has recently argued in
favour of a role for enhancing mindfulness in education: ‘‘In helping us to let go of the
often mindless and restless striving that lies at the heart of our mental processes and habit-
driven behaviour, mindfulness prepares the way for genuinely rich and deep learning …’’
(p. 130). Similarly, Shapiro et al. (2010) established the case for instilling greater mind-
fulness among students in order to facilitate their personal and academic functioning.

In addition to programs aimed at cultivating a state of mindfulness in students in order
to enhance performance or other outcomes, mindfulness can also be conceptualized as a
trait (Brown and Ryan 2003) which may be related to processes and outcomes discernible
among learners. Only three studies have examined mindfulness as a disposition related to
learning-speciﬁc outcomes or processes: Shao and Skarlicki (2009) showed that mind-
fulness predicted grade point average among female (but not male) MBA students; Evans
et al. (2009) demonstrated that mindfulness predicted increased persistence on a problem-
solving task; and Radel et al. (2009) showed that mindfulness was associated with reduced
susceptibility to non-conscious priming of intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation. More
generally, Brown and Ryan (2003) demonstrated correlates of dispositional mindfulness
which may be conducive to superior academic achievement, including greater congruence
between explicit and implicit values. And, Brown et al. (2007) described correlates of
mindfulness related to achievement functioning including attentional control, goal striving,
and self-control.

3 The Current Research

No study to date has systematically examined individual differences in mindfulness in
relation to a broad range of achievement-related self-regulatory capacities and to
achievement-related emotions. This is an important gap to address for both theoretical and
practical reasons. Theoretically, extending this line of research into the academic domain
helps to determine whether relations established between mindfulness, self-regulation, and
emotional well-being generalize across domains of functioning. Moreover, achievement
functioning provides an additional domain in which to test the model wherein self-regu-
lation mediates the association between mindfulness and well-being (Brown and Ryan
2003; Brown et al. 2007; Shapiro and Schwartz 1999, 2000). Practically, interventions
aimed at cultivating mindfulness among students should be predicated on empirical ﬁnd-
ings which establish that mindfulness covaries with achievement-related capacities,
including ﬁndings which emanate from studies of trait mindfulness in convergence with
those manipulating mindfulness as a state. In the current study, we examined several

123

1010

hypotheses concerning dispositional mindfulness, achievement-related self-regulated
functioning, and achievement emotions. First, we hypothesized that greater mindfulness
would be associated with indices of achievement-related self-regulation (i.e., greater
endorsement of incremental implicit theories and of mastery-approach achievement goals;
greater willingness to seek help, to delay gratiﬁcation, and to use learning strategies;
enhanced self-control; and lower procrastination). Second, we hypothesized that mind-
fulness would be associated with positive achievement-related emotional experience.
Third, we hypothesized that achievement-related self-regulation would be associated with
positive achievement-related emotional experience. Finally, in accordance with concep-
tualizations of mindfulness by Brown and Shapiro and their colleagues (Brown and Ryan
2003; Brown et al. 2007; Shapiro and Schwartz 1999, 2000), we hypothesized that the
relationship between mindfulness and achievement emotions would be, at least in part,
mediated by achievement-related self-regulation.

4 Method

4.1 Participants

Participants were 290 introductory psychology students at a Canadian university. Females
comprised 75% of the sample, and 88% of participants identiﬁed Canada as their country of
birth. The average age of participants was 21.27 (SD = 5.15), and 90% were aged 26 or
younger. First- and second-year students comprised 78 and 16% of the sample, respectively.

4.2 Measures

4.2.1 Mindfulness

The Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (Brown and Ryan 2003) employs 15 items to
assess the extent to which an individual is aware of and attends to current experiences.
Participants rate statements describing mindless experiences, such as ‘‘I ﬁnd myself doing
things without paying attention’’, using a rating scale with endpoints labeled 1 (almost
always) and 6 (almost never). An overall score is derived by summing across the items,
with higher scores denoting greater mindfulness. Brown and Ryan established the internal
consistency of the measure (a = 0.82), its test–retest reliability (r = 0.81), and its con-
vergent validity with related measures (e.g., positive correlations with well-being).

4.2.2 Implicit Theories

The Implicit Theory of Intelligence Scale (Yates and Abd-El-Farrah 2007) is a 14-item
scale, with seven items worded to describe an incremental theory and seven worded to
reﬂect an entity theory. Items are rated on a 4-point scale with endpoints labeled 1
(strongly disagree) and 4 (strongly agree). Yates and Abd-Al-Fattah evidenced good
internal consistency for the incremental (a = 0.75) and entity subscales (a = 0.83), and
provided evidence of an invariant factor structure (i.e., two negatively correlated factors)
across two disparate samples. We created a single implicit theory score by summing across
all
items after appropriate reverse-scoring, such that higher scores denote greater
endorsement of an incremental theory of ability.

4.2.3 Achievement Goals

1011

The Achievement Goal Questionnaire (Elliot and McGregor 2001) is comprised of 12
items, with three items composing each of the four achievement goal orientations. Items
are rated on scales ranging from 1 (not at all true of me) to 7 (very true of me). Elliot and
McGregor (2001) reported evidence attesting to the reliability of the mastery-approach
(a = 0.87), mastery-avoidance (a = 0.89), performance-approach (a = 0.92) and perfor-
mance-avoidance (a = 0.83) scales. We calculated a single achievement goal index by
subtracting the average of the performance-approach, performance-avoidance, and mas-
tery-avoidance scale scores from the mastery-approach scale score, such that higher scores
indicate a greater endorsement of the mastery-approach goal orientation.

4.2.4 Academic Help-Seeking

The Academic Help-Seeking Test (Karabenick and Knapp 1991) comprises six items
describing reluctance to seek assistance on academic tasks. Items are rated on a scale with
endpoints 1 (not at all) and 5 (very much). The scale has adequate internal consistency
(a = 0.74; Karabenick and Knapp 1991). A total score was determined by summing across
all (reverse-scored) items, such that higher scores reﬂect a greater willingness to seek help.

4.2.5 Academic Delay-of-Gratiﬁcation

We employed the 10-item Academic Delay-of-Gratiﬁcation Scale (Bembenutty and Kar-
abanick 1998). Each item presents two scenarios, one of which involves delaying grati-
ﬁcation, and participants rate their choice on a 4-point scale with endpoints 1 (deﬁnitely
choose A) and 4 (deﬁnitely choose B). The scale has adequate internal consistency
(a = 0.77; Bembenutty and Karabanick 1998). Total scores were generated by summing
across all items, with appropriate reverse-scoring, such that higher scores denote greater
delay of gratiﬁcation.

4.2.6 Learning Strategies

Cognitive and meta-cognitive strategies were assessed with items adapted by Wolters
(2003) from the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (Pintrich et al. 1993).
Fifteen items assessed use of cognitive strategies such as rehearsal, elaboration, and
organization and 14 items assessed use of meta-cognitive strategies such as planning,
monitoring, and regulating. Items are rated on scales with endpoints 1 (strongly disagree)
and 7 (strongly agree). Wolters (2003) reported evidence of the internal consistency of
these scale scores (a = 0.83 and 0.90 for cognitive and meta-cognitive strategies,
respectively). We created a single index of learning strategies usage by summing across all
items, with higher scores denoting greater learning strategies utilization.

4.2.7 Self-Control

The Self-Control measure of Tangney et al. (2004) is composed of 36 items rated on a
scale ranging from 1 (not at all like me) to 5 (like me very much). Total scores are
calculated by summing across the items after reverse-scoring items worded to reﬂect
impulsivity. Tangney et al. (2004) reported high internal consistency (a = 0.89) and test–
retest reliability (r = 0.89). Validity of the scale is evidenced by inverse correlations

123

1012

A. J. Howell, K. Buro

between total scale scores and indices of maladjustment such as aggression (Tangney et al.
2004).

4.2.8 Procrastination

The 16-item Procrastination Scale (Tuckman 1991) measures the tendency to delay task
initiation or completion, as well as tendencies toward indecisiveness and poor time
management in the completion of tasks. Items are rated on 4-point scales with endpoints
labeled 1 (that’s me for sure) and 4 (that’s not me for sure). In producing total scores, the
rating scale was reversed prior to summing across the 16 items, so that higher scores
indicated greater procrastination. Tuckman (1991) demonstrated the internal consistency of
the Procrastination Scale (a = 0.90).

4.2.9 Achievement Emotions

The learning-related emotion scales of the Achievement Emotions Questionnaire (Pekrun
et al. 2002, 2005) comprise 75 items concerning positive (enjoyment, hope, and pride) and
negative (anger, anxiety, shame, and hopelessness) emotions typically experienced before,
during, and after studying. Pekrun et al. (2005) reported adequate internal consistency in
the assessment of the seven distinct emotions (a’s ranged from 0.75 to 0.92). Given a
signiﬁcant inverse correlation between overall ratings of positive and negative achieve-
ment emotions (r = -0.53), we created a single achievement emotion index reﬂecting the
difference between positive and negative emotions by subtracting the sum of the ratings of
negative emotions from the sum of the ratings of positive emotions (e.g., Golub et al. 2009;
Oishi et al. 2007).

4.3 Procedure

Data were collected on-line from consenting students enrolled in introductory psychology
courses using software called Survey Methods. Participants also reported their age and sex,
their year of study, and whether they were born inside or outside of Canada.

5 Results

Descriptive statistics are reported in Table 1. In all cases, reliability coefﬁcients are
acceptable. Table 2 shows the zero-order correlations among mindfulness, achievement-
related self-regulation variables, and achievement emotions. We set the familywise a at
0.05 by employing a testwise alpha of 0.002 (i.e., 0.05 divided by 36 pairwise correlation
coefﬁcients). Three patterns are discernible: First, the achievement-related self-regulation
variables are signiﬁcantly inter-related. Second, mindfulness is signiﬁcantly associated
with the majority of achievement-related self-regulation variables and with achievement
emotions, supporting the ﬁrst and second of our hypotheses,
respectively. Third,
achievement-related self-regulation variables are, in every instance, meaningfully related
to achievement emotions, supporting the third of our hypotheses.

Our fourth hypothesis concerned whether the association between mindfulness and
achievement emotions is mediated by achievement-related self-regulation. We used Amos
Version 18.0 to ﬁt a structural equation model (SEM). The conﬁrmatory factor analysis for

related self-regulation, and the difference score for achievement emotions showed an
acceptable ﬁt, with v2(41) = 77.80, CFI = 0.937, RMSEA = 0.074, and SRMR = 0.0808
(The signiﬁcant v2 statistic suggests a poor model ﬁt, but this test is highly sensitive to
large sample sizes such that it is relatively uncommon in large-N psychological research to
ﬁnd a non-signiﬁcant test value; McDonald and Ho 2002). Introducing paths revealed the
standardized path coefﬁcients shown in Fig. 1, where achievement emotions were
explained through mindfulness and achievement-related self-regulation scores. As shown
in Table 3, paths from mindfulness to achievement-related self-regulation and from
achievement-related self-regulation to achievement emotions were signiﬁcant, but the path
between mindfulness and achievement emotions was not. Results are based on two-sided
bias-corrected 95% conﬁdence intervals based on 2000 bootstrap samples. Overall, the
model explained 60% of variation in achievement-related emotions and 18% of variation in
achievement-related self-regulation.

To more deﬁnitively explore mediation of the association between mindfulness and
achievement emotions by achievement-related self-regulation, we applied the procedure
suggested by MacKinnon et al. (2007). First, a conﬁdence interval for the standardized
direct effect of mindfulness on achievement-related emotions is given by [0.156, 0.448],

6 Discussion

A. J. Howell, K. Buro

Our research tested four hypotheses concerning associations among dispositional mind-
fulness, achievement-related self-regulation, and achievement emotions, each of which
received support: First, mindfulness was positively associated with indices of achieve-
ment-related self-regulation, revealing that students whose state of consciousness is
present-focused and openly receptive are more likely to adopt an incremental theory of
ability and mastery-approach goal orientation, are more prone to engage in academic
help-seeking and delay-of-gratiﬁcation, and evidence greater self-control and lesser
procrastination. Mindfulness may indeed be conducive to a clear contemplation of one’s
achievement goals and of steps that can be taken to achieve them. That mindfulness was
a signiﬁcant correlate of achievement-related self-regulation is in keeping with recent
investigations of the relationship between dispositional mindfulness and achievement-
related processes (Brown and Ryan 2003; Evans et al. 2009; Radel et al. 2009; Shao and
Skarlicki 2009), with research manipulating mindfulness and demonstrating beneﬁcial
effects on student functioning (Jha et al. 2010; Napoli et al. 2005; Shapiro et al. 2008),
and with theoretical arguments for such associations (e.g., arguments that mindfulness
‘‘facilitates the control of behaviour in the service of adaptive ends’’, Brown et al. 2007,
p. 223).

Second, mindfulness was associated with achievement emotions, such that higher
mindfulness was predictive of a more favourable balance of positive to negative
emotions. This pattern is in keeping with ﬁndings from Brown and Ryan (2003), who
showed that dispositional mindfulness is correlated with positively-valenced emotional
experience. And, this ﬁnding is in keeping with studies in which individuals randomly
assigned to practice mindfulness meditation have experienced boosts in well-being (e.g.,
Shapiro et al. 2008). Third, self-regulation in the achievement domain was associated
with a more favourable balance of positive to negative emotions, consistent with
past research associating various indicators of academic self-regulation with well-being
(e.g., Howell 2009; Kaplan and Maehr 1999; Tuominen-Soini et al. 2008) and with
more ﬁne-grained ﬁndings concerning speciﬁc aspects of achievement-related self-reg-
ulation and speciﬁc achievement emotions (Daniels et al. 2009; Pekrun et al. 2006,
2009).

Fourth, despite the signiﬁcant zero-order association between mindfulness and
achievement emotions, mediation analysis indicated that the prediction of achievement
emotions by mindfulness was fully mediated by achievement-related self-regulation. In the
academic domain, it appears that mindfulness is an indirect predictor of achievement
emotions via its relationship with achievement-related self-regulation. It is interesting that
no direct route between mindfulness and achievement-related emotions emerged when
achievement-related self-regulation was taken into account. The hypothesized direct route
between mindfulness and general emotional functioning is one in which mindfulness is
seen as enriching the sensory experience of ongoing events, enhancing the impact of such
events and creating higher well-being (Brown and Ryan 2003; Brown et al. 2007). In
contrast, the measure of emotional functioning employed in the current work was speciﬁc
to achievement-related emotions;
the experiences being
mindfully attended to are less amenable to sensory enhancement compared to activities
such as eating a raisin or watching a sunset, and may therefore be less likely to directly
relate to achievement-related emotions once self-regulation in the achievement domain is
taken into account.

6.1 Mindfulness, Self-Regulation, and Well-Being

The indirect association between mindfulness and achievement emotions via achievement-
related self-regulation is congenial with theorizing which posits that mindfulness facilitates
self-regulation of behaviour and thereby promotes well-being (Brown and Ryan 2003;
Brown et al. 2007; Shapiro and Schwartz 1999, 2000). Recent research in other domains
also supports this model: Howell et al. (2010) showed that mindfulness is associated with
self-regulation in the sleep domain (e.g.,
improved sleep hygiene, reduced daytime
sleepiness, reduced dysfunctional sleep-related beliefs), which in turn is associated with
higher emotional, psychological, and social well-being (see also Howell et al. 2008). The
path analytic ﬁndings of Howell et al. (2010) also revealed a direct association between
mindfulness and well-being; here, it is notable that Howell et al. (2010) assessed well-
being broadly (i.e., they did not employ a sleep-speciﬁc measure of well-being) in contrast
to the narrower and domain-speciﬁc assessment of emotional experience in the current
study. Also, Howell et al. (2010) employed a comprehensive measure of well-being in
contrast to the assessment of only emotional aspects of well-being in the current study.
Overall, the model positing that self-regulation signiﬁcantly mediates the association
between mindfulness and well-being generalizes across different domains of functioning.
Furthermore, when mindfulness is simultaneously examined as a predictor of self-regu-
lation and of well-being, mindfulness may directly predict well-being only when a gen-
eralized measure of well-being is employed, such that it is possible to detect the general
relationship between mindfulness and the maximization of ongoing sensory experience
conducive to well-being. The indirect association between mindfulness and well-being via
domain-speciﬁc self-regulation is perhaps a robustly demonstrable effect because any
successful self-regulation associated with heightened mindfulness may be compatible with
either domain-speciﬁc or domain-general aspects of well-being.

What might be the mechanism by which mindfulness is associated with achievement-
related self-regulation and adaptive emotional experience? Evidence for boosted working
memory capacity (Jha et al. 2010), self-control (Caldwell et al. 2010), and attentional
control (Napoli et al. 2005) following the cultivation of mindfulness suggests that exec-
utive processes may be involved. Indeed, Philippot and Segal (2009) recently argued that
mindfulness invokes executive processes conducive to emotion regulation, such that
maladaptive cognitive rumination and maladaptive behavioural avoidance are less likely to
occur among mindful individuals. Executive processes include enhanced attentional con-
trol, allowing greater voluntary engagement of attention, greater sustained attention, and
greater freedom from distraction (Philippot and Segal 2009). Bolstered executive functions
such as enhanced attentional control may underlie our ﬁndings of associations among
mindfulness and achievement-related strategies such as willingness to delay gratiﬁcation or
adoption of mastery-oriented learning goals. That is, to the extent that these cognitive and
behavioural strategies beneﬁt from executive functions such as attentional control, the
cultivation of state or trait mindfulness may be conducive to superior achievement func-
tioning. For example, Heeren et al. (2009) showed that mindfulness training improved
cognitive ﬂexibility, cognitive control, and memory functioning (e.g., increased memory
speciﬁcity). Our current ﬁndings may,
import for
learners; speciﬁcally, should these ﬁndings be shown to converge with additional experi-
mental work involving manipulations of mindfulness, they suggest that students (including
perhaps those who are struggling with such difﬁculties as procrastination or poor delay-of-
gratiﬁcation) should be seeking to enhance their mindfulness in order to improve their
academic performance and experience (Hyland 2009; Shapiro et al. 2010).

6.2 Limitations and Future Directions

It is important to emphasize that the current cross-sectional study precludes drawing cause-
effect inferences concerning associations between mindfulness, achievement-related self-
regulation, and achievement emotions. While results of the mediation analysis were
congenial with the theoretical framework which guided the research, and while a lack of
signiﬁcant relationships would have falsiﬁed our predictions based upon that framework,
the current ﬁndings do not allow for the falsiﬁcation of other accounts of the relationship
among these variables. It is possible, for example, that positive achievement emotions
promote healthy achievement-related self-regulation and mindfulness. Additional research
tracking these variables over time, or manipulating mindfulness as an antecedent to self-
regulation and well-being are required to rule-out competing conceptualizations of inter-
relationships among mindfulness, self-regulation, and well-being.

Several additional limitations characterized the current study. Our sample was limited to
primarily ﬁrst year undergraduates enrolled in introductory psychology courses at a North
American university, leaving uncertain the extent to which ﬁndings generalize to other
student groups, such as older students, students in faculties other than Arts and Science,
and students from different cultural backgrounds. It would be valuable to examine such
generalizability in future research. With further respect to generalizability, we examined
several markers of achievement-related self-regulation, but we acknowledge that other
researchers may prefer other indices of such self-regulatory capacity, including measures
of actual academic performance. And, alternative operationalizations of mindfulness and
of achievement emotions could viably be included in tests of the model posited herein. For
example, the particular measure of mindfulness we adopted (i.e., the Mindful Attention
Awareness Scale) focuses primarily upon the awareness facet of mindfulness (Brown and
Ryan 2003). Adopting alternative operationalizations of mindfulness, such as a two-fold
view emphasizing awareness and acceptance (Bishop et al. 2004; Cardaciotto et al. 2008)
or a ﬁve-fold view (Baer et al. 2006), would afford the opportunity to examine whether
separable facets of mindfulness relate differently to achievement-related self-regulation
and achievement-related emotions. A further limitation is the modest size of effects in the
current study, which we interpret as reﬂecting the multiply-determined nature of self-
regulatory or emotional functioning. The reliance on self-report measures means that
common method variance is aligned in favour of the hypotheses being tested; the rela-
tionships examined in the current work could be tested further with non-self-report mea-
sures, such as the use of experience sampling as a measure of emotional well-being. The
reliance on self-report measures also means that any bias toward socially desirable
responding may have inﬂated the associations among mindfulness, self-regulation, and
achievement emotions. Here, we note that research testing relations among these variables
in other domains has demonstrated that socially desirable responding is not the reason for
positive associations among mindfulness, self-regulation, and well-being (Howell et al.
2010). Finally, although it is possible that overlap among the measurement of constructs
(e.g., concerning achievement-related self-regulation and achievement-related emotions)
contributed to signiﬁcant relations among them, we note here that explicit reference to
affective states typically did not occur among the non-emotion measures, and that relations
with achievement emotions were consistent across achievement-related self-regulation
measures including those largely devoid of emotion-related content (e.g., the implicit
beliefs scale or the learning strategies scale).

Our research has shown that self-regulation in the academic domain is systematically
associated with mindfulness and with an emotional balance favouring the positive. These

123

Mindfulness and Achievement

associations suggest that self-regulation is a highly adaptive attribute, a quality recently
recognized within the area of positive psychology in which self-regulation is viewed as one
of 24 strengths of character. Self-regulation is one of six indices of the virtue of temper-
ance and is deﬁned as ‘‘how a person exerts control over his or her own responses so as to
pursue goals and live up to standards’’ (Peterson and Seligman 2004, p. 500). Self-regu-
lation as a character strength is described by Peterson and Seligman (2004) as having
several adaptive correlates, including successful academic performance but also positive
relationship functioning and lower rates of psychopathology. Moreover, research has
shown that the character strength of self-regulation, as assessed with the Values in Action
Inventory of Strengths (Peterson and Seligman 2004), is positively associated with indices
of well-being including life satisfaction, engagement, and meaning (Park et al. 2004;
Peterson et al. 2007). It is also noteworthy that of the 24 character strengths, self-regulation
is typically among the very lowest in terms of self-endorsement, a ﬁnding consistent
among English-speaking residents of a large number of nations (Park et al. 2006). Within
this context, we suggest two routes for further exploration: First, we echo the argument of
Peterson and Seligman (2004) that self-regulation is a ‘‘vital psychological strength that is
crucial to personal well-being and, accordingly should be amply cultivated and fostered’’
(p. 516). Mindfulness may be one means by which self-regulation can be cultivated (Evans
et al. 2009; Feltman et al. 2009; Jha et al. 2010; Lykins and Baer 2009; Napoli et al. 2005;
Palmer and Rodger 2009; Radel et al. 2009; Shao and Skarlicki 2009; Singh et al. 2003),
although additional experimental research on the induction of mindful states and their
impact on self-regulation is needed. Second, we encourage greater cross-fertilization of
research in achievement-related self-regulation and positive psychology, two domains that
have yet to be extensively integrated. For example, self-regulation as a strength of char-
acter has not yet been examined comprehensively in relation to students’ functioning (e.g.,
their levels of achievement; the nature of their implicit theories; the content of their goals).
It would appear fruitful for research to examine such associations, including their relative
magnitudes vis a vis the remaining strengths of character. As a recent example of this
approach, Lounsbury, Fisher, Levy, and Welsh (2009) showed that self-regulation was
among the character strengths most associated with academic achievement and with col-
lege satisfaction. Such research has the potential to lend credence to self-regulation as an
important strength of character, and to support the application of strengths of character and
perhaps other positive psychology constructs to achievement-related functioning (see, e.g.,
Moore and Lippman, 2005; Park and Peterson 2009).
