How do protein get back to the ER if 
they escape to the Golgi?  
 

SNAREs are retrieved to their initial membrane due to 
their interaction with coats („cargo“) 
 
ER resident proteins carry a C-terminal retrieval signal 
(KDEL, HDEL), which is recognized by the KDEL 
receptor 
 
It cycles between ER and Golgi. 
 
This mechanism is abused by viruses, which surf along 
the Golgi-ER pathway to the ER.

Function and composition of vesicle coats 

•  Coats assemble on membranes with the help of additional factors: Arf or 

Sar GTPases, PI lipids, cargo 

•  Coats like COPII assemble in two layers, which are found in others as 
well. The inner layer binds cargo and cooperates with the GTPase, the 
outer layer structures the coat 

•  COPI (Golgi) has seven subunits, exists as one unit 
•  PI-lipids and cargo induce large conformational change on coats, which 

allow polymerization 

•  Polymerization follows the order of symmetry and can be flexible to adopt 

larger cargoes (like collagen) 

•  Membran deformation is driven by helper proteins like Sar1, Arf1 or BAR 

domain proteins 

•  Scission from membranes requires sometimes helper like Dynamin (at 

the plasma membrane)

Where does membrane fusion occur in cells?

-  Within the endomembrane system – SNAREs 
-  Between viruses and cells – viral fusion proteins (HA etc.) 
-  Between cells – cell fusion proteins (EFF/AFF, FAST proteins) 
 
-  Between mitochondria and ER sites – Atlastin, mitofusin (GTPases)

•  Conserved proteins, essential in vivo 
•  Four in yeast (Vps33, Sec1, Vps45, Sly1) 
•  Belong to one family with a conserved fold

Summary: SNAREs 

Model of SNAREs between membranes 
(synaptic SNAREs) 

25 in yeast, 36 in humans 

•  SNAREs are anchored to membranes via C-terminal TMDs 
•  Mostly small (25-35 kD) 
• 
•  They have N-terminal regulatory domains 
•  Upon fusion, SNAREs form four-helix bundles 
•  Zippering of SNAREs results in folding and consequently fusion 
•  Recycling of SNAREs requires the AAA-ATPase NSF, its cofactor α-SNAP 

and ATP-hydrolysis 

Where does membrane fusion occur in cells?

-  Within the endomembrane system – SNAREs 
-  Between viruses and cells – viral fusion proteins (HA etc.) 
-  Between cells – cell fusion proteins (EFF/AFF, FAST proteins) 
 
-  Between mitochondria and ER sites – Atlastin, mitofusion (GTPases)

Viral membrane fusion via strong conformational changes 

Flavivirus E 
Fusion protein 

Influenza Virus: 
Hemagglutinin (HA) 

Summary: Viral fusion proteins 

•  Have a similar fold like SNAREs (mostly coiled-coils) 
•  Exist in an inactive conformation on membranes 
•  Require activation, which leads to a large conformational change; this can occur 

• 

for instance at low pH;  
(e.g. Influenza virus is first endocytosed and then fuses with the endosomal 
membrane at low pH) 

•  The fusion peptide then inserts into the opposite membrane; it provides the 

second membrane anchor. 

•  Viral fusion proteins are not recycled (unlike SNAREs) 

Where does membrane fusion occur in cells?

-  Within the endomembrane system – SNAREs 
-  Between viruses and cells – viral fusion proteins (HA etc.) 
-  Between cells – cell fusion proteins (EFF/AFF, FAST proteins)

EFF-1 fuses cells

Science, 2011 

Summary: Cell-Cell fusion proteins 

•  Required to fuse cell membranes (tube formation; sperm-egg fusion; placenta; 

muscle cells) 

•  Have similar properties like viral fusion proteins 
•  Are stored initially in vesicles and are exposed on cells upon exocytosis  
•  Many different forms exist; this applies only to EFF-1

Atlastin-mediated membrane fusion

•  Atlastins are similar to mitofusins of the outer mitochondrial 

membranes 
Involved in membrane fusion at the ER 

• 
•  GTPase has similarity to dynamin-like proteins 

Moss et al., 2011 

Atlastin-mediated membrane fusion

•  Atlastins are ER-resident proteins that can 

drive fusion between ER membranes 

•  This requires a large conformational change 
•  Both the interaction of the GTPases and the 

coiled-coil domains are required

Summary: Tethers 

•  Come in two flavors: coiled-coil tethers (mostly dimers); tethering complexes 
•  Coiled-coil tethers might restrict diffusion of cargo, function at fusion not yet 

entirely clear at fusion site 

•  Tethering complexes bind to Rabs (mostly) and SNAREs (mostly) to facilitate 

fusion 

•  Two families: CATHR (Dsl, exocyst....) and Class C Vps complexes (HOPS and 

CORVET) 

•  Rab-GTP directs a tether to one membrane; some tethers bind SM- protein 

(SNARE chaperones) 

•  Make sure that fusion occurs precisely at one position and with high efficiency 
•  Conserved between species
