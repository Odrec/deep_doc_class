appropriate for the proper protection of investors and to insure fair dealing in the security-- 

(1) such information and documents (and such copies thereof) as the Commission shall require to 
keep reasonably current the information and documents required to be included in or filed with an

(2) Every issuer which has a class of securities registered pursuant to section 78l of this title and 
every issuer which is required to file reports pursuant to section 78o(d) of this title shall-- 

(A) make and keep books, records, and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly 
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the issuer; and 

(B) devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable 
assurances that-- 

(i) transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or specific authorization; 

(ii) transactions are recorded as necessary (I) to permit preparation of financial statements in 
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles or any other criteria applicable to such 
statements, and (II) to maintain accountability for assets; 

(iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management's general or specific 
authorization; and 

(iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals 
and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences. 

(3)  (A) With respect to matters concerning the national security of the United States, no duty or 

liability under paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be imposed upon any person acting in 
cooperation with the head of any Federal department or agency responsible for such 
matters if such act in cooperation with such head of a department or agency was done upon 
the specific, written directive of the head of such department or agency pursuant to 
Presidential authority to issue such directives. Each directive issued under this paragraph 
shall set forth the specific facts and circumstances with respect to which the provisions of 
this paragraph are to be invoked. Each such directive shall, unless renewed in writing, 
expire one year after the date of issuance. 
(B) Each head of a Federal department or agency of the United States who issues such a 
directive pursuant to this paragraph shall maintain a complete file of all such directives and 
shall, on October 1 of each year, transmit a summary of matters covered by such directives 
in force at any time during the previous year to the Permanent Select Committee on 
Intelligence of the House of Representatives and the Select Committee on Intelligence of 
the Senate. 

 

(4) No criminal liability shall be imposed for failing to comply with the requirements of paragraph (2)

accounting controls or knowingly falsify any book, record, or account described in paragraph (2).

issuer which is required to file reports pursuant to section 78o(d) of this title holds 50 per centum or 
less of the voting power with respect to a domestic or foreign firm, the provisions of paragraph (2) 
require only that the issuer proceed in good faith to use its influence, to the extent reasonable under 
the issuer's circumstances, to cause such domestic or foreign firm to devise and maintain a system of 
internal accounting controls consistent with paragraph (2). Such circumstances include the relative 
degree of the issuer's ownership of the domestic or foreign firm and the laws and practices governing 
the business operations of the country in which such firm is located. An issuer which demonstrates 
good faith efforts to use such influence shall be conclusively presumed to have complied with the 
requirements of paragraph (2). 

(7) For the purpose of paragraph (2) of this subsection, the terms "reasonable assurances" and 
"reasonable detail" mean such level of detail and degree of assurance as would satisfy prudent officials 
in the conduct of their own affairs.
