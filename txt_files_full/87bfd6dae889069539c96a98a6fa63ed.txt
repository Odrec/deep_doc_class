Eukaryotic replication disrupts each nucleosome as the fork passes, followed by reassembly of disrupted nu-
cleosomes and incorporation of newly synthesized histones into nucleosomes in the daughter genomes. In this
review, we examine this process of replication-coupled nucleosome assembly to understand how characteristic
steady-state nucleosome landscapes are attained. Recent studies have begun to elucidate mechanisms involved in
histone transfer during replication and maturation of the nucleosome landscape after disruption by replication. A
fuller understanding of replication-coupled nucleosome assembly will be needed to explain how epigenetic
information is replicated at every cell division.

INTRODUCTION

Animals and plants develop from a single-celled zygote to a multicel-
lular organism with scores of different cell types that perform a multitude
of unique functions and yet carry the same genome. This diversity in
cellular identity during development and adulthood is achieved by dif-
ferential gene activation and repression in distinct cell types. Gene ex-
pression is influenced by nucleosomes, which mediate accessibility and
hence all biochemical activities on the genome. The overall inhibitory
role of nucleosomes on genomic access is modulated by posttransla-
tional modifications of histones in the nucleosome and the replace-
ment of canonical histones in the nucleosome by histone variants.
Thus, the pattern of differential gene expression that contributes to
cellular identity is reflected in features that differentiate nucleosomes
along the genome, the “nucleosome landscape.” The major histone
modifications classically associated with repressed chromatin domains
include H3K9 trimethylation (H3K9me3), which is found in consti-
tutive heterochromatin, and H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), which
is found in facultative heterochromatin. The major histone variants
include H3.3, H2A.Z, and the centromeric H3 variant, cenH3. In meta-
zoans, H3.3 and H2A.Z are broadly distributed throughout the ge-
nome, but are differentially enriched at particular regions including
actively transcribed regions, whereas cenH3 is rarely found outside
of centromeres.

The nucleosome landscape of different cell types is established in
large part through processes that disrupt and replace nucleosomes,
mainly transcription, chromatin remodeling, and replication. Exam-
ples of transcription and remodeling establishing the cell type–specific
nucleosome landscape include widespread transcription at enhancers
(1), remodeling (2), and nucleosome turnover (3) at Polycomb response
elements (PREs) in Drosophila, which are sites required for maintain-
ing cell type–specific transcriptional programs through several cell divi-
sions during development.

For eukaryotic development to proceed, the nucleosome landscape
must be reproduced by default in daughter cells after DNA replication,
which proceeds bidirectionally from origins bound by the origin recog-
nition complex. The replication fork consists minimally of the mini-
chromosome maintenance (MCM) helicase and DNA polymerase,
both of which are loaded at replication origins at the beginning of re-
plication, and the replicative processivity clamp, PCNA. The MCM
complex forms a channel around a single strand of DNA (the leading

strand of replication) and unwinds DNA in front of it (4). An MCM
channel translocating on single-stranded DNA will result in the com-
plete disruption of the nucleosome. Thus, over a few seconds of passage
of the helicase and the replication machinery behind, there is massive
disruption that dissociates the prereplication nucleosome landscape.

After the new strand of DNA is synthesized by the polymerase, as-
sembly factors reconstitute old nucleosomes and assemble new nucleo-
somes behind the replication fork. Because there is a doubling of genetic
material during replication, cells require double the amount of the ge-
nome packing material, namely, the histones. To provide sufficient
material at S phase, there is massive synthesis of the four canonical
histones, which form the nucleosome core that wraps 147 base pairs
(bp) of DNA, and the linker histone H1, which cements an additional
~20-bp DNA wrap to the nucleosome surface. Newly replicated chro-
matin must incorporate both the preexisting histones disrupted by the
replication fork and the newly synthesized histones. The main ques-
tions for elucidating the inheritance of nucleosome features during rep-
lication are as follows: How are old and new histones incorporated
during replication-coupled nucleosome assembly? How is the nucleo-
some landscape altered during replication?

Stable inheritance of epigenetic information through replication is
exemplified by cytosine methylation at CG dinucleotides in most
animals and plants. At CG dinucleotides, methylation is symmetric,
that is, the cytosine on both strands is methylated. At replication, each
daughter CG dinucleotide inherits one of the two symmetrically methy-
lated cytosines from the parental strand, base-paired to an unmethylated
cytosine on the newly synthesized strand, that is, a hemimethylated CG
dinucleotide. The Dnmt1 methyltransferase recognizes the hemi-
methylated CG dinucleotide and methylates the cytosine on the newly
synthesized strand. Thus, the methylation status of parental CG dinu-
cleotides is inherited by the daughter chromosomes through the hemi-
methylated state. In this review, we describe examples where
nucleosomes are “replicated” on the daughter chromosomes analogous
to cytosine methylation at CG dinucleotides, with the goal of delineat-
ing the underlying mechanisms.

NUCLEOSOME INHERITANCE THROUGH REPLICATION

To understand how nucleosomes are inherited through replication, we
need to first consider the constraints posed by the structure of the nu-
cleosome. The nucleosome core consists of the centrally located H3-H4
tetramer flanked on either side by an H2A-H2B dimer. Nucleosomal
DNA enters at the “proximal” H2A-H2B dimer and exits at the “distal”

H2A-H2B dimer. The twofold mirror symmetry of the nucleosome
means that half the length of nucleosomal DNA (73 bp) wraps one-half
of the histone octamer consisting of one each of the H2A-H2B and
H3-H4 dimers. DNA-histone contacts at the entry and exit sites of the
nucleosome are the most labile, and these contacts can be lost during
normal thermal fluctuations, resulting in transient unwrapping of nu-
cleosomes (5). This results in H2A-H2B dimers being more susceptible
to loss and replacement than H3-H4. In contrast, the central location of
the H3-H4 tetramer is expected to restrain its turnover, which in exper-
imental measurements is markedly lower than that of H2A-H2B (6).
Tracking nucleosome inheritance then becomes primarily a problem
of tracking the H3-H4 tetramer through replication.

The nucleosome landscape as defined by the identity of H3 and H4
would be marked by H3 variants H3.1/H3.2 or H3.3 and posttransla-
tional modifications on H3 and H4. Posttranslational modifications
associated with active chromatin are predominantly found on H3.3
compared to H3.1/H3.2, whereas modifications that are part of the
machinery involved in repression (H3K27me and H3K9me) are pre-
dominantly found on H3.1/H3.2 (7). Inheritance of a silenced region
through replication would in some scenarios involve inheritance of
H3-bearing modifications associated with repression at the same ge-
nomic location. Alternatively, the silenced region could be set up afresh
each time after replication. Of the several modes of nucleosome assembly,
replication-coupled assembly is distinguished by the fact that the canon-
ical H3 (H3.1 and H3.2, hereinafter referred to as H3) is incorporated
into chromatin only through this pathway (8). Replication-independent
pathways of nucleosome assembly strictly incorporate only H3.3 (8).

Given alternative pathways and mechanisms to maintain the nu-
cleosome landscape, we need to determine what is the relative signif-
icance of replication-coupled assembly in maintaining the nucleosome
landscape through inheritance. Whereas histones are essential, disrup-
tion of replication-coupled assembly is not lethal in the budding yeast,
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, indicating that nucleosome assembly path-
ways are largely redundant in this organism. However, disruption of
replication-coupled assembly results in derepression of silent loci (9–12).
A requirement for replication-coupled assembly to maintain silencing
is also seen in the worm, Caenorhabditis elegans, where deletion of 11
residues in the H3 C terminus in 1 of 24 H3 genes results in the loss of
asymmetry in the identities of a neuron pair (13). Deletion of these re-
sidues in H3 is predicted to destabilize the nucleosome due to loss of
contacts that stabilize the H3-H4 tetramer interface. The H3 C-terminal
deletion is phenocopied by disruption of replication-coupled assembly,
which suggests that impaired replication-coupled assembly can affect
developmental decisions. Here, similar to the situation in budding yeast,
inefficient assembly or assembly of destabilized nucleosomes (with mu-
tant H3) results in replication-independent assembly pathways filling
in the “holes” in the nucleosome landscape with H3.3 after replication.
The replication-coupled assembly pathway is also essential for devel-
opment in plants (Arabidopsis thaliana) (14, 15) and in flies (Drosophila
melanogaster) (16, 17), even in the presence of alternate nucleosome assem-
bly pathways. In cultured human cells, disruption of replication-coupled
assembly results in increased replication-independent incorporation of
H3.3 (18). Because old H3.3 is enriched in histone modifications that
are primarily associated with active chromatin, it is possible that
spurious incorporation of H3.3 could disrupt silencing at inactive
regions.

The importance of replication-coupled nucleosome assembly in
maintaining silent chromatin states in yeast and for proper devel-

opment in worms, flies, and plants suggests a role for this pathway in
epigenetic inheritance. Direct evidence for the essentiality of the main-
tenance of histone variants through replication is exemplified by cenH3,
the histone variant that replaces H3 at centromeres. Loss of cenH3 main-
tenance through replication can result in loss of centromere identity (19).

TRACKING CHROMATIN INHERITANCE
THROUGH REPLICATION

Nucleosome inheritance would involve not only the transfer of old
histone variants and posttranslational modifications to the newly syn-
thesized chromosomes but also preservation of the genomic location
of the old histones. In principle, we can track nucleosome inheritance
at multiple levels: in bulk, at the level of genomes or chromosomes, at
the level of large chromatin domains (~10 kb), and at the single nu-
cleosome level. Currently, we have solid evidence for chromatin inher-
itance only at the bulk level.

Several methods have been developed recently to temporally track
proteins associated with replication forks by isolating newly replicated
chromatin labeled with nucleotide analogs (20–22). Combining the
isolation of newly replicated chromatin with differential labeling of
old and new histones with stable isotopes has enabled the quantifica-
tion of the extent of transfer of old, modified histones and histone
variants at the replication fork (23). This method also has high tem-
poral resolution, enabling pulse-chase experiments to track the matu-
ration of newly assembled chromatin over time. In cultured human
cells, this method showed that only a small fraction of old H2A.Z is
retained in the newly replicated chromatin and that H2A.Z is incor-
porated much later than fork progression, indicating little or no inher-
itance of H2A.Z during replication. H3.3 levels in newly replicated
chromatin are the same as in bulk chromatin, indicating fast incorpo-
ration of both old and new H3.3 into the newly replicated chromatin.
Thus, with respect to histone variants, H3.3 levels drop twofold immedi-
ately after replication, indicative of random segregation to both daughter
chromosomes, whereas H2A.Z levels drop much more, indicating loss of
H2A.Z in the daughter chromosomes. With respect to histone mod-
ifications, the newly replicated chromatin has half the levels of
H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 compared to total H3. This could be
attributed to equal distribution of old H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 be-
tween the daughter chromosomes, as evidenced by the lack of these
methylation marks in newly synthesized H3.

H3K27me3 is deposited by the Polycomb repressive complex 2
(PRC2) (24, 25). H3K27me3 is part of the machinery that maintains
transcriptional repression of large chromatin domains over successive
cell divisions (26). In the embryonic germ line of worm hermaphro-
dites, H3K27me3 is maintained by PRC2 on maternal chromosomes
but remains absent from previously unmodified paternal chromosomes
(27). Conversely, in a PRC2 null embryo, H3K27me3 containing pater-
nal chromosomes retain the modified nucleosomes during twofold
dilution at each cell division. This provides direct evidence of post-
translationally modified histone inheritance through successive cell
divisions (27).

Spatially restricted inheritance of old histones has also been ob-
served in germline stem cells in fly testes (28). These stem cells are at-
tached to a cellular structure called the hub, and the daughter cells that
go on to differentiate can be clearly distinguished from the stem cells
spatially. When the fates of old and newly synthesized histones were

Fig. 1. Distinct mechanisms of incorporation of H3.3 at active and silent regions of the genome. At transcriptionally active regions, nucleo-
somes are disrupted by RNA polymerase or nucleosome remodelers, resulting in occasional nucleosome loss, with replacement by nucleosomes
containing H3.3, which unlike H3 is present throughout the cell cycle. At regions of unusual base composition, which include telomeres, CpG
islands, and short-period satellite repeats, the lack of nucleosome-stabilizing sequences results in relatively frequent nucleosome loss, with replace-
ment by H3.3 nucleosomes.

traced over mitosis, there was a striking observation that old histones
are preferentially retained in the chromosomes that segregated to the
stem cell. Similarly, histones newly synthesized during the most recent
S phase are preferentially retained in the chromosomes that segregate
to the differentiating daughter cell. Thus, retention of old histones cor-
relates with stem cell identity in the fly testes.

In summary, in ordinary cell divisions, there is equal distribution
of old H3, H3.3, H3K27me3, and H3K9me3 to daughter chromosomes.
Newly synthesized H3 lacks these methyls when deposited, resulting in
a dilution of cellular levels of methylated H3 right after replication (23).
At least in the case of H3K27me3, this distribution to daughter chro-
mosomes occurs locally in worm embryos, thus preserving the genomic
location of the old H3K27me3 (27). Similarly for cenH3, genomic loca-
tion is preserved after replication in multiple organisms, and the total
levels are diluted to one-half after replication (29). In budding yeast,
there is no inheritance of cenH3, because the single cenH3 nucleosome
at each centromere is lost during replication (30).

MECHANISMS FOR INHERITING NUCLEOSOME STATES
THROUGH REPLICATION

Different genomic regions feature distinct mechanisms to maintain
chromatin states after nucleosome disruption and dilution due to re-
plication. Transcriptionally active regions are enriched for nucleosomes
containing H3.3 and H2A.Z, both of which are exclusively incor-
porated by replication-independent nucleosome assembly pathways.
H3.3 incorporation mirrors nucleosome turnover (3), presumably be-
cause, outside of replication, canonical H3 is not synthesized, and so
H3.3 is the only substrate available to replace the H3 that is lost. H3.3-
specific chaperones include DAXX (31, 32) and HIRA (33), both of
which selectively bind H3.3 over canonical H3. Thus, transcriptionally
active regions and other sites that feature elevated rates of nucleosome
turnover would accumulate H3.3 (34). Accumulation of H2A.Z at pro-
moters and gene bodies has been proposed to be driven by disruption of
H2A-H2B dimers from the nucleosome during transcription (35). Simi-
larly, enhancers feature high nucleosome remodeler activity (36) and
transcription (1), which is also reflected by high nucleosome turnover

(37), explaining the enrichment of H3.3 and H2A.Z at these sites. Tran-
scriptionally silent regions of unusual base composition that lack
nucleosome-stabilizing features, such as short period tandem repeats,
telomeric repeats, and intergenic CpG islands, also show evidence of
high nucleosome turnover (38–41). Thus, the context of H3.3 incor-
poration dictates whether H3.3 is associated with active or silent chroma-
tin states (Fig. 1). In summary, events outside of replication can overcome
dilution of H3.3 and H2A.Z during replication-coupled assembly and
dynamically maintain H3.3 and H2A.Z landscapes.

Histone modifications are diluted by half during replication. Hence,
it is interesting to determine whether the modified histone levels imme-
diately before replication or immediately after replication are required
for their biological function. The replenishment of H3K27me3 and
H3K9me3 landscapes is a slow process, completing only before the
next round of replication, which indicates that lower postreplication
levels are enough for the biological function of these modified histones
(23). This suggests that methylation of newly synthesized histones
before the subsequent S phase exists primarily to prevent further di-
lution of these landscapes over the next round of replication rather than
to maintain silencing in the absence of replication. In vitro (42) and in
vivo (43), evidence suggest that the diluted, old H3K27me3 can target
methylating machinery to nearby nucleosomes containing newly syn-
thesized histones. The PRC2 complex includes a catalytic subunit and
an EED subunit (Esc in fly). Structural and biochemical characteriza-
tions of EED have revealed its ability to bind H3K27me3, a modifica-
tion that is catalyzed by the EZH2 subunit of the PRC2 complex (42).
When EED binds H3K27me3, the enzymatic activity of EZH2 increases
sevenfold in vitro (42), leading to a template-binding model (Fig. 2)
where binding of EED to old H3K27me3 could stimulate the activity
of EZH2 on nucleosomes with newly synthesized histones that are
not yet methylated. This model requires faithful inheritance of old his-
tones on daughter chromosomes close to their original location on the
parent chromosome and is yet to be directly demonstrated in vivo. A
subunit of PRC2 in the budding yeast Cryptococcus neoformans, Ccc1,
also binds H3K27me3 (43). The specific binding of Ccc1 to H3K27me3 is
required for the maintenance of H3K27me3 and silencing of genes at sub-
telomeric regions. The action of Ccc1 might be explained in either of two
ways: Ccc1 binding old H3K27me3 could direct PRC2 to methylate

Fig. 2. Three models of propagating histone modifications through replication. In the template-binding model (42), adjacent nucleosomes are
modified by a histone-modifying enzyme that binds the modified residue on a nearby tail. In the constitutive model (47), H3K27 methylation is
restored by recognition of H3A31 but not H3.3T31 by ATXR5/6, such that only replication-coupled (H3) nucleosomes, not replication-independent
(H3.3) nucleosomes, are methylated on H3K27. In the bridging model (48), PRC1 bridges nucleosomes across daughter chromatids.

nearby nucleosomes with newly synthesized histones, or alternately,
Ccc1 could be required for protection of H3K27me3 deposited by PRC2
from demethylation. The deposition of H3K27me3 in newly synthe-
sized histones has been shown to occur during the G1-S transition in cul-
tured fly cells (44) and at a slow rate over the whole cell cycle in human
cultured cells (23). Thus, after dilution during replication, the old
H3K27me3 in conjunction with the EED subunit of PRC2 might lead
to the methylation of the same or nearby nucleosome tails containing
unmethylated H3.

The levels and localization of PRC2 could play important roles in
maintaining H3K27 methylation levels through replication as evidenced by
the up-regulation of PRC2 subunits during S phase in human cells (45)
and rapid localization of PRC2 components to newly replicated chro-
matin in fly embryos (46) and in human cells (21). Another possible

way to maintain H3K27 methylation after replication at silent do-
mains would be for the histone methyltransferase to travel with the
replication fork and methylate newly assembled nucleosomes. This
mechanism has been most definitively worked out in plants (47). His-
tone methyltransferases ATRX5/6 are essential for heterochromatin
condensation in plants. The crystal structure of ATRX5 with H3 shows
that one of the amino acid differences between H3 and H3.3, Ala31
(compared to Thr31 of H3.3, a difference that is conserved between
plants and animals), is critical for recognition of the H3 tail by
ATRX5/6. Replacement of alanine by threonine at position 31 of H3
abrogates the ability of ATRX5 to methylate H3. Thus, one of the four
amino acid differences between H3 and H3.3 is used by ATRX5/6 to
specifically methylate H3 and not H3.3. During replication, ATRX5
can monomethylate newly synthesized H3, whereas active regions

containing H3.3 are protected because of ATRX5/6’s specificity for
H3. Thus, a key histone modification that is needed for hetero-
chromatin compaction is specified only by the replication-coupled
H3 variant, where the methylated form of Lys27 is constitutively spec-
ified by Ala31 (Fig. 2). Notably, protein methyltransferases are still being
discovered in metazoans, and a mechanism similar to that adopted by
ATRX5/6 may yet be found in the animal kingdom.

Maintenance of chromatin states through replication could also be
dependent on the action of non-histone chromatin proteins at the rep-
lication fork. The bridging model (48) requires a non-histone chromatin
protein to have the ability both to bind nucleosomes and to oligomer-
ize (Fig. 2). For example, PRC1 compacts chromatin by forming clus-
ters with nucleosomes and other PRC1 complexes. In vitro, PRC1
clusters have been found to bridge old nucleosomes in front of the fork
with newly assembled nucleosomes behind the fork, thus transferring
the seed for compaction from the old chromosome to the daughter
chromosome (48). PRC1 has been further shown to bridge the two
daughter chromosomes also, which would ensure that the nucleosomes
on the Okazaki fragment are also bound by PRC1 (Fig. 2), even though
they are assembled by a fork that does not encounter PRC1 (48).

In summary, the dilution of posttranslationally modified histones
during replication may be mitigated by distinct mechanisms in distinct
contexts: (i) gradual replenishment during the remainder of the cell
cycle, (ii) replenishment just during the G1-S transition as seen in cultured
animal cells, (iii) by concurrent modification of histones during replica-
tion fork movement as seen in plants, and (iv) bridging of non-histone
chromatin proteins across the fork and between the two daughter chro-
mosomes. The current mechanisms proposed for propagating nu-
cleosome landscapes through replication can be encapsulated into three
models: template binding, constitutive, and bridging (Fig. 2). In the
template-binding model, the modifying machinery recognizes old nu-
cleosomes and then modifies the nearby nucleosomes that contain
newly synthesized histones. In the constitutive model that is exemplified
by action of ATRX5/6 at the replication fork, the mode of assembly of

H3 would determine its ultimate fate. This model posits that replication-
independent assembly incorporates H3.3, which would acquire modifi-
cations associated with the chromatin state where it is being
incorporated, whereas replication-coupled H3 is assembled by default
in a neutral or silenced state. In the bridging model, non-histone chro-
matin proteins bridge replication forks and the two daughter chromo-
somes to maintain compact chromatin states through fork passage. The
mechanisms of transfer of histones and non-histone proteins at replication
forks will ultimately determine which model is involved in maintaining
nucleosome landscapes at different genomic locations.

THE UNIT OF CHROMATIN THAT IS INHERITED
THROUGH REPLICATION

The discontinuity and asymmetry of replication have implications for
old nucleosome disruption and assembly of new nucleosomes onto
daughter chromosomes. The helicase that unwinds DNA proceeds on
the leading strand, on which DNA synthesis is performed by polymer-
ase h (49). DNA unwinding leaves a lagging strand that is initially rep-
licated by polymerase a and then by polymerase d in discontinuous
steps to produce the so-called Okazaki fragments (49). With respect to
chromatin, leading strand synthesis involves nucleosome disruption,
thus having first access to old histones, whereas Okazaki synthesis
does not encounter old histones during fork passage. Thus, one could
imagine an asymmetry in the extent of old histones in nucleosome
arrays assembled by leading and lagging strands, with the old histones
being retained on the leading strand and the new histones on the
lagging strand. As multiple origins fire bidirectionally over the length
of the chromosome, asymmetry between old nucleosome retention and
new nucleosome assembly would average out over the whole chromo-
some. Early experiments suggested that under most circumstances, his-
tones are symmetrically distributed between leading and lagging
strands. Electron microscopy of S-phase chromatin from rapidly dividing

Drosophila blastoderm nuclei visualized closely spaced replication bubbles
(50). In these images, one could not distinguish any difference in the
presence of free DNA in the leading and lagging strand. All studies to
date have detected no more than 200 bp of nucleosome-free DNA
behind the replication fork. Furthermore, independent labeling of DNA
and histones through several generations of cells in culture has shown
that there is no preference for old histones on either leading or lagging
strands (51). Thus, these studies suggest that there is no leading-versus-
lagging strand bias in the distribution of old-versus-new nucleosomes.
DNA replication and CG methylation are both semiconservative
processes, in which each parental strand templates its newly synthe-
sized complement. In the case of nucleosomes, the issue of semicon-
servative versus conservative replication (Fig. 3) has been a matter of
continuing debate since shortly after the discovery of nucleosomes in
1974 (52, 53). By differentially labeling old and newly synthesized his-
tones with dense amino acids, several studies have shown that octamers
contain either only old histones or only new histones, that is, newly
synthesized histones are not combined with old histones to form nucleo-
somes during replication-coupled assembly in bulk (54–57). The con-
servative transfer of histones was further narrowed down to H3-H4
specifically, when it was observed that old H2A-H2B could be part of
nucleosomes that contained either old H3-H4 or newly synthesized
H3-H4 (58, 59). These studies were confirmed by an orthogonal method
that involved incorporation of fluorescently labeled H3 in the species
Physarum microplasmodia (60). When two labeled H3 molecules were
part of the same nucleosome, there would be a fluorescence resonance
energy transfer (FRET) signal. Initial incorporation resulted in nucleo-
somes containing two copies of labeled H3. Then, the fluorescence
was tracked in the absence of any new incorporation of labeled H3,
which would mean that after one cell cycle, all the labeled H3 would
represent the old H3. Over several cell cycles, the FRET signal persisted
over the fluorescence of a single H3, indicating that the old H3 re-
mained in the same (H3-H4)2 even after replication, confirming the
bulk isotope labeling studies. Thus, H3-H4 is transferred conservative-
ly during replication. In contrast to bulk chromatin, active chromatin
has been characterized to have a mixture of old and new histones form-
ing the octamer, indicating that nucleosome assembly during active pro-
cesses independent of replication involves mixing of old and newly
synthesized nucleosomes (61).

These early studies demonstrating a lack of mixing of old H3-H4
with newly synthesized H3-H4 were confirmed by differential labeling
of old and new histones followed by mass spectrometry (MS), which
offers an unambiguous identification of the proteins forming nucleo-
somes (8, 62). Amino acid substitutions of H3 toward H3.3 are enough
for it to be incorporated by replication-independent pathways, indicat-
ing the separation of incorporation pathways to be inherent to the
histone variant. Compared to earlier studies in bulk that looked at
transfer of old histones during replication, a major advance of the re-
cent mass spectroscopy analysis was the ability to distinguish H3 and
H3.3 (62). The MS analysis of newly assembled nucleosomes revealed
that whenever a nucleosome contained an old H3 subunit, both H3 sub-
units were old. Thus, in line with the early studies, it was confirmed that
the canonical H3 is not inherited through a half-nucleosome template.
The same study found that 20% of the nucleosomes containing one
old replication-independent variant H3.3 subunit contained a newly syn-
thesized H3.3 as the other subunit. A follow-up study that mapped the
genome-wide locations of nucleosomes containing one copy of old
H3.3 and one copy of newly synthesized H3.3 found them predom-

inantly at enhancers (37). The differential behavior of H3 and H3.3 is
reflective of their distinct modes of incorporation into chromatin.

What can we conclude about replication-coupled nucleosome as-
sembly based on the observation that individual nucleosomes generally
replicate conservatively? One possibility is that old H3-H4 tetramers
or whole octamers are transferred intact from the parental chromosome
to the daughter chromosome (Fig. 3, single nucleosome). Another pos-
sibility is that nucleosomes are disassembled and reassembled to accom-
modate passage of the replication fork, which is suggested by the action
of Asf1, a histone chaperone that binds an H3-H4 dimer and facilitates
histone octamer disruption. The fact that the binding interface between
Asf1 and H3-H4 precludes H3-H4 tetramer formation (63, 64) and that
Asf1 is required for fork passage (65) suggests that the histone octamer
is disrupted ahead of the fork into histone dimers. Similar to Asf1, the
other H3-H4 chaperone, Caf1, also binds H3-H4 dimers (66). Hence,
although old nucleosomes are disrupted to dimers during fork passage,
the old H3-H4 dimers do not mix with newly synthesized H3-H4 di-
mers when incorporated into nucleosomes. However, old and new his-
tones make up equal parts of the newly replicated chromatin in bulk.
Thus, nucleosomes with all-old H3-H4 or all-new H3-H4 could be as-
sembled at random on each daughter chromatid, leading to equal dis-
tribution of nucleosomes with solely old H3-H4 or new H3-H4 over a
nucleosome array (Fig. 3, semiconservative nucleosome array).

Fig. 4. Probability of faithful inheritance at various thresholds of old
histone segregation. Given that old (H3-H4)2 is segregated randomly to
daughter chromosomes during replication, we can think of each nucleo-
some assembled as a Bernoulli trial, with the probability of a daughter
chromosome assembling a nucleosome with old (H3-H4)2 the same as
the probability of assembling a nucleosome with new (H3-H4)2, both of
which would be 0.5. We can then ask, what is the probability that at least
a given percentage of old (H3-H4)2 in a nucleosome array of a given size is
obtained by a daughter chromosome? The x axis of this plot represents the
different nucleosome array sizes. The y axis represents the probability of
the daughter chromosome getting at least a given percentage of old
(H3-H4)2. We define this binomial probability as the probability of faithful
inheritance. The dashed gray line represents the minimum size of the nu-
cleosome array that would ensure faithful inheritance of at least 33% of old
(H3-H4)2.

The inheritance of a mixture of old and new nucleosomes over a
nucleosome array has implications for distinguishing between the
template model and the assembly model. The minimal region required
for stable inheritance of silenced domains through replication has been
best characterized in flies, where PREs are required for stable silencing
of homeotic genes through replication. PREs are ~700 bp, only enough
for about three nucleosomes, but the silenced domains are in the scale
of kilobases. If we look at the inheritance of nucleosomes at PREs alone
through replication, based on the inheritance model we have described,
during one of eight instances of the replication of a PRE, the newly rep-
licated PRE will have all three nucleosomes consisting of newly synthe-
sized H3-H4. Hence, if the epigenetic information were carried through
old histones, this would be completely lost in one of eight times at the
PRE (67). We can extend this idea to explore the minimum number of
contiguous nucleosomes that could be inherited faithfully through
replication. At maximum, only 50% of the time can daughter chromo-
somes faithfully acquire 50% or more of old nucleosomes (Fig. 4).
Hence, 50% of the time, there will be loss of inheritance. At least 33%
of old nucleosomes can be faithfully acquired by daughter chromo-
somes if the domain size is at least 54 nucleosomes (or ~10 kb). That
is, 10 kb is the minimum size of a nucleosome domain in which at
least 33% of nucleosomes can be faithfully inherited. This estimate
agrees with the size of silent domains that are maintained around PREs
through several rounds of replication during fly development. So for
replication-coupled H3, the template model could operate over re-
gions that span tens of kilobases of DNA and would involve the faith-
ful inheritance of ~40% or fewer of old nucleosomes every time that
region is replicated. In contrast, the template model could apply at a
single nucleosome level for H3.3, where old H3.3 mixes with new H3.3
to form single nucleosomes at least 20% of the time in bulk. The pos-
sibility of such inheritance is highlighted by the fact that the mixing of
old and new H3.3 occurs at cell type–specific enhancers (37) and that
H3.3 is enriched at PREs relative to surrounding regions (68).

The conservative inheritance of H3, together with the high prob-
ability that old histones with modifications would be lost at short
segments, argues against the simplest version of the template-binding
model for short regulatory sequences. In contrast, the constitutive mod-
el is not affected by any of the constraints of the replication-coupled
histone transfer process, because all H3s, but no H3.3s, will be modified.
The bridging model remains an attractive possibility that is not mutu-
ally exclusive with the constitutive model, insofar as recruitment of
PRC1 is known not to depend on H3K27 methylation (69, 70).

CONCLUSION

We have described the diverse cellular strategies that are observed in the
reconstitution of the steady-state nucleosome landscape after disrup-
tion and dilution of old nucleosomes during replication. In organisms
with large and complex genomes, where a particular cell type requires
that only a fraction of the genome is active, there needs to be a means
of packaging and repressing the inactive majority of the genome during
every cell division. To accomplish this feat during the brief passage of the
replication fork, a choreographed process has evolved around replication-
coupled assembly to propagate the silent state. This involves clusters of
replication-coupled histone genes that are highly transcribed only dur-
ing S phase, stem-loop binding protein, which protects the 3′ ends of
histone mRNAs from cleavage and polyadenylation to channel histone

mRNA into the specialized U7 SNURP RNA 3′-end processing ma-
chinery, and a dedicated replication-coupled nucleosome assembly
pathway (71, 72). Outside of replication, nucleosome assembly relies
on the replication-independent H3.3 variant, which is incorporated
when nucleosomes are lost due to either active processes or the in-
ability of the underlying DNA to stably wrap nucleosomes. Yeast lacks
H3K27 methylation, and the H3 variant is absent, so that a single
H3.3-like variant has become the substrate for both replication-coupled
and replication-independent pathways.

Apart from an inherent tendency of replication-coupled assembly
to impose basal silencing, inheritance of posttranslationally modified
histones at silent domains could play additional roles in maintenance
of silent states. However, as we have discussed above, inheritance of old
H3 alone is sufficiently reliable only for large chromatin domains (tens
of kilobases) due to the histones being randomly transferred to daugh-
ter chromosomes during replication. Alternatively, by splitting H3.3-
containing nucleosomes, inheritance of old H3.3 could be sufficient
to maintain chromatin states at short regulatory sequences through
replication. We anticipate that future research will focus on the extent
of inheritance of old H3 required for stable maintenance of epigenetic
states and the molecular mechanisms involved in inheritance of his-
tone modifications when nucleosomes with one old H3.3 and one new
H3.3 are formed.
