␣oscillations (8 –14 Hz) greatly influence brain activity, yet we generally do not experience them consciously: the world does not appear
to oscillate. Dedicated strategies must exist in the brain to prevent these oscillations from disrupting normal processing. Could suitable
stimuli fool these strategies and lead to the conscious experience of our own brain oscillations? We describe and explore a novel illusion
in which the center of a static wheel stimulus (with 30 – 40 spokes) is experienced as flickering when viewed in the visual periphery. The
key feature of this illusion is that the stimulus fluctuations are experienced as a regular and consistent flicker, which our human observers
estimated at ⬃9 Hz during a psychophysical matching task. Correspondingly, the occipital ␣rhythm of the EEG was the only oscillation
that showed a time course compatible with the reported illusion: when ␣amplitude was strong, the probability of reporting illusory
flicker increased. The peak oscillatory frequency for these flicker-induced modulations was significantly correlated, on a subject-by-
subject basis, with the individual ␣frequency measured during rest, in the absence of visual stimulation. Finally, although the effect is
strongest during eye movements, we showed that stimulus motion relative to the retina is not necessary to perceive the illusion: the flicker
can also be perceived on the afterimage of the wheel, yet by definition this afterimage is stationary on the retina. We conclude that this new
flickering illusion is a unique way to experience the ␣rhythms that constantly occur in the brain but normally remain unnoticed.

Introduction
Neuronal oscillations, such as the ␣rhythm (Berger, 1929) (8 –14
Hz), pervade the brain and influence sensory processing (Makeig
et al., 2002; Thut et al., 2006; Hanslmayr et al., 2007; van Dijk et
al., 2008). In particular, recent findings showed that visual process-
ing is more efficient at certain phases of the ongoing ␣rhythm than
others (Busch et al., 2009; Mathewson et al., 2009; Busch and Van-
Rullen, 2010; Dugue´ et al., 2011; Scheeringa et al., 2011). It is surpris-
ing to realize, therefore, that the sensory outcome itself is unaffected:
we do not perceive the world as oscillating. The brain must have
developed strategies to conceal the consequences of oscillations from
our perception. For instance, the brain could rely on one or more of
the following mechanisms: (1) conscious experience may arise from
brain regions far removed from those where ␣ is produced and
found to influence sensory processing; (2) attention, a major factor
in the selection of information for awareness, is known to decrease
the amplitude of ␣oscillations (Worden et al., 2000; Thut et al., 2006;
Klimesch et al., 2007), thereby dampening their potential perceptual
consequences; and (3) finally, one could envision that any recurring
“temporal gaps” in perception produced by the periodic pulses of ␣

inhibition (Jensen and Mazaheri, 2010) could be actively “filled in”
using immediately preceding and/or following visual information to
even out our conscious perceptual experience (similarly to the
filling-in of the blind spot in early representations of visual space).
Regardless of which of these (or other) strategies is actually used by
the brain to conceal perceptual effects of ␣rhythms, it is tempting to
ask whether suitable stimuli could fool these strategies and lead to the
conscious experience of our own brain oscillations.

Here we report on a novel illusion in which the center of a sta-
tionary wheel made up of ⬃30–40 spokes appears to flicker vividly
and regularly (Fig. 1). The flicker occurs most strongly during small
eye movements performed with the stimulus in the periphery. How-
ever, we show that stimulus motion relative to the retina is not cru-
cial to perceive the illusory flicker: flicker can also be experienced on
the afterimage of the stimulus; yet by definition, this afterimage is
stationary on the retina. Using psychophysics, we demonstrate that
the illusory flicker frequency peaks within the ␣range (⬃9 Hz). To
address the neuronal basis of the illusion, we recorded EEG while
observers (N ⫽ 20) performed smooth pursuit eye movements, fol-
lowing with their gaze a slowly rotating dot around the stationary
wheel. The flicker illusion was maximal for specific eye positions
around the wheel. The only EEG frequency band that displayed a
compatible time course was the ␣rhythm (8–14 Hz) over occipital
electrodes: an increased ␣magnitude specifically coincided with
the occurrence of illusory flicker. Furthermore, the frequency
that was maximally modulated during illusory perception was
significantly correlated with the individual ␣ frequency on a
subject-by-subject basis. We conclude that this new flickering
illusion represents a unique way to consciously experience the
brain’s ongoing ␣rhythm.

Behavioral data analysis. Behavioral data were analyzed using a one-
way ANOVA for the matching task and a circular r test: Raleigh test for
circular uniformity; circular statistics toolbox from MATLAB (Berens,
2009) for the smooth pursuit task.

EEG data acquisition and analysis. EEG and EOG were recorded at
1024 Hz using a Biosemi system (64 active and 3 ocular electrodes) and
downsampled offline to 128 Hz for data analysis via the MATLAB tool-
box, eeglab (Delorme and Makeig, 2004). Individual electrode data were
visually inspected, and channel data containing artifacts were interpo-
lated by the mean of adjacent electrodes. Time-frequency transforma-
tions were generated over all channels using eeglab (Delorme and
Makeig, 2004) with a function akin to a wavelet transform, starting with
3 cycles at 2 Hz and increasing linearly to 37.5 cycles at 50 Hz. To deter-
mine which oscillatory bands contributed to changes in brain activity
during the perception of illusory flicker (smooth pursuit paradigm, illu-
sory condition), a Fourier transform was performed on the amplitude
envelope of the time-frequency transformed signals, separately for each
frequency (which were then grouped into standard EEG frequency
bands: ␦, ␪, ␣, ␤, ␥). The resulting Fourier spectral amplitude at the
frequency of revolution of the eyes around the wheel (0.067 Hz) was
normalized by the amplitudes at surrounding frequencies (from 0 to
0.133 Hz, excluding the eye revolution frequency itself), revealing for
each oscillatory band the amount of amplitude modulation by eye posi-
tion (and, thus, by illusory flicker). The same procedure was also applied
to EEG data of the control condition. To compare amplitude modula-
tions during illusory and control conditions, we used a two-tailed paired
t test (␣level ⫽ 0.05). The time course of the amplitude modulation for
illusory and control conditions was also analyzed for electrodes within a
specific ROI (see Fig. 3E, green). Trials were epoched, each epoch corre-
sponding to one revolution of the fixation dot around the wheel (i.e.,
15 s); these epochs were aligned so as to be centered on the eye position of
maximal flicker perception (averaged over all subjects).

To evaluate whether the frequency band modulated during illusory
perception was correlated to the individual ␣ rhythm, we first deter-
mined, for each subject, the peak modulation frequency of these time-
frequency representations (we applied a fast Fourier transform on the
time dimension and used the first frequency component as a measure of
illusory modulation, then extracted the peak frequency of the resulting
amplitude spectrum). Fourteen of 20 subjects provided a clear individual
peak frequency for these flicker-induced modulations (amplitude was
1.5 times as high as the amplitude at surrounding frequencies: 5–15 Hz).
To determine the individual ␣ frequency of each subject, we analyzed
EEG data recorded during rest (eyes opened, data recorded from elec-
trode Oz; epochs of variable duration from 3 to 60 s). Data were down-
sampled to 256 Hz, visually inspected for artifacts, and bandpass filtered
between 0.3 Hz and 30 Hz. Power spectra were computed using Welch’s
modified periodogram method in MATLAB (Welch, 1967); we extracted
the peak in the ␣frequency band (8 –14 Hz), retaining only peak ampli-
tudes that were at least 1.5 times as high as the average amplitude at
surrounding frequencies (5–15 Hz). Ten of the previously retained 14
subjects yielded an exploitable individual ␣peak frequency.

Eye tracker data acquisition and analysis. To precisely control eye
movements during the smooth pursuit task, we performed a control
experiment with a subgroup (N ⫽ 3) of our subjects where we simulta-
neously recorded EEG and eye movements using an eye tracker (IView
Hi-Speed eye tracker; SensoMotoric Instruments). Participants were
performing the same smooth pursuit task as explained above. Eye posi-
tion data were recorded at 1250 Hz and downsampled offline to 128 Hz
for data analysis. Data were then analyzed for artifacts and eye move-
ments that exceeded a fixed limit: all data points that reflected eye posi-
tions deviating ⬎3 degrees of visual angle from the fixation dot were
flagged for rejection. Finally, we repeated the previously described EEG
time-frequency analysis for these subjects after rejecting from our EEG
data the correspondingly flagged time points.
Results
Psychophysical measurements
Our first experiment examined the influence of various psycho-
physical parameters on the perception of the illusion. We used

Figure 1.
The flickering wheel illusion. The static wheel stimulus produces an impression of
flicker when it is observed in the visual periphery. Small eye movements, as when reading these
lines, can enhance the illusory effect. The flicker can also be perceived in the afterimage of the
stimulus. To experience this, after fixating the top-left black dot for ⬃10 s, switch your gaze to
the lower dot: an impression of flicker should be fleetingly present within the wheel’s afterim-
age on the right.

Materials and Methods
Subjects. Ten volunteers (3 female, mean age 29.2 ⫾ 4.8 years) partici-
pated in the psychophysical experiment and 21 (6 female; mean age
26.2 ⫾ 4.0 years; one left handed) in the EEG experiment. All subjects
showed normal or corrected to normal eye function. One participant was
excluded from the psychophysical experiment because his mean reported
flicker intensity was ⬎2 SDs away from the group average and one sub-
ject was excluded from the EEG experiment because ⬎50% of the EEG
data contained artifacts.

Stimuli. Stimuli were presented at 57 cm distance using a desktop com-
puter (2.09 GHz Intel processor, Windows XP) with a cathode ray monitor
(resolution: 800 ⫻ 600 pixels; refresh rate: 100 Hz) on a gray background
(luminance: 11.5 cd/m 2). Stimuli were designed and presented via the Psy-
chophysics Toolbox (Brainard, 1997) running in MATLAB (MathWorks).
For the matching task, the wheel stimuli (radius: 5 degrees of visual angle)
were presented with different contrast levels (20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and
100% Michelson contrast using uncorrected CRT ␥values, corresponding to
Michelson luminance contrast of 39%, 65%, 81%, 92%, and 96%, respec-
tively) and spatial frequencies with 8, 16, 32, or 64 dark and bright alternating
spokes. In the EEG smooth pursuit task, the fixation dot revolved (15 s/rev-
olution) at 13 degrees from the wheel center. For the EEG smooth pursuit
and the afterimage tasks, stimuli (radius: 7 degrees of visual angle) of the
illusory condition were adjusted for optimal flicker perception (100% con-
trast and 32 spoke sectors), whereas stimuli of the control condition showed
a different spatial frequency (8 spoke sectors) and did not lead to illusory
perception. The 32 spoke wheels had a lower spatial frequency cutoff of 0.73
cycles per degree at their outer edge, this value increasing to infinity toward
the wheel center.

different spatial frequencies (8, 16, 32, and
64 spoke sectors) and contrast
levels
(20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% con-
trast) of the stimulus pattern, and also
tested whether binocular vision is needed
to perceive the illusion. Participants (N ⫽
9) followed a moving fixation dot by mak-
ing small successive saccades from left to
right along the horizontal midline of the
screen.

Meanwhile, in one part of the screen (8
degrees above or below the horizontal
midline), a static wheel stimulus (“test”
stimulus, 5 degrees radius) was continu-
ously presented. On the opposite side of
the screen (below or above fixation) was a
comparison stimulus (“reference”) com-
prising a circular pattern (same size as the
“test”) textured with a black-and-white
checkerboard, whose center flickered reg-
ularly; the flicker, created by superimpos-
ing a gray Gaussian window (SD 2.3
degrees) onto the stimulus center and si-
nusoidally modulating its opacity, was ad-
justable both in temporal frequency and
intensity (i.e., opacity) via button presses.
Participants were instructed to match the
frequency and intensity of the artificial
flicker in the reference stimulus with the
illusory flicker (if any) perceived in the
test stimulus. We found the greatest illu-
sory effect for a stimulus pattern built up
of 32 spoke sectors (Fig. 2A; one-way

contrast wheels led to significantly stronger illusion than 20%).
Furthermore, the magnitude of the illusion was comparable
whether the wheel was viewed with one or both eyes (Fig. 2C;
⫽ 0.09, p ⬎ 0.05). Finally, the average
one-way ANOVA, F(2,21)
flicker frequency reported by the participants was 9.1 ⫾ 0.38 Hz
(mean ⫾ SEM; Fig. 2D). According to these psychophysical re-
sults, we used a 32 spoke wheel with maximal contrast in the
following experiments.

EEG ␣oscillations correlate with illusory flicker
To investigate the neural correlates of illusory flicker, we re-
corded EEG continuously while observers performed smooth
pursuit eye movements around the centered wheel stimulus (ra-
dius: 7 degrees of visual angle; Fig. 3A). The same procedure was
also applied using a control stimulus that did not produce illu-
sory flicker (Fig. 3B). We did not use saccadic eye movements in
this case because they tend to generate large-scale EEG artifacts.
Each trial lasted 2 min, during which the ocular pursuit target
revolved around the wheel 8 times (revolution duration: 15 s).
Subjects (N ⫽ 20) reported illusory flicker perception at any
moment during the trial by pressing (at flicker onset) and releas-
ing (at flicker offset) a button. The average probability of report-
ing flicker (in the “illusory” condition) was significantly higher
for eye positions in the upper left quadrant of the screen (Fig. 3C;
Rayleigh test for circular uniformity: p ⬍ 10 ⫺6). This nonuni-
form distribution of illusory percepts suggested the following

illusion (Fig. 3D): separately for each of the classical EEG fre-
quency bands (␦⫽ 2– 4 Hz, ␪ ⫽ 4 – 8 Hz, ␣ ⫽ 8 –14 Hz, ␤ ⫽
14 –30 Hz, and ␥⫽ 30 –50 Hz), the amplitude envelope of oscil-
latory signals was extracted by means of a wavelet-based time-
frequency transform; this envelope was then subjected to a
Fourier transform to derive its amplitude spectrum. We reasoned
that any oscillatory signal reflecting the perception of illusory
flicker would display a peak in this amplitude spectrum at the
revolution frequency of the eye (i.e., 1/15 cycles per second). The
peak in the amplitude spectrum was measured as the percentage
⫽ 0.067 Hz) with
increase at the eye revolution frequency (fR
respect to an average of surrounding frequencies (from 0 to 0.133
Hz, excluding the eye revolution frequency itself). The ␣ band
displayed a clear response peak (⬃100% increase) over occipital
electrodes during the illusory condition (Fig. 3E); this peak was
much decreased in the control condition (Fig. 3F), so that the
difference between the two conditions was highly significant over
occipital electrodes (Fig. 3G; two-tailed paired t test, p ⬍ 0.0001).
The occipital topography, along with the absence of a response
peak over frontal and ocular electrodes, suggests that the ob-
served ␣modulation is truly related to the perception of flicker,
rather than to the movements of the eyes.

In contrast, there was no measurable occipital response in
other frequency bands (␦, ␪, ␤, and ␥). To summarize, the ␣
rhythm was the only oscillation to be reliably modulated at the
frequency of revolution of the eyes around the wheel and, thus, at
the frequency at which the flickering illusion itself tended to recur

position of the eyes around the wheel (pooled over all 20 subjects). There was a significant tendency to perceive stronger illusory flicker at upper left positions: p ⬍ 10 ⫺6 (Rayleigh test for circular
uniformity). D, Our analysis procedure is illustrated here with hypothetical data. As the eyes revolve around the wheel every 15 s, the perception of flicker rises and falls in each revolution (as
demonstrated inC). We hypothesized that the relevant brain activity (e.g., the amplitude of a specific brain oscillation) would show a similar pattern with an increase once per revolution. In that case,
a fast Fourier transform analysis would reveal a peak in the signal’s power spectrum at the eye revolution frequency (1/15 s ⫽ 0.067 Hz). The amplitude value at that frequency (fR, marked in yellow)
was compared with the surrounding frequencies (fS, marked in green) to reveal the percentage of signal modulation by angular eye position: Mod ⫽ 100*(fR

by angular eye position. The analysis described in D was applied to the time course of fluctuations of oscillatory amplitude in the ␣band. The strong modulation over occipital electrodes
suggests that occipital ␣amplitude changes systematically as a function of eye position, and thus as a function of flicker perception. F, The same analysis reveals weaker modulations for
the control stimulus. G, Direct contrast between illusory and control conditions (two-tailed paired t test) reveals highly significant differences ( p ⬍ 0.0001) of ␣modulation over

during each trial. A similar conclusion was reached by observing
the time-frequency representation of occipital EEG activity (Fig.
3E, electrodes of interest marked in green) during the course of an
averaged 15 s smooth pursuit revolution epoch (Fig. 4).

For increased readability, we aligned the epoch so that it was
centered on the eye position that maximized the illusory flicker
(averaged over all subjects). Not only was ␣ the only reliably
modulated frequency, but its modulation was also positively re-
lated to the flicker illusion: the likelihood of perceived flicker
increased when ␣amplitude was high and decreased when it was
low. We compared on a subject-by-subject basis the frequency of
maximal modulation by the illusory flicker with the individual ␣
frequency (measured during rest, in the absence of visual stimu-
lation; see Materials and Methods). Over the group of 10 subjects
for whom we could reliably determine both the individual ␣
frequency and the individual frequency of maximal modula-
tion by the illusory flicker, we found a strongly significant corre-

lation between the two measures (p ⫽ 0.004, r ⫽ 0.813). In
conclusion, the ␣ rhythm appears to be the sole viable neural
correlate of the flickering wheel illusion.

In a control experiment performed by a subgroup of subjects
(N ⫽ 3), we repeated the smooth pursuit task while recording eye
movements using an eye tracker. This was done to ensure that
participants were effectively pursuing the fixation dot with their
gaze. After rejecting epochs of EEG data showing high deviations
of eye position from the fixation dot (⬎3 degrees visual angle), we
repeated the EEG time-frequency analysis as above. The time-
frequency decomposition in Figure 5 shows results highly com-
patible with those of the original experiment: ␣ activity was
positively related to the perceived illusory flicker.

Is retinal motion of the wheel necessary?
Finally, we tested the role of any eye movements in the generation of
the illusion: is the displacement of the stimulus pattern on the retina

13502 • J. Neurosci., August 14, 2013 • 33(33):13498 –13504

a necessary condition for flicker perception,
or could the eye movements serve a more
indirect role, for example, by enhancing or
phase-resetting the ␣ rhythm (Mulholland
and Evans, 1965; Dewan, 1967; Fenwick and
Walker, 1968; Fourment et al., 1976) that
subsequently produces illusory flicker? Fig-
ure 1 illustrates that the flicker can also be
experienced in the afterimage of the wheel
stimulus; because the afterimage is, by defi-
nition, stabilized on the retina, this observa-
tion would tend to favor the second
alternative. We tested this observation sys-
tematically on all 20 participants. They were
asked to fixate the center of the screen. To
the left or right of fixation (eccentricity: 10
degrees of visual angle), a wheel stimulus
(radius: 7 degrees of visual angle) was pre-
sented for a fixed 6 s interval, so as to ensure
adaptation; then the wheel disappeared, and
another wheel simultaneously reappeared
on the other side of fixation for another 6 s
period, and so on. In each period, partici-
pants were instructed to pay attention to the
afterimage (i.e., the side where the wheel
had just disappeared) and report illusory
flicker perception via button press (pressing
when the illusion started, and releasing
when it stopped). Flicker could be reported
either on the side of the afterimage or on the
side of the physically present stimulus (or
both; two separate response buttons were
provided). Two-thirds of the trials were per-
formed with the illusory and one-third with
the control stimulus (Fig. 3A,B). A total of
82.5 ⫾ 5.0% (mean ⫾ SEM) of all illusory
trials showed responses to flicker perception
in the afterimage (flicker perception pe-
riod ⱖ 100 ms). The control stimulus did
not lead to illusory perception.

To summarize, the frequent perception
of illusory flicker in the wheel’s afterimage
implies that displacements of the wheel on
the retina are not strictly necessary to pro-
duce the illusion. This finding thus rules out
eye movements (e.g., saccades and micro-
saccades) as a direct cause of the illusion, as
well as any direct contribution from accom-
modation fluctuations
(Alpern, 1958;
Campbell et al., 1959; Kotulak and Schor,
1986; Winn and Gilmartin, 1992; Gray et al.,
1993), small changes of the shape of the lens
that distort the retinal image. This does not
preclude, however, an indirect role for eye
movements (or accommodation responses)
in the flickering effect (e.g., by modulating
the phase or amplitude of ␣rhythms in such
a way that would eventually result in the
perception of illusory flicker).

Discussion
Several other illusory effects have been de-
scribed previously where a static pattern

(Pirenne et al., 1958; Gregory, 1993; Troncoso et al., 2008), often
under the influence of eye movements or accommodation fluc-
tuations, appears to undergo dynamic changes. For example, our
stimulus is a modified version of the well-known “Mackay rays”
pattern, a wheel with ⬃100 –200 spokes that has been reported to
produce slowly drifting and rotating illusory circles in its after-
image (MacKay, 1957). Other examples include Leviant’s
“Enigma” figure (Leviant, 1996; Kumar and Glaser, 2006; Tron-
coso et al., 2008) (based on Mackay rays), the scintillating luster
illusion (Pinna et al., 2002) and the pursuit-pursuing illusion
(Ito, 2012) (both based on Ehrenstein figures), the peripheral
drift illusion (Fraser and Wilcox, 1979; Faubert and Herbert,
1999), the scintillating grid (Schrauf et al., 1997; VanRullen and
Dong, 2003) (based on the Hermann grid), or the Ouchi illusion
(Hine et al., 1997; Khang and Essock, 1997). Although it is likely
that our flickering wheel illusion is related to one or more of these
well-known effects and could thus share the same neuronal basis,
what sets our illusion apart is the regular and cyclic (“flickering”)
nature of the percept. This unique feature gave us the possibility
to explore potential oscillatory correlates of the effect, which we
identified in the ␣band.

In the perceptual matching task, participants estimated the
flicker frequency in the ␣ band (⬃9 Hz; Fig. 2D). However, the
distribution of reported frequencies was rather broad, with many
reports occurring at lower frequencies (e.g., in the ␪ band, 4 – 8
Hz). We think that this may be explained by the intrinsic diffi-
culty of the perceptual matching task. For example, previous
studies have shown a general tendency for observers to underes-
timate perceived temporal frequency in the visual periphery (Yo
and Wilson, 1993).

In the smooth pursuit task, EEG correlates of illusory flicker
were again observed in the ␣band (Figs. 4 and 5). The peak of ␣
activity, however, was not in perfect temporal alignment with the
maximal strength of the illusion but occurred 1–2 s earlier. At
least two factors may contribute to this temporal lag. First, the
perception of the illusion could not be instantaneously reported
by the participants because of the latency in the motor response;
in addition, participants may have responded conservatively and
waited before reporting a flicker percept (or its disappearance)
when they were not fully confident in their perception. Second,
one could also envision that illusory flicker may only become
consciously visible after a minimal integration period of high ␣
power has occurred; our results would then indicate that this
integration period is on the order of 1–2 s.

Is the ␣rhythm the source or merely the consequence of the
perceptual flicker, or is it both? The presence of similar, albeit
weaker, ␣ fluctuations when the smooth pursuit task is per-
formed around a control stimulus that produces no illusion
(Fig. 3F ) indicates that these fluctuations can occur indepen-
dently of the flicker (Mulholland and Evans, 1965; Dewan,
1967; Fenwick and Walker, 1968): they are not merely a con-
sequence of the illusion. On the other hand, the increase of
said ␣ fluctuations when viewing the illusory stimulus (Figs.
3E, 4, and 5), together with the fact that our observers consis-
tently placed the frequency of perceived flicker within the ␣
band (Fig. 2D), suggests that the flicker illusion could “rever-
berate” and thereby enhance the existing ␣oscillations, much
in the same way as a physically flickering stimulus ⬃10 Hz
evokes a steady-state response at the same frequency (Regan,
1966; Herrmann, 2001). Therefore, we speculate that ␣ band
oscillations are both a cause and a consequence of illusory
flicker: they are necessary for flicker to arise (but certainly not
sufficient; an appropriate stimulus pattern is also required),

and they are also enhanced by this perceived flicker through
reverberation mechanisms
(VanRullen and Macdonald,
2012).

Not every geometric stimulus pattern can resonate with ␣
oscillations and induce an oscillatory perception; this effect
seems to be limited to sunburst or wheel patterns within a precise
range of radial frequencies (between 30 and 40 spokes; Fig. 2A).
What could be the relation specifically linking this type of geo-
metric pattern to ␣oscillations? Interestingly, there are previous
reports of visual hallucinations resembling geometric radial fig-
ures that can be induced by stroboscopic visual stimulation (i.e.,
an actual flicker) at a frequency ⬃10 Hz (Shevelev et al., 2000; ter
Meulen et al., 2009). The underlying mechanisms are little un-
derstood (Rule et al., 2011) but could rely on a correspondence
between the spatial organization of visual cortex (retinotopy, cor-
tical magnification, lateral connections) and the temporal dy-
namics of neuronal information propagation (neuronal time
constants, conduction delays). A similar logic may be applied to
explain the enhancement of ␣oscillatory activity upon presenta-
tion of our geometric stimulus pattern. Once this ␣ activity
reaches a critical threshold, the rapid alternation of favorable and
less favorable phases for sensory processing (Busch et al., 2009;
Mathewson et al., 2009) produces a “pulsed-inhibition” (Jensen
and Mazaheri, 2010) that can become visible as a regular flicker in
the center of the wheel.

Although the precise mechanisms linking the spatial wheel
pattern to the temporal fluctuations at ⬃10 Hz still remain to be
elucidated, our report clearly implies that the illusion is a phe-
nomenological counterpart of the ␣ rhythm. ␣ oscillations are
constantly in your brain, affecting the way it processes visual
inputs, but, unless you are a frequent LSD user (Dubois and
VanRullen, 2011), you never consciously noticed them— until
now.
