Exercise 1

The Role of Research in Psychology, Part IV: The problems of generalisation and decision-making in
research: Chance findings and sample size

• Overview

◦ In psychology: Generalisation because striving for universalism

▪ BUT: How to draw the limits to whether a finding is universal/can be replicated or was just

a matter of chance?! → sampling procedures and statistical significance

◦ Psychological research is concerned with samples of people rather than with individuals

◦ Problem with sample population: usually just most convenient population (e.g. Psy students) →

no random sampling from specified population (sample population biased)

◦ generalisation: universalism = assumption that behavioral effects found in experiments are the

same for all people → “no need for ensuring that sample is representative”

▪ → overgeneralization?!

◦ statistical analysis = “how safe” is it to generalize from a given sample data set to all people?

◦ General  procedure:  Assume that the H0 was true and then comparing found data to effect

claimed by H0

◦ With an alpha = 5  percent:  the  probability of a finding being due to chance when the null
hypothesis is in fact true is 5 times out of 100, or less. Results that meet this criterion are called
statistically significant, otherwise they are statistically non-significant

◦ sample size is important (the bigger → the more likely that statistically significant)

•

Introduction

◦ Are we justified to make more general claims about findings of our research beyond research

itself?

◦ Three themes:

▪ lack of limitations placed on generalisation by the universalism of psychological theory.

▪ limitations placed on generalisation by the sampling methods used.

▪ limitations placed on generalisation by the structures of statistical significance testing.

◦ issues such as the generalisability of data are really aspects of process of decision-making that a

researcher makes throughout their research

• Universalism

◦ characteristic of psychology: tendency towards universalism

◦ universalism: The principles of psychology will not vary; psychological findings will apply
anywhere to anybody irrespective of social status, culture... → finding is true of all people
(there are exceptions: in rare cases, it's implied that findings are only for a certain population)
“psychological principles = laws of human nature”

◦ historically: also generalisation from animals to humans (Pavlov, Skinner)

◦ only recently: critique on universalism

◦ Nowadays: psychologists likely to be aware of the problem but, nevertheless, this awareness is
not built into their practices for designing their research studies: Universalism operates covertly

•

Sampling and generalisation

◦ Many   criticisms   have   been   made   of   psychology   for   its   restricted   approach   to   sampling

(“psychological research = psychology of psychology students”)

◦ How big should a sample be to allow for generalisability?

◦ How should samples be selected in order to allow for generalisability?

◦ There is a variability (differences between people and within people) between all individuals:

→ need for statistics and sampling designs

◦ sample size partially dependent on possible consequences of research 

◦ larger samples are more likely to demonstrate a trend in the study if there is one in reality →

psychologists believe that this is likely to result in greater precision in their estimates

◦ sample size depends on whether we simply want to find if two parameters correlate/have a

relationship or if we want to find the exact/”true” size of that relationship

◦ convenience samples = not random samples of groups of people that are relatively easy for the

researcher to get to take part in their study
▪ most find this acceptable for majority of psychological research
▪ but some argue that this procedure is presumptious

◦ universalism = psychologist's tendency to generalise beyond the population which would be

defined by the research sample.
▪ At what time should generalisation stop?!
▪ distinction between the  

 population of interest  
 

 
sample of participants

 and the population defined clearly by the

▪ appropriateness of sampling methods?!

◦ randomisation is used it is in the form of random allocation to the conditions of an experiment

or the sequence of taking part in the conditions BUT not for random sampling

◦ Random sampling is considerably undermined by poor participation rates (Participation rates refer to

the proportion of people who take part in the research compared with the number asked to take part in the research)

◦ Systematic errors!!! by unappropriate sampling methods/not random samples

•

Statistics and generalisation

◦ Statistical techniques help researchers explore patterns in their data

◦ A statistically significant finding is one that is large enough that it is unlikely to be caused by

chance fluctuations/noise

◦ convention: alpha = 5 percent level : finding as big as ours can be expected to occur by chance
on 5 or fewer occasions if we tested that finding on 100 occasions (assuming that the null
hypothesis is in fact true)

◦ A finding or effect that is likely to occur on more than 5 out of 100 times by chance is described

as being statistically non-significant or not statistically significant

◦ Statistical significance testing merely refers to the question whether the trend is sufficiently
large in the data so that it is unlikely that it could be the result of chance factors due to the
variability inherent in sampling, that is, there is little chance that the null hypothesis of no trend
or difference is correct

◦ larger sample → higher probability to get significant results (very few H0 are true when dealing

with large samples)

◦ the critical value of 5 per cent or .05 or less is an arbitrary cut-off point, BUT nevertheless one

widely accepted
