“It’s all about persons. As much as you know persons, 
they could serve you, they could employ you in the 
position that they like. […] As soon as I do have an 
important relative or an important person I know. And 
he is a friend of mine. He could put me in anywhere. 
[…] Maybe you are more qualified than me. As (soon)

as I know an important person here, I could get 
something better than you.” 
Interview #15

“For example, the son of a minister would get hired 
anywhere with the highest salary even if the 
organization doesn't need him just because he's the 
minister's son. Even if his dad wasn't a minister you 
look at the family or tribe name, you know? Based on 
the family or tribe name or the father's job […] (the 
the family or tribe name or the father's job […] (the 
son) gets hired as a fresh graduate with 2000 or 3000 
JDs. 
Or for example, a boss' daughter got out of university 
in Britain or America. Only because she's his daughter 
they'll hire her as a consultant in a ministry for 3000 
JDs and she doesn't even go to work”  
Interview #17

„Of course it is not just, I mean like I told you, justice is
that everyone gets what they deserve but I mean if
someone took someone else‘s place in line, no no
there is no justice. And you can see that there is no
justice. […] my opinion on justice is that a person takes
justice. […] my opinion on justice is that a person takes
what they deserve without wronging anyone else, I 
consider this justice.“

Interview #18 

„Justice in the workplace […] is about putting the
suitable person in the suitable position. And give
everybody the thing that he deserves in his work. As 
much as he work, as much as you get.“ 

Interview #15

Wasta vs. Equity

• „Intercessory wasta involves a protagonist intervening

on behalf of a client to obtain an advantage for the
client“  (Cunningham & Sarayrah, 1994)

• „Equity  is  said  to  occur  when  Person  perceives  that  

the  ratio  of  his outcomes  to  his  inputs  is  equal  to  
Other's  outcome/input  ratio.  Conversely,  Person  
experiences  inequity  when  he  perceives  that  his  
ratio  is not  equal  to  Other's.” (Pritchard, 1969)
