Intelligence

“Intelligence is what the tests test.” E.G. Boring

“Intelligence is a very general capability that, among other thing, involves the ability to 

reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly and 
learn from experience. It is not merely book learning, a narrow academic skill, or test-taking 

(52 prominent researchers)

smarts. Rather, it reflects a broader and deeper capability for comprehending our 
surroundings - ‘catching on’, ‘making sense’ of things, or ‘figuring out’ what to do. 

Intelligence, can be measured, and intelligence tests measure it well.”

Outline
● Neural Correlates of Intelligence: “The neuroscience of human intelligence 

differences”, Deary et al. 2010

● G- factor

● Emotional Intelligence

● Intelligence Tests (Raven’s Matrices, ZVT) 

● Discussion

Summary/Findings

- General intelligence gives a basis for predicting occupation, health, age etc.

-

Intelligence is heritable:

- Genetic influence on intelligence increases with age
- Genetics directly influence brain structure

- Brain structure:

- Modest, positive correlation with head/brain size
-
-
- Basis for correlations not fully understood

Small difference between correlations with grey/white matter (gender differences)
Intelligence correlates with cortical thickness (prefrontal cortex, temporal lobes)

Summary/Findings

- Brain efficiency:

Intelligent people process and react to sensory input faster

-
- Higher “neuronal efficiency” for intelligent people
- Less brain resources needed for cognitive tasks
- Relevant brain areas less active during resting periods

- Distributed network perspective:

Intelligence relies on a network of brain regions, rather than one particular region

-
- Many different ways of achieving similar performance (gender differences)
-

“The brains of some people are more efficient than those of others.”

P-FIT

parieto - frontal integration 
theory of intelligence 

“P-FIT is the best available 
description of how 
intelligence is distributed in 
the brain.” Jung and Haier

g - factor

What is possible criticism? 

In differential 
psychology 
‘General 
Intelligence’ = ‘g’  
describes positive 
correlations to 
similar degree of 
cognitive domains 
such as:

reasoning, 
processing speed, 
executive function, 
memory and 
spatial ability

Tests

Raven’s Progressive Matrices Test

Number - Connection - Test

● Do you feel that this test is representative for your intelligence? 

● Is intelligence not far too complex to be represented by a single 

number? 

● What conclusions can we draw from a single test?
