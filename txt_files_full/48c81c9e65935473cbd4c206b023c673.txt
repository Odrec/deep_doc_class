University Rankings 
in Critical Perspective

This article addresses global postsecondary ranking systems by using critical-theoretical 
perspectives on power. This research suggests rankings are at once a useful lens for study-
ing power in higher education and an important instrument for the exercise of power in 
service of dominant norms in global higher education.

this article addresses two issues that are rarely linked in research on 
higher education, global rankings and power. we have argued elsewhere 
that rankings are poorly understood and that power has been neglected 
in models of postsecondary behavior.1 in this article, we use two critical 
approaches to power, Steven lukes’s three-dimensional model (1974, 
2005) and foucault’s relations of power (foucault, 1977; marginson, 
2008), to understand the nature of global university rankings and the 
implications of those rankings for postsecondary policy making.

Rankings serve as a particularly useful lens for the study of power in 
higher education, as they are used to confer prestige, in the allocation of

resources, as a form of agenda setting, as a means of stratifying national 
higher education systems, as a means of establishing hierarchical rela-
tions between nations, and as a lever to impose demands for account-
ability and normative adaptation. Furthermore, given the global fixation 
with postsecondary league tables, and the equally globalized perception 
of the importance of higher education in national and transnational eco-
nomic development, rankings offer a window into the ways in which 
power shapes the contemporary relationship between states, institutions, 
civil  society,  and  social  actors  (marginson,  2011;  pusser,  2011).  our 
fundamental finding in this article is that a close analysis of global rank-
ings  suggests  they  are  dominated  by  powerful,  intentionally-enacted 
norms and distinct interests, to the degree that perhaps the greatest util-
ity in rankings is that they can serve as significant indicators of relations 
of power and contest within states as those states provide and regulate 
higher education. while some rankings operate in the global territory 
outside states (e.g., webometrics), and many are generated by non-state 
actors, all rankings have a recognizable relationship to state agendas in 
that they can be utilized to compare the “performance” of one state sys-
tem against others and to compare institutions within nations with each 
other.

Power in Postsecondary Research

the study of postsecondary institutions has relied on a narrow and 
generally  functionalist  set  of  conceptual  frameworks.  for  more  than 
three decades, the field has been dominated by positivist and rational 
choice models (Baldridge, 1971; hammond, 2004), neo-institutionalist 
approaches (clark, 1993; dimaggio & powell, 1983; pfeffer & Salan-
cik, 1978), and new-managerialist approaches (amaral, magalhaes, & 
Santiago, 2003; kezar & lester, 2009; maassen, 2003; Reed, 2002). as 
a result, much of the literature on politics and policy in higher education 
has been decoupled from critical perspectives on the political economy 
of postsecondary institutions. a central element, power (lukes, 2005)—
drawn  from  the  critical  political  and  social  philosophies  that  have 
shaped other areas of postsecondary research—is largely absent from 
research on institutions in higher education.

the relative lack of attention to power is due, in part, to the ways in 
which scholars of higher education have borrowed theories and frame-
works from the sociology of organizations and from political science. 
In the first case, while the works of Burton Clark, Paul DiMaggio, and 
John  meyer  are  widely  cited  in  postsecondary  research,  the  work  of 
such  political  sociologists  as  weber  (1947),  Blau  (1955,  1970),  zald 

546    The Journal of Higher Education

(1970), and morrow (2006) has, until quite recently, had limited impact 
on work in higher education. the frameworks drawn from the sociology 
of organizations in general, and neo-institutionalist models in particular, 
for research in higher education have infrequently employed politics or 
power (ordorika, 2003; parsons, 1997; pusser, 2008).

it is also the case that traditional scholarship in political science has 
rarely addressed postsecondary institutions in much detail; even more 
rare is work in the discipline approaching higher education from criti-
cal frameworks or with attention to power. in the latter two decades of 
the 20th century, new research emerged that did apply positivist politi-
cal  models  to  institutions  more  generally  and,  to  a  limited  degree,  to 
schools (chubb & moe, 1990; kingdon, 1984; masten, 1995; weingast 
& marshall,  1988). much  the  same  prevails  with  regard  to  emerging 
research on higher education policy that has increasingly drawn from 
models based in political science (doyle, 2006; lane & kivisto, 2008; 
mcclendon, 2003). for the most part, this work has taken essentially 
pluralist and rational choice approaches with little attention to critical 
perspectives, the role of the state, or power (pusser, 2008).

more recently, however, a new strand of research in higher educa-
tion has emerged, one that combines critical theoretical approaches with 
work on politics and power. this critical-political approach to higher 
education  turns  attention  to  hegemony,  inequality,  ideology,  and  the 
roles of the state, civil society, and organized interests in contests over 
higher  education.  it  is  distinctively  different  from  pluralist,  interest 
group driven, or rational choice models for understanding postsecond-
ary behaviors. we note, though, that while critical work is an increas-
ingly important arena for research on such issues as postsecondary stu-
dent access and equity (lee & cantwell, 2011; Solarzano, 1998; tier-
ney, 2006), even those works that adopt a critical stance on matters of 
access rarely explicitly address power in its various manifestations.

Critical Political Theory and Power in Higher Education

By acknowledging issues related to power, critical scholars of higher 
education have been able to bring social theory and models of contest to 
bear on challenges that have persistently evaded the efforts of function-
alist researchers (martinez-aleman, in press). critical scholars have ad-
dressed such topics as the commercialization of knowledge production 
(de Sousa Santos, 2006), the limitations of market models of university 
transformation  (marginson,  1997),  academic  capitalism  (Slaughter  & 
leslie, 1997; Slaughter & Rhoades, 2004), the ascendance of neoliberal 
policy in a variety of national contexts (levin, 2007; pusser, kempner, 

University Rankings in Critical Perspective    547

marginson,  & ordorika,  2011;  valimaa,  2011),  critical  approaches  to 
power in higher education (marginson, 1997), and the role of the state 
in shaping postsecondary mission and practice (morrow, 2006; ordorika 
& pusser, 2007; Rhoads & torres, 2006; Slaughter, 1990). these works 
point  to  the  utility  of  critical  political  theories  in  the  study  of  global 
higher education.

Universities as Political Institutions

it has been argued that colleges and universities can be conceptual-
ized as political institutions of the state. we follow carnoy (1984) in de-
fining the state as the set of formal institutions—including governance 
mechanisms, the judiciary, regulatory agencies, the military, and other 
entities that serve to shape collective activity in the service of individ-
uals’ rights—that taken together establish legitimate sovereignty over 
a given area. political institutions of the state are those organizations 
that require state resources, allocate scarce state benefits, and gain their 
charter authority from the state, where all of those activities are medi-
ated by political contest and formal decision-making bodies (ordorika 
& pusser, 2007). of course, the state also has interests of its own and 
serves as a political actor and mediator (ordorika, 2003; Schumpeter, 
1942/1976)  as  well  as  representing  the  interests  of  the  nation  on  the 
global  plane.  this  suggests  that  both  public  and  private  universities 
can be considered political institutions of the state (kaul, 2008; pusser, 
2008)—and, indeed, many national jurisdictions around the world ex-
plicitly position and regulate both public and private institutions as part 
of the responsibility of the state. Both types of institutions are factors in 
key state projects, albeit often in contradictory ways (labaree, 1997). 
those contradictions are inevitable, given that the state has long been 
understood as a site of contest for hegemony (Gramsci, 1971), where 
political and intellectual interests, elements of the civil society, and so-
cial actors vie to shape ideologies and class structures (althusser, 1977; 
carnoy, 1984; friere, 2000; poulantzas, 1978). State goals for higher 
education encompass economic and social development and moderniza-
tion and the redress of inequality inherent in such development. States 
expand the capacity of higher education systems at the same time that 
elite and prestigious institutions limit enrollments to key undergradu-
ate and graduate programs, and colleges and universities play a role in 
building the state itself (ordorika & pusser, 2007). 

as political institutions, universities are driven by power. States con-
centrate power in societies and nations, and state actions constitute a 
central manifestation of power in postsecondary education. Universities 

548    The Journal of Higher Education

are also directly affected by competition between various economic and 
social interests (pusser, 2004). this includes contestation over student 
entry  and  over  the  meanings  and  effects  of  postsecondary  programs. 
while  universities  provide  space  and  shelter  for  critical  groups  and 
counter-hegemonic  agendas,  they  are  also  used—more  continuously 
and effectively—by powerful families, professions, and social groups 
to reproduce and legitimize the exercise of political, economic, social 
and cultural wealth, authority, and power from generation to generation. 
Elite universities provide credentials that are scarce and valuable. they 
are a prize that has long driven postsecondary contest. in universities, 
there are also conflicting demands on faculty priorities, demands which 
are emblematic of competing interests. for example, universities must 
apportion the balance of time between research for profit-making com-
panies and research designed to directly fulfill public health goals. The 
nexus between state, society, and university is mediated by relations of 
power. these relations shape, and in turn are shaped by, global postsec-
ondary rankings.

what drives state agendas? why do postsecondary institutions con-
form (not easily or automatically but in general and in the last analy-
sis) to those state agendas? why and how is it that research-intensive 
universities, of the type that figure in the rankings, tend to respond to 
the social and economic interests of the same powerful corporations and 
leading families that exercise a notable ongoing influence in politics, 
public debate, and the affairs of state in almost every country? this arti-
cle is focused on one technology of power in higher education—univer-
sity rankings—and will not explore in detail the social logic of power in 
and through universities, a topic deserving of an article in its own right.
We  will  briefly  note  some  of  this  work.  Gramsci  (1971)  explained 
that  in  dealing  with  national  populations,  states  work  with  two  kinds 
of mechanisms: those based on coercion and those such as educational 
institutions that are based on securing consent and the exercise of hege-
mony. on behalf of the state, educational institutions reinforce and re-
produce the leadership of the dominant social groups, including norma-
tive practices and forms of knowledge that secure their interests. Bour-
dieu’s (1988) argument concerning social and cultural capital provides 
an empirical framework for mapping manifestations of class power in 
the  university  context.  likewise althusser’s  (2001)  notion  of  “ideo-
logical state apparatuses” pinpoints the role of culture and science in 
the reproduction of social and economic power. Slaughter and Rhoades 
(2004) analyzed these issues in the context of the contemporary United 
States.  they  traced  practical  connections  between  leading  univer-
sities  and  corporate  interests  and  the  patterns  of  state  legislation  that  

University Rankings in Critical Perspective    549

enable the university’s work for capital. though not every institution of 
postsecondary education is a direct instrument of class power and state 
agendas, those institutions with the greatest resources and authority are 
most apt to reflect the dominant interests in society, notwithstanding the 
presence of critics and dissidents. it is notable that the overall frame-
works  of  postsecondary  education,  and  the  values  embodied  in  those 
frameworks, tend to reflect and reproduce the day-to-day practices of 
the leading institutions. University rankings are an especially clear em-
bodiment of these frameworks and values. it is also no coincidence that 
the  institutions  that  are  normalized  by  rankings,  and  elevated  to  the 
leading positions, are also the institutions that train most of the persons 
who occupy roles at the summit of both states and leading corporations.
in sum, our analysis of global rankings below is based on the premise 
that from a critical political perspective, rather than being technical ex-
ercises in assessment, rankings constitute and express relations of politi-
cal power, in which the particular techniques of each ranking system are 
the servant of and driven by normative agendas. in fact, some rankings 
seem to create or confirm a preordained hierarchy of institutions. The 
year 2009 saw the appearance of a Russian ranking of the world’s lead-
ing  universities,  prepared  by  the  independent  Rating agency  RatER. 
this ranking located 15 percent of the top 350 universities in Russia and 
placed  moscow  State  University  above  harvard,  Stanford,  and  cam-
bridge. other more established rankings seem to favor interests, values, 
types of institution, and/or postsecondary practices rather than attempt-
ing to prestructure the details of the ranked hierarchy itself. we begin 
the analysis of power and rankings with a closer look at power itself.

Power

power has long been a contentious subject in social and political the-
ory. perhaps such contestation, which is itself an act of power that is 
practiced by scholars with their own individual locations within rela-
tions  of  power,  becomes  an  inevitable  consequence  of  an  explicit  re-
search focus on power. indeed, there is considerable disagreement on 
how  to  define  power  (Dahl,  1961;  Lukes,  2005;  Morgan,  1997).  Fol-
lowing  Lukes  (2005),  we  draw  upon  Bertrand  Russell’s  definition  of 
power as “the production of intended effects” (1938, p. 19). We find this 
definition helpful for its emphasis on intentionality, a particularly use-
ful concept for application to higher education, an arena that has long 
relied on normative understandings of such central ideas as goals, in-
terests, and equity. The definition is also helpful because it points to the 
relational aspect of power. organizations, interests, and persons seek to  

550    The Journal of Higher Education

secure  effects  in  relation  to  other  materialities.  Furthermore,  we  find 
particularly useful weber’s (1947) notion of power as the ability of an 
actor to impose his or her will in spite of resistance as well as the sub-
sequent work based on weber from mills (1956) and parsons (1967). 
they  suggest  that  power  can  be  understood  through  its  role  in  creat-
ing structures that institutionalize processes of authority and that tend 
to further privilege elites. this structural approach enables us to create a 
distinction between normative beliefs about relations of power in higher 
education—such  as  professional  autonomy  and  the  rules,  regulations, 
and legislation that formally codify power in postsecondary organiza-
tions—and the interests served by particular configurations of power. 
the  structural  approach  also  creates  room  for  dispersed  democratic 
forms of power, collective forms, social movements, and acts of resis-
tance (at least some of which might be characterized as acts of power).
foucault (1977) argued that power was exercised not by denying in-
dividuals agency but by socializing them as actors who voluntarily op-
erate in the best interests of other, more powerful agents—a process he 
defined as a “disciplinary practice.” Relations of power did not abol-
ish the freedoms of individuals but controlled and directed those free-
doms in particular ways. at the heart of these models is a question of 
the degree to which power is contested and the ways in which individu-
als come to understand their own standpoint reflexively in relation to 
power.

Lukes’s Critique

in his “radical critique” of the understanding of power, Steven lukes 
(1986, 2005) presented a model that unfolds in three dimensions. Each 
dimension  has  utility  for  considering  the  relationship  between  power 
and global rankings. Lukes suggested the first dimension of power is the 
one most often found in classic analyses of power (dahl, 1961; weber, 
1947). it also informs much of the work on the politics of postsecond-
ary research. This first dimension is dominated by functionalist, rational 
choice and pluralist approaches to understanding power. here contest is 
essentially limited to interest group competition, where the majority of 
revealed preferences drives decision making.

lukes’s second dimension draws from Bachrach and Baratz’s (1970) 
elaboration of an advanced form of agenda control, which builds from 
Schattschneider’s  definition  of  organization  as  “the  mobilization  of 
bias” (Bachrach & Baratz, 1970, p. 8). it turns attention to the factors 
that shape contest beyond the rational choice approach and to the ways 
in which normative beliefs are created and the decision-making space 

University Rankings in Critical Perspective    551

narrowed through the exercise of power (pusser &  marginson, 2012). 
the second dimension establishes a very different perspective, moving 
from an analysis of decision making to an analysis of how the decision-
making process is controlled (lukes, 2005).

the third dimension of power in the lukes typology takes another 
conceptual  step  forward  as  it  contemplates  the  use  of  power  in  tran-
scending  the  decision-making  process  itself.  in  the  third  dimension, 
the constraints imposed by power extend to individual and collective 
imagination so that contest itself is rarely, if ever, contemplated. contest 
would call upon individuals to imagine the unimaginable and to think 
the  unthinkable,  particularly  where  those  unimagined  potentials  chal-
lenge the use of power to preserve dominant formations. Understand-
ing the third dimension calls for the analysis of the nature of ideology 
and normative beliefs themselves as a form of the exercise of power, a 
standpoint that calls into question myths, sagas, and dominant narratives 
in political, economic, and social life. we now apply lukes’s model and 
other critical insights to the topic of rankings.

Rankings in Higher Education

while rankings are not a new phenomenon in higher education (Stu-
art, 1995), they have become increasingly prominent in higher educa-
tion systems around the world over the past three decades, especially 
the  most  recent  decade.  from  initial  rankings  of  overall  institutional 
prestige to more nuanced analyses of individual departments and pro-
grams at the undergraduate, graduate, and professional levels, there is 
now a ranking system in place to cover nearly every formal system of 
postsecondary institutions in the world. Ranking systems in many na-
tional contexts have become so influential that not only do they rank 
institutional outputs, but they also shape the character and quantity of 
those outputs (Ehrenberg, 2000, 2003; kirp, 2003). Rankings thus have 
become both a representation of the relative prestige and influence of 
postsecondary institutions, particularly in the United States and china, 
and a key driver of institutional prestige and influence.

hazelkorn (2008), in a study of institutional leaders in a variety of 
countries, found that rankings were understood as essential to institu-
tional reputation and shaped virtually every aspect of institutional orga-
nization and governance. Nearly 90 percent of hazelkorn’s respondents 
had implemented strategies to improve institutional ranking, to monitor 
the performance of peer institutions, and to use rankings to set institu-
tional priorities and resource allocation. whether through their visibil-
ity in the political economy of postsecondary institutions, or because of 

552    The Journal of Higher Education

their utility in political economic contests over postsecondary policies, 
rankings have been instrumental in reshaping the core mission and func-
tions of a wide array of colleges and universities (marginson, 2007).

Applying the Model to Global Rankings

our contention here is that a framework based in theoretical under-
standings of power, particularly in the three dimensions put forward by 
Steven lukes, enables one to better understand the relationship between 
states and postsecondary rankings. we focus on three key concepts that 
underpin the application of models of power to the study of rankings: 
1) intentionality, 2) legitimacy, and 3) ideology (pusser & marginson, 
2012).

On the first point, we argue that higher education systems and institu-
tions are intentionally organized within states to produce particular out-
comes. that is, states have essential purposes that must be met through 
the provision and regulation of higher education, although those pur-
poses will vary depending on the nature of the state and its goals. Given 
the importance of assessment and accountability in contemporary post-
secondary education across national contexts, we argue that the mea-
sures in each national ranking system serve as fundamental guides to 
essential state purposes and expectations for higher education in a given 
context.

with regard to our second point, we argue that, in order to remain 
legitimate, states must distribute scarce resources in ways that are seen 
to be consistent with national or territorial expectations for fair and effi-
cient allocations. this is very much the case for higher education, where 
both  the  functions  of  postsecondary  institutions,  the  policies  shaping 
their organization and governance, and the allocation of places in those 
institutions must be consistent with state goals for higher education and 
equitable treatment of those who attend and the broader set of beneficia-
ries of the postsecondary project.

our  third  conceptual  pillar,  ideology,  begins  from  the  premise  that 
each  state  has  a  distinctive  ideological  approach  to  the  provision  of 
higher education and a different set of creation myths, sagas, and beliefs 
about national culture that motivate postsecondary policies and assure 
legitimacy (meyer & Rowan, 1977). these ideologies, sagas, and core 
beliefs are distinctive to each national context and each state. the con-
text shaping expectations for higher education in contemporary South 
africa, a nation with a fundamental need to increase equality of access 
and to build a new state apparatus through the education of a diverse 
set of professionals, is quite different from the context underpinning the 

University Rankings in Critical Perspective    553

postsecondary project in the United States, a system in which the high-
est form of academic capitalism is currently practiced and market com-
petition is framed as an end in itself (Slaughter & Rhoades, 2004).

taken together, intentionality, legitimacy, and ideology suggest that 
individual  states  will  have  distinctive  ranking  systems  appropriate  to 
measuring their own unique purposes and goals for higher education. 
We will now consider the specifics of those measurements.

Data Collection

for the purposes of this article, the authors analyzed a wide range of 
rankings systems, both national rankings with global importance, such 
as the U.S. News and World Report annual ranking of america’s Best 
colleges, and global rankings, such as those constructed by the Shang-
hai Jiao tong University institute of higher Education. in addition to 
those two, arguably the most prominent rankings systems in higher edu-
cation, the authors evaluated the rankings produced by the center for 
higher Education development in collaboration with Die Ziet (chE in 
Germany), the ranking system of the leiden University centre for Sci-
ence and technology Studies (cwtS in the Netherlands), the higher 
Education Evaluation and accreditation council of taiwan (hEEact), 
the Times Higher Education (Uk), the Universidad Nacional autónoma 
de  México  (UNAM),  and  webometrics.  It  should  be  noted  that  there 
are a large number of national ranking systems, all normative in intent, 
some of which use the same or similar techniques to those employed 
by the global rankings and U.S. News and World Report, which are dis-
cussed here (Salmi & Saroyan, 2006).

these rankings systems were evaluated for the degree to which their 
metrics reflect distinctive national norms and goals and, subsequently, 
the degree to which they vary from one another. the rankings systems 
were analyzed for the presence of such metrics as academic reputation, 
research  productivity,  institutional  resources,  student  characteristics, 
rates of participation and completion, faculty quality, attention to un-
derserved populations, and for the degree to which these metrics shaped 
rankings.

What the Rankings Measure

despite  the  expectation  of  unique  ranking  metrics  and  contextual 
variation,  the  analysis  of  rankings  suggests  there  is  surprisingly  little 
variation in what the rankings systems measure. that is, despite quite 
different  state  projects  and  national  contexts,  postsecondary  rankings 

554    The Journal of Higher Education

are remarkably similar. as table 1 demonstrates, academic reputation, 
institutional resources, faculty quality (e.g., as measured by prestige of 
terminal degree and compensation or by using proxy measures of qual-
ity such as student-staff ratios as in the Times Higher), and faculty re-
search  productivity  are  measures  that  figure  explicitly  or  implicitly 
across the systems. Reputational surveys are particularly important fac-
tors for U.S. News and the Times Higher. the Shanghai Jiao tong rank-
ings  are  focused  on  faculty  publications  and  reputation,  with  empha-
sis on citations in high-impact journals and honors, awards, and prizes 
garnered by individual faculty. webometrics, which focuses on the vis-
ibility of universities on the worldwide web, Google Scholar, and other 
new media, serves as an explicit indicator of “global presence,” a state 
objective underlying all global rankings.

taken together, the various rankings do not measure distinctiveness 
in mission—for example, by trapping individual variation in values or 
objectives.  Rather,  they  measure  institutional  wealth  and  prestige  in 
what is imagined as a common game, with research power, publications, 
resources, and student characteristics, such as selectivity in U.S. News, 
as proxies for wealth and prestige. this has enormous implications for 
states as they attempt to build and assess postsecondary projects that 
meet essential national commitments in distinctive contexts.

the concentration of ranking metrics on funded research, elite stu-
dents and faculty, and entrepreneurial revenue generation also defines 
the  fundamental  purposes  of  higher  education  in  all  state  projects  by 
its contribution to elite formation and research in the interests of eco-
nomic development, with a particular emphasis on individual and na-
tional wealth accumulation. these purposes are so distant from the lives 
and aspirations of the vast majority of individuals in states across the 
world that if we were building a system of comparison from the ground 
up it would be impossible to imagine such rankings achieving promi-
nence, let alone a monopoly on formal global accountability systems in 
higher education. But this they have done. the rankings present a highly

558    The Journal of Higher Education

marginson, 2007). Rankings also publicly legitimize a highly inequi-
table distribution of such public resources as research funding, subsi-
dies  for  student  attendance,  and  infrastructure  development. we  have 
argued elsewhere (marginson, 2007, 2009; pusser & marginson, 2012) 
that rankings and selectivity are bound together, as are selectivity and 
institutional prestige. in a world of increasing polarization between the 
modestly endowed many and the affluent few, postsecondary prestige 
rankings serve as one more accelerant.

Reputational  ranking  is  also  a  great  source  of  institutional  power, 
and institutions transform themselves in pursuit of that power. highly 
ranked colleges and universities attract highly prepared students from 
around  the  world  and  serve  as  key  platforms  for  global  networks  of 
influence. At  the  same  time,  rankings  generate  increased  competition 
within and between institutions and states. the traditionally collabor-
ative arena of knowledge production is pressed to preserve disciplin-
ary  and  academic  norms  in  the  face  of  the  annual  and  highly  visible 
accounting of achievement through metrics that parse institutional re-
source generation and prestige at school, department, program, and indi-
vidual faculty levels.

over time, there is a “rankings effect”: Rankings drive efforts by in-
stitutions and the state to pursue prestige through excellence in com-
petitive rankings. States and institutional managers seek the forms of 
behavior  and  specific  outcomes  that  will  maximize  rankings  perfor-
mance—for  example,  concentrations  of  high-quality  research  activ-
ity, enhanced student selectivity (often in tension with social access), 
marketing  campaigns  designed  to  artificially  boost  reputation,  and  so 
on. here rankings play a “disciplinary” role (foucault, 1977; Sauder & 
Espeland, 2009) in which national systems and individual institutions 
are both disciplined by the system of assessment and learn to discipline 
themselves by implementing its norms.

Because the norms of ranking systems are mostly consistent with the 
world’s  strongest  higher  education  institutions  located  in  the  United 
States,  this  disciplinary  effect  is  especially  invidious  in  nation-states 
outside  the  United  States.  despite  the  wide  global  variations  in  re-
sources, states of development, national histories, traditions, languages, 
and cultures, institutions outside the United States are pressed into fol-
lowing the template of the globally dominant universities that lead the 
rankings: research-intensive institutions with selective admissions poli-
cies,  conducting  funded  research  in  many  disciplines,  with  particular 
focuses on science and technology and elite professional schools. de-
spite the multiple and at times conflicting state goals embedded in the 

University Rankings in Critical Perspective    559

missions of postsecondary institutions around the world—for example, 
the differing inherited missions in relation to nation-building and social 
access—certain goals, such as science research outputs, have become 
increasingly preeminent. the disciplinary process of global ranking is 
both leading a process of global postsecondary strategic convergence 
and undermining aspects of traditional national policy agendas (mar-
ginson, 2007). in that respect, the state project being pursued here is not 
simply national but also neo-imperial, being most closely tailored to the 
interests of the nations traditionally dominant in the higher education 
sector: the western nations and, above all, the English-speaking nations 
led by the United States and United kingdom.

Contextualizing Contemporary Rankings

this convergence of global rankings around institutional wealth, re-
search productivity, faculty publications, and elite student characteris-
tics is surprising on a number of dimensions. first, despite a longstand-
ing  commitment  to  the  production  of  both  public  and  private  goods 
through  higher  education  in  nearly  every  state,  the  most  legitimate 
postsecondary  projects—as  measured  by  rankings  criteria—are  those 
that  produce  primarily  private  benefits.  This  duality,  the  university’s 
paradoxical roles as a site of stratification and of social mobility, has 
long  shaped  its  position  as  both  site  and  instrument  of  political  eco-
nomic contest (Gramsci, 1971; ordorika, 2003; Slaughter, 1990). Nor is 
this duality a significant constraint on the rapid acceleration in prestige 
rankings (Ehrenberg, 2003). thus, there is virtually no attention in any 
of the major rankings to such goals as improving the access of students 
from traditionally underrepresented groups, increasing the affordability 
of  high-quality  postsecondary  education,  contributions  to  community 
development, or social justice (pusser & marginson, 2012). this points 
to the manner in which rankings have become joined to neoliberal state 
projects that display a high level of commonality. Neoliberal restructur-
ing is applied in various national circumstances, but everywhere it en-
tails a partial evacuation of social agendas and the elevation of business 
values. in that respect all states are partly converging in their values, 
norms, and objectives, albeit on terms which sustain the dominant posi-
tion of the neo-liberal states.

this illustrates our central argument about the need to explain post-
secondary education in terms of power. to emphasize the point, given 
the inherent diversity of state needs and goals, and the manifold variety 
of institutional norms and cultures in higher education, this convergence 

560    The Journal of Higher Education

of  rankings  metrics  makes  little  sense,  unless  contextualized  within 
broader structures of power. we have argued that intention matters and 
that  states  consciously  choose  the  patterns  of  resource  allocation  and 
policies that build higher education systems. in turn, postsecondary in-
stitutions contribute purposefully to some aspects of state building over 
others (ordorika & pusser, 2007).

this mutually reinforcing process also legitimizes a distinct ideologi-
cal approach to postsecondary education. while the creation sagas of 
higher education in the United States are linked to the institutional role 
in training leaders for moral and political development in the colonial 
colleges and to community progress through agricultural and mechani-
cal sciences in the public land-grant colleges (Rudolph, 1965), inten-
tion,  legitimacy,  and  ideology  are  closely  linked  today  in  the  United 
States and globally through the project of neoliberal restructuring of the 
contemporary university and the contemporary state (pusser, kempner, 
marginson, & ordorika, 2011). the underlying purpose of this restruc-
turing project is wealth accumulation—accumulation for accumulation’s 
sake—and too often accumulation for the sake of the few. at the same 
time, postsecondary rankings and the associated demands for account-
ability, adaptation, and uncritical conformity are firmly rooted in neolib-
eral philosophy (Rhoads & torres, 2006) and further evidence the utility 
of rankings as mechanisms for setting and legitimizing neoliberal state 
agendas.

Limits on the Mobilization of Bias:  
Rankings That Use Alternate Norms

fortunately, the dominance of neoliberal metrics for evaluating post-
secondary organizations is not so totalizing that alternative models can-
not be countenanced. Nor do they need to be entirely theoretical or ab-
stract thought experiments. one particularly powerful example of the 
potential  for  a  counter-hegemonic  ranking  system  emerged  through  a 
national  study  of  U.S.  medical  schools  published  in  2010  (mullan, 
chen, petterson, kolsky, & Spagnola, 2010). medical schools, as with 
other postsecondary organizations, are traditionally ranked by metrics 
that focus on a relatively narrow set of outputs. the authors of the study 
noted:

medical schools are the only institutions in our society that can produce phy-
sicians;  yet  assessments  of  medical  schools,  such  as  the  well-known  U.S. 
News & World Report ranking system, often value research funding, school 
reputation, and student selectivity factors over the actual educational output 

University Rankings in Critical Perspective    561

of each school, particularly regarding the number of graduates who enter pri-
mary care, practice in underserved areas, and are underrepresented minori-
ties. (mullan, chen, petterson, kolsky, & Spagnola, 2010, p. 805)

at the time of the study, the U.S. congress had just passed, and presi-
dent obama had signed into law, a highly contested health care reform 
bill. among its many policy implications, the bill expanded access to 
health  care  to  traditionally  underserved  populations.  the  study  pre-
sented a ranking of U.S. medical schools based on a composite index 
created by the authors, the “Social mission Score” (SmS). the Social 
mission Score was based on analyses of the percentage of primary care 
graduates  in  each  medical  school,  the  percentage  of  graduates  from 
areas with health professional shortages (hpSas), and the percentage 
of underrepresented minority graduates from each school (mullan et al., 
2010).

the three institutions ranked most highly in the Social mission Score 
rankings were morehouse School of medicine, meharry medical col-
lege, and howard University college of medicine. None of the three 
were ranked in the top 90 schools (the complete published ranking) in 
U.S. News’ Best medical Schools – Research category for 2010 (mer-
edith, 2009). only the morehouse School of medicine (16 th) was ranked 
in the top 90 schools in U.S. News’ Best medical Schools – primary 
care category for 2010 (a ranking that includes as one factor the per-
centage of graduates entering primary-care specialties). furthermore, no 
school  ranked  in  the  top  20  of  the  Best medical  Schools  –  Research 
category also ranked in the top 20 in the Social mission Score index. 
of those institutions ranked in the top 20 in U.S. News’ Best medical 
Schools  –  primary  care  category,  two  (morehouse  School  of  medi -
cine  and  the  University  of iowa’s carver college  of medicine)  were 
also ranked in the top 20 on the Social mission Score index (meredith, 
2009). four institutions were cited in the article for combining high lev-
els of research productivity with exceptional primary care output: the 
University of minnesota, the University of washington, the University 
of california at San diego, and the University of colorado. Just as the 
ranking  of  SmS  and  Best medical  Schools  varied,  so  too  did  the  re-
sponses to the publication of the SmS. in each case, the perception of 
the utility of various metrics for ranking medical school activities and 
the prioritization of those activities depended on the ways in which vari-
ous commentators understood the potentials and purposes of contempo-
rary medical schools (fears, 2010; Gold, 2010).

these disparate perspectives again turn attention to the importance 
of context, ideology, and normative beliefs for understanding rankings. 

562    The Journal of Higher Education

the Social mission Score index serves as a leading example of the po-
tential for reframing excellence in postsecondary educational rankings 
by adapting the criteria used in ranking systems so that they measure 
the core mission and goals of the organizations under a particular state 
project.

another example of rankings based on counter-hegemonic norms is 
the system of university assessment developed by the Estudio compara-
tivo de Universidades mexicanas (EcUm), produced under the auspices 
of  the dirección  General de  Evaluación  at  the  Universidad  Nacional 
Autónoma de México (UNAM), the national university of mexico. this 
assessment has developed metrics for evaluating higher education insti-
tutions in mexico not simply on the basis of conventional research out-
puts but also in relation to democratic aspects of their public missions, 
including the expansion of social opportunities and public purposes of 
the mexican state through postsecondary provision. it is designed, in 
part, to address a challenge that was put this way: “Standardized mea-
sures of academic output become an international homogenizing force 
that throws universities of diverse origins, traditions and roles, into a 
common process of competition in uneven conditions and unequal pos-
sibilities for success” (ordorika, 2009, p. 74). the Estudio comparativo 
is also unique in that it provides comparative metrics but no actual rank-
ing (Márquez Jiménez, Lozano Espinosa, Ordorika Sacristán, & Rodrí-
guez Gómez, 2009).

Conclusion

the analysis of global ranking systems points to the manner in which 
postsecondary rankings simultaneously serve the purposes of states and 
leading postsecondary institutions, and hence the purposes of those so-
cial groups and economic interests best able to influence both. In fact, 
rankings confer on these dominant political formations in postsecond-
ary education a new degree of coherence even at a global level, where 
rankings increasingly regulate the operations of the “competition state” 
(cerny, 2007) in higher education. Notwithstanding the heterogeneity 
of  postsecondary  systems,  institutions,  norms,  and  policy  objectives 
around the world, there is a certain convergence and cross-national nor-
malization in the ranking process. here it can be argued that rankings 
are seen to embody a meta-state project—an imperial project (that is, 
a  project  embodying  the  interests  of  the  globally  strongest  states)  in 
which institutions are being slotted into a preordained global hierarchy. 
Rankings  are  also  normalizing  institutions  everywhere  according  to 
neoliberal strategies that elevate some nationally-based interests (busi-

University Rankings in Critical Perspective    563

ness,  finance  systems,  wealth  accumulation)  above  others  (especially 
those traditionally not provided by select models of postsecondary edu-
cation), while again strengthening the global position of the strongest 
nations. furthermore, by normalizing relations of intensive competition 
and hierarchy between institutions, rankings foster the worldview em-
bodied in neoliberalism (the social realm as a competitive marketplace), 
justify the unequal outcomes of unequal competition, and give comfort 
and legitimation to those who benefit most from the growing economic 
inequalities that have marked the neoliberal era. in doing so, they rein-
force both new and older forms of power.

this article has focused on the role of rankings as one manifestation 
of  contemporary  state,  social,  and  university  power.  further  studies 
might consider other aspects of the effects of rankings—for example, 
the impact of rankings and associated performance technologies in rela-
tions between the faculty and the administration in the contemporary 
university, an area noted but not fully explored here. what are the short-
term and long-term implications of rankings for academic freedom and 
creativity, and do these effects play out differently between leading uni-
versities (where academic freedom might be seen as one instrument fos-
tering a high rank but on the limited terms of the ranking criteria) and 
other institutions?

the application of critical theories of power to an analysis of global 
rankings turns attention to the role of prestige and privilege in shaping 
state  postsecondary  goals,  strategies,  and  patterns  of  resource  alloca-
tion. Similarly, future research and scholarship will benefit from critical 
political theories that place power at the center of conceptual models 
of such postsecondary domains as research policy and activity, postsec-
ondary  access,  educational  financing,  governance,  patterns  of  faculty 
mobility, and innovations in the curriculum. the use of critical concep-
tual models based in an analysis of power will offer new insight into a 
variety of contemporary challenges and lead to a better understanding of 
global higher education in the decades to come.
