Mechanistic approach

Purposive approach

analyzes phenomena regarding their causal 
structure

explains phenomena by what problem they 
solve i.e. function

determine structure & algorithms for cognitive 
phenomena

assortment of random mechanisms (due to 
neuroscience & experimental studies)

Rational Analysis (RA) by Anderson (1990)
→ ‘computational level’ (Marr) corresponds to 
rational analysis

(cognitive) system optimally adapted to task

neglects purpose of cognitive functions

use of probability theory (Bayes)

Introduction          Rational Analysis          Memory          Reasoning          Conclusion

Methodology (RA)

(1) Goals: specify goals of cognitive system
(2) Environment: develop formal model of environment
(3) Computational limitations: minimal assumptions about computational 

limitations

(4) Optimization: derive optimal behaviour function (see 1-3)
(5) Data: examine empirical evidence → predictions of behaviour function 

right?
Iteration: repeat (1) - (5) → fine-tune theory

(6)

Introduction          Rational Analysis          Memory          Reasoning          Conclusion

Memory  … fails gradually over time. 

- Structure of memory imperfect → storage problems → side effect (mechanistic)
-

Items recently read → more likely to be needed again → remembered better (RA)

→ Forgetting curve corresponds to curve of need-probability function p 

S   - memory item
H   - history factor
Q   - contextual cues

S
S

p = P(H  ).a(Q  )S

S

Probability that S will be needed given its 
usage history

Probability of observing the cues when S is 
needed → “strength of association”

Introduction          Rational Analysis          Memory          Reasoning          Conclusion

RA (Memory) 
(1) Goal: availability of item matches probability that it is needed (efficient retrieval)

(2) Environment: environment determines need-probability p

(3) Computational limitations: sequential search with cost C for each item

(4) Optimization: stop retrieval if pG < C i.e. retrieval costs exceed expected gain;

        p depends on context cues Q & item’s history usage H

(5) Data: account for power law of forgetting & power law of practice

(6)

Iteration: test models empirically; role of context (recurrence in newspaper   

                         headlines), manipulate need-probability → changes in forgetting curve 

Introduction          Rational Analysis          Memory          Reasoning          Conclusion

Power law of forgetting
memory items decay with time 
exponentially; 
→ need probability is decreasing  
     power function of time

Power law of practice
faster recall for more frequent items; 
→ need probability is increasing 
     power function of frequency

Power law of practice: reaction time decreases 

exponentially

Introduction          Rational Analysis          Memory          Reasoning          Conclusion

However...

- Power law of forgetting: artifacts of averaging over individuals ?

→ reply: also holds for individuals

- Schooler (1998): empirical evidence for context & history determining need-

probability 

→ BUT (!): time elapsed relatively more important than contextual cues

- Underlying processing mechanisms should be considered: e.g. capacity of 

short term memory

Introduction          Rational Analysis          Memory          Reasoning          Conclusion

The Wason Selection task

- Participants are shown a set of cards and a rule

- Task: turn the minimal amount of cards to check if the rule applies

- Contains optimal data selection:

- hypothesis (= rule)
- deciding on experiments (= deciding which card to turn)

Introduction          Rational Analysis          Memory          Reasoning          Conclusion

The Wason Selection task

Rule: Whenever there is a vowel on one side of the card,

there is an even number on the other side

A

K

Introduction          Rational Analysis          Memory          Reasoning          Conclusion

WST - Strategy

Popper’s falsificationist view on science:

- not possible to verify rules, only falsify them
- falsify rule by finding a contradiction between rule and data

→ Strategy: find case in which the rule does not hold

Introduction          Rational Analysis          Memory          Reasoning          Conclusion

WST - Strategy

Rule: p → q (p → vowel, q → even number)

Search for a case in which the
 
      conditional is false (i.e. p ʌ ¬ q)

WST - Results

Experimental results:

Introduction          Rational Analysis          Memory          Reasoning          Conclusion

Why do only 4% of the participants choose the logically 
right answer?

Is this a reason for doubting human rationality?

Introduction          Rational Analysis          Memory          Reasoning          Conclusion

WST in everyday life

Consider different example:

“If a saucepan falls, then it clangs”

p = a saucepan falls
q = it clangs

Introduction          Rational Analysis          Memory          Reasoning          Conclusion

WST in everyday life
If a saucepan falls (p), 
listen for a clang (q)

- ¬ q falsifies rule
- q makes the rule more plausible

If a clang is heard (q), 
check if saucepan has fallen (p)

- p makes the rule more plausible

Introduction          Rational Analysis          Memory          Reasoning          Conclusion

WST in everyday life

If no clang is heard (¬ q), 
check if a saucepan has fallen (p)

(p ʌ ¬ q) would falsify the rule

Introduction          Rational Analysis          Memory          Reasoning          Conclusion

WST in everyday life

(¬ p  ʌ ¬ q) gives no new information concerning the rule

→ case of ¬ p is very likely

→ Estimated information gain very small
→ Apparent confirmation of rules: more informative 
     than searching for contradictions if events are rare
    → look for causal relations instead of falsification 

Introduction          Rational Analysis          Memory          Reasoning          Conclusion

RA (Reasoning - The Wason Selection Task) 

Oaksford and Chater’s rational analysis:

- based on optimal data selection (ODS) from Bayesian statistics 

instead of Popper’s falsificationism

- adaptive instead of normative rationality

Introduction          Rational Analysis          Memory          Reasoning          Conclusion

RA (Reason) 

(1) Goal: selecting data with highest expected informativeness 

Introduction          Rational Analysis          Memory          Reasoning          Conclusion

RA (Reasoning) → Goals

ODS model: participants are unsure of whether hypothesis is true

→ equal probability for the case that rule (p → q) is true and the case that p and q are 
independent

→ Calculate uncertainty of HD after experiment (e):

P(HD | D, e)

D = Data
HD = hypothesis is true

P(HD) = 0.5  =  P(HI)  

Probability of 
hypothesis 
being true

Probability of 
p and q being 
independent

Introduction          Rational Analysis          Memory          Reasoning          Conclusion

RA (Reasoning) → Goals

Likelihoods of outcomes when turning 2-card can be calculated by contingency tables used 
in ODS model [P(A | 2, HD), P(K | 2, HD), P(A | 2, HI), P(K | 2, HI)]

Then P(HD | A, 2)] can be calculated by Baye’s theorem

→ One can use this probability to calculate uncertainty after turning the 2 | A 
     card: 

I(HD | A, 2)

HD = hypothesis is true
I = uncertainty

Introduction          Rational Analysis          Memory          Reasoning          Conclusion

RA (Reasoning) → Goals

Participants can not really turn cards in WST → need expected value of uncertainty

→ I(HD | A, 2) and I(HD | K, 2) are weighted by the expected value of P(K | 2) and P(A | 2)

E[I(HD | 2)]

HD = hypothesis is true
E = expectation
I = uncertainty

Difference between uncertainty in the beginning I(HD) and expected uncertainty after 
turning the cards E[I(HD | 2)] is the information gain Elg(e) one can expect from carrying 
out the experiment (e):

Elg(e) = I(HD) - E[I(HD | e)]

Introduction          Rational Analysis          Memory          Reasoning          Conclusion

RA (Reason) 

(1) Goal: selecting data with highest expected informativeness 
(2) Environment: rarity assumption: more plausible to check in case of rare event (q)

(3) Computational limitations: assumed costs for examining data - as little as possible

(4) Optimization: rarity assumption leads to an order of expected information gain: 

Elg(p) > Elg(q) > Elg(¬ q)  > Elg(¬ p)

(5) Data: human approximate bayesian statistics - turing ¬ q card is not worth the cost

Introduction          Rational Analysis          Memory          Reasoning          Conclusion

RA (Reasoning) → Optimization

Elg(p) > Elg(q) > Elg(¬ q)  > Elg(¬ p)

participants evaluate the costs, 
decide how many cards to turn 
and turn most informative cards in 
the given order !

p and q cards

p card only

p, q and ¬ q cards

p and ¬ q cards

Introduction          Rational Analysis          Memory          Reasoning          Conclusion

RA (Reasoning) → Optimization

Elg(p) > Elg(q) > Elg(¬ q)  > Elg(¬ p)

participants evaluate the costs, 
decide how many cards to turn 
and turn most informative cards in 
the given order !

Introduction          Rational Analysis          Memory          Reasoning          Conclusion

RA (Reason) 

(1) Goal: selecting data with highest expected informativeness 
(2) Environment: rarity assumption: more plausible to check in case of rare event (q)

(3) Computational limitations: assumed costs for examining data - as little as possible

Elg(p) > Elg(q) > Elg(¬ q)  > Elg(¬ p)

(5) Data: human approximate bayesian statistics - turing ¬ q card is not worth the cost

(6)

Iteration: predicts that selection task performance changes if rarity assumption 
is violated 

Introduction          Rational Analysis          Memory          Reasoning          Conclusion

Rule: Whenever somebody is drinking beer, 

(s)he is at least 21 years old

Introduction          Rational Analysis          Memory          Reasoning          Conclusion

Still doubt human rationality?
- Systems / organisms (e.g. humans) are adapted to real world environments

- Behaviour optimized for many different situations given certain costs

→ approximate optimization due to uncertainty

- But: non-optimal in specific situations (like experiments)

-

‘Irrational’ behavior: may be result of unnatural / “artificial” or unusual situations

→  people don’t follow rules of logic (WST)

→ “more correct” when rules framed in real-world scenarios 

→ in real world: causal events are rare, experiments don’t consider

Introduction          Rational Analysis          Memory          Reasoning          Conclusion

Conclusion
- Traditional explanations neglect purpose of cognitive mechanisms
- RA successful in explaining memory & reasoning → formalizes “intuition” (of human 

behaviour)

- System adapts to environment → optimal behavior explains why cognitive 

mechanisms do the way they do

- Constrains models & predicts possible outcomes → new directions for theory 

development  

Can RA be applied to every cognitive process?
