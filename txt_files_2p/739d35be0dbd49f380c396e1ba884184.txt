Key Findings

•	 Tanzania’s	 strategy	 of	 maintaining	 a	 high-value	 tourist	 product	 and	 attracting	 large	 numbers	 of	 foreign	
tourists is clearly working - with the delivery of significant benefits to Tanzania as a whole and poor people  
living near tourist destinations

•	 Tanzania	is	capturing	about	half	of	the	total	value	of	the	global	value	chain	for	Mount	Kilimanjaro	climbing	
and Northern Safari Circuit package holidays sold in Europe – a reasonable proportion given the cost of 
long-haul flights

•	

International	package	tourists	climbing	Mount	Kilimanjaro	and	visiting	the	Northern	Safari	Circuit	deliver	
significant benefits to the poor. Approximately 28% and 18% of in-country tourist spending respectively 
is reaching poor people at the destination. International comparisons suggest that poor Tanzanians are 
capturing a relatively large share of tourist spending

•	 There	are	a	series	of	simple	and	practical	steps	that	could	be	taken	to	increase	the	pro-poor	benefits	of	
Mount	Kilimanjaro	climbing	and	Northern	Safari	Circuit	package	holidays.	These	findings	were	validated	
during a consultation process with stakeholders which is summarised at the end of this document

•	 At	Mount	Kilimanjaro,	the	key	is	in	ensuring	that	climbing	staff	gain	a	reasonable	share	of	the	value	they	
are creating, principally by strengthening the Porters & Guides Association.  Supporting the Tanzanian 
National Parks Authority to spend its community development fund effectively and encouraging multi-
stakeholder dialogue would also increase benefit flows to the poor

•	

In	the	Northern	Safari	Circuit	there	is	room	for	improving	the	effectiveness	of	the	flow	of	benefits	to	
the poor from park fees that are ear-marked for community and household development – particularly 
in the Ngorongoro area. Also better linking poor local producers into the hotel food supply chain and 
improving the quality of hospitality training will enhance the transfer of resources from international 
tourists to the poor 

A success story

Tourism in Tanzania is a success. In one of the poorest countries in the world, a tourist destination has been 
created that is both growing and maintaining a high quality product. Combining increasing visitor numbers, 
high  spending  tourists  and  a  respectable  length  of  stay  is  a  real  achievement  (and  one  that  has  eluded 
several more affluent African countries with much larger tourism sectors).

As  a  result,  tourism  is  very  important 
to the Tanzanian economy. In 2007, the 
tourism  sector  directly  and  indirectly 
contributed  US$1.6billion  –  or  almost 
11%  of  the  entire  Tanzanian  economy. 
This  equates  to  US$43  for  every  man, 
woman and child in the country.

foreigners. 

International 

Perhaps  even  more  striking 
is  the 
effect  of  tourism  on  Tanzanian  exports 
because most tourist spending is made 
by 
tourists 
spending  money  in  Tanzania  are  an 
‘export’ because they bring money into 
the  country  from  overseas.  In  2008 
it  is  estimated  that  foreign  tourists 
contributed  US$1.1billion  of 
foreign 
exchange – nearly 33% of all the goods 
and services sold by Tanzania abroad.
