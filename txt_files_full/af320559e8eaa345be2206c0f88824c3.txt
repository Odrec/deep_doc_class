Holocene climate changes and warm man-made refugia may explain
why a sixth of British butterflies possess unnatural early-successional
habitats

Analyses of their habitats indicate that  18% of British  butterfly
species  are  restricted  to  the earliest  serai  stages of  ecosystems,
whereas  the  same  species  occupy  later  serai  stages  in  central
Europe,  where  spring  and  summer  temperatures  are  warmer.
The  microclimates  of  their  British  habitats  are  exceptionally
warm, compensating  for the cooler climate.  Most of these Brit-
ish habitats are also ephemeral, and have long depended on man
for  their  creation  and  regeneration  This  poses  the  question  of
where  these  species  lived  before  man  created  their  habitats,
roughly  6000  BP,  I  suggest  that  they  are  relics  from  a  period
when  British  summers  were  warmer  than  today,  and that they
avoided  extinction  when  the  climate  cooled  hy  moving  into
warm  refugia  created  hy  prehistoric  man  within  three  types of
ecosystem  If summer temperatures become warmer, these spe-
cies should  return  to  later  serai  stages that  are commoner  and
less dependent  on man.

Introduction
Most  of  the  55 non-migratory  species of  butterfly  that
breed  in  Britain  have  abrupt  northern  limits  to  their
ranges  which  correlate  closely  with  summer  isotherms
(Dennis  1977, Heath  et  al  1984, Dennis  and  Wilhams
1986, Turner  et  al  1987)  Within  these  ranges, c  80%
ot  species  live  in  predominantly  closed  populations,
each  restricted  m its  local  distribution  by the  distribu-
tion of Its larval foodplant(s)  (Thomas  1984)  However,
few  species  occupy  more  than  a  small  fraction  of  the
sites  that  fulfil  these  basic  requirements  (Heath  et  al
1984, Thomas  1984)  Research  on  43% of  Bntish  but-
terfly  species has shown that, with three exceptions, this
IS because temales are selective during oviposition, and
restrict  egglaying  to foodplants  of  a particular  growth-
form  or micro-habitat,  species are confined  to localities
where plants of the required growth-forms exist m suffi-
cient  abundance,  and  continuity,  for  a  population  to
survive  (Thomas  1991)

The  narrowest  and  most  ephemeral  niches  recorded
among  Bntish  butterflies  belong  to  the  10  (18%  of)
species that  breed near the ground  in the earliest  stages
of  seres  (Thomas  1991)  Grassland  examples  include
Macuhnea anon  L  (which is an obligate parasite of the
ant  Myrmtca sabulett Meinert)  (Thomas  1991), Lxsan-
dra bellargus Rott  (Thomas  1983), Hesperta comma L
(Thomas  et  al  1986), Melitaea  ctnxta L  (Thomas  and
Simcox  1982, Thomas  1991) and  Htpparchta semele  L
(Heath  et  al  1984)  Boloria euphrosyne L ,  B  selene
Denis  & Schiff  , Argynnts adippe Denis  & Schiff  and
Mellicta athalta Rott  also  breed  in  the  earliest  serai
stages of  British  grassland,  but  most  populations  occur
in  recent  woodland  clearings  (Warren  1987a,  Warren
and Thomas  1992)  At the northern limit of its range, on
Welsh  heathland,  Plebejus  argus  L 
is  restncted  to
patches where the vegetation  has been burnt or cleared
in the previous five  years (Thomas, C  D  1983, 1985)
The ephemeral  British habitats of seven of these spe-
cies  depend  entirely  on  man  for  their  regeneration,
whereas  a  minority  of  populations  of  P  argus and H
semele also breed in "natural" pnmary habitats, such as
dunes and undercliffs,  Melitaea ctnxta is wholly depend-
ent on the  latter  in Britain  (Heath  et  al  1984, Thomas
1991)  This  IS no  recent  phenomenon  since  reeords
began,  most  or  all  populations  of  these  species  (apart
from  M  cinxta) bred  on  land  that  was being  managed
by the traditional  methods that  have prevailed  on  Brit-
ish heaths, grasslands and woods from  roughly 6000 BP
until  the  present  century  (Harris  1766,  Barrett  1893,
Heath  et al  1984, Thomas  1984,  1991, Rackham  1986,
Warren  and  Key  1991)  indeed,  it  is because  modern
forms of management have reduced both the abundance
and continuity of early serai stages within all three eco-
systems,  that  there  have  been  exceptionally  severe  re-
cent  declines  of  the  nine  species  that  inhabit  them
(Heath  et  al  1984)  populations  typically  survive  2-10

yr after  traditional management is abandoned  (Thomas
1984, 1991)

This raises the question  as to where these  butterflies
lived  between  c  95CX) BP,  when  modern  insects  rein-
vaded  Britain  after  the  last  ice  age  (Osborne  1976,
Dennis  1977,  1992)  and  c  6000  BP,  when  man  first
created their early serai habitats (Rackham 1986)  It is a
question  relevant  to other  taxa in Britain, and  perhaps
elsewhere in northern Europe  The suggestion that Brit-
ish butterfly  populations are more recent colonists from
southern  Europe  is untenable, due to their  distribution
pattern on the remoter islands, and to the subspeciation
and other adaptations  that  have evolved  (Dennis 1977,
1992)  Moreover  all seven  species in  this group whose
dispersal  has  been  studied  were  found  to be  unusually
sedentary  (Thomas  and  Simcox  1982,  Thomas  1983,
1991, Thomas,  C  D  1983, 1985, Thomas  et  al  1986,
Warren  1987b,  Thomas  and  Snazell  1989,  1985, Tho-
mas, C  D  etal  1992),itisextremely unlikely that they
could  have  crossed  the  English  Channel  after  the  land
hnk was broken, roughly 1000 yr before man altered the
British  landscape  The  sedentariness  and  population
structure  of  these  butterflies  also  make  it  improbable
that  even  the  four  species  that  inhabit  modern  wood-
land could have utilised their narrow niches when these
occasionally  existed,  for  periods  of  1 to  10 yr,  in small
isolated  patches  in the  ancient  wildwood  following  the
death  of  a  large  tree  (Warren  1987  a,b,  Thomas  and
Snazell  1989)

I drew attention to this conundrum  in a review of the
conservation  of  European  butterflies  (Thomas  1991),
and  speculated  that  these  species  might  once  have  in-
habited broader or different  niches to those of today  In
this paper I bring together  the published  evidence sup-
porting this idea, and present  new data on  lntraspecific
variation  in  niche  breadth,  and  on  the  warm  microcli-
mates inhabited by the young stages of some butterflies
I  also  extend  my  hypothesis,  by  suggesting  how  these
species may have survived m Britain when summer tem-
peratures  became  cooler,  after  the  land  link  with  the
continent  was broken

Methods and  sources
Niche  breadth  of butterflies  and ants at  different
latitudes
Precise  definitions  of  the  current  British  habitats  of
seven  species  were  obtained  from  publications,  theses
or  conservation  reports  Hesperia comma  (Thomas  et
al  1986),  Melitaea cinxia (Thomas  and  Simcox  1982,
Thomas  1991), Boloria euphrosyne, B  selene, and y4r-
gynnis adtppe (Thomas et al  in press), Mellicta athalta
(Warren  1987a),  Plebejus argus in  north  Wales  (Tho-
mas, C  D  1983) and south  England  (Read  1986)

In  addition,  the  distribution  of  2nd  generation  Ly-

sandra bellargus eggs was recorded in swards of varying

height on Old Winchester Hill, Hampshire, S  England
Annual counts were made on 30 randomly chosen Hip-
pocrepis comosa plants m each of 15 adjoining  compart-
ments  that  were  grazed  on  rotation  in  1982-86  Plant
height  (Thomas  1983) and  the  number  of  eggs was re-
corded  in each of the 2250 samples

Variation in the abundance of the ant Myrmica sabu-
leti was  recorded  by baiting  or  by pit-fall  trapping  be-
neath  Thymus spp  and Origanum vulgare L  (the early
larval foodplants of Maculinea anon),  in swards of vary-
ing  height  on  land  with  varying  aspects  Ants  were
sampled during the peak evening foraging  period of M
sabuleti beneath  plants  containing  M  arton  eggs,  or
beneath  suitable  oviposition  plants  on  extinct  sites
Pooled  data  are  presented  from  one  occupied  and  six
extinct  M  anon  sites in SW England  (N  =  347),  from
SIX occupied  and  two  unoccupied  sites  in  Dordogne,
France  (N  =  227),  and  from  five  occupied  sites  in
Oland,  Sweden  (N  =  97)

Munguira  (pers  comm  ) descnbed  the sward heights
and aspects inhabited  by L  bellargus and H  comma in
Spain  and south France, and  I recorded  the  occupancy
of  shaded  woods  in  Dordogne  and  the  Rhone  Valley,
France  by the four  species of  fntillary

Microclimate  measurements
I  measured  temperature  in the  niches occupied  by lar-
vae,  and  in  similar  situations  beneath  foodplants  re-
jected  for  oviposition,  in  a  range  of  turf  heights  in
south-facing grassland in south England  Measurements
were made in cloudy-bright  weather  in Apnl  and May,
using a thermocouple, for L  bellargus (Thomas 1983. N
=  67) and M  anon  (new data,  N =  143), and in Octo-
ber using a laser thermometer for H  comma (new data,
N =  58)  Thomas,  C  D  (1983) used  the  former  tech-
nique  for  P  argus on  south-facing  heathland  in  north
Wales

Integrated temperatures were measured m the niches

of B  euphrosyne (N  =  16 x  12) and B  selene (N  =  16
X 12), dunng the  12 wk feeding  period  of their  larvae,
using  Pallman's  sucrose  inversion  method  (Lee  1969)
Measurements  were  made  m  woodland  blocks  m  S
England that had been eut 3 months (B  euphrosyne) or
18 months  (B  selene) earher  Integrated  temperatures
were also measured beneath unsuitable Viola (N = 32 x
12) growing under shrubs that had not been cut for c  15

from  the  evidence  of  Sawyer  1966, Pearson  1978, Wi-

there only on sites where many foodplants  grew in turf

hottest  niches  currently  available  in British  grassland
(Fig  2a),  yet  occupy  20  cm  to 40  em  tall  swards on
slopes of all aspects in lowland central France and Spam
(Munguira pers  comm )  And  in the extreme south of
England, P argus breeds in both the pioneer and build-
ing  phases  of heathland,  again  on all aspects  (Read
1986),  compared  with  its  restriction  to the  hottest
patches of south-facing  pioneer  heathland  that  exist in
north  Wales  (Thomas,  C  D  1983,  Fig  2a),  where
summer temperatures  are c  2°C cooler

In the woodland ecosystem, Bolorta euphrosyne feeds
on  Viola spp  in only  the  first  five  years  after  a clear-
ance,  and B  selene, A  adtppe  and M  athalta  are
shaded  out  before  10  years'  regrowth,  although  their
foodplants persist for much longer (Warren  1987a, War-
ren  and  Thomas  1992, Thomas et al  in press)  These
also  represent  the  warmest  microclimates  available  on
British woodland  floors  (Fig 2b), whereas all four  spe-
cies occur  in semi-shaded  woodland  in central  France

Past summer  climates  and  the  availability  of
anthropogenic  habitats
Published  evidence  of climatic  change  over  the past
8000 yr  is conflicting,  but  not  in  details  that  affect  my
hypothesis  There is a consensus that 8000-6000 BP was
a period of relative warmth (Wigley et al  1986, Folland
et al  1990), when average British summer temperatures
were up to 2°C higher than today (although winters may
have  been  colder),  especially  towards  the  end  of this
penod  (Huntley  and  Prentice  1988, Wigley  and  Kelly
1990,  Folland  et al  1990) This  optimum  may  have
lasted until 5300 or 5000 BP, before the summer climate
cooled  to something  similar  to or colder  than  that of
today  (Folland et al  1990)  Since then  there  may have
been nine century-timescale  periods, including the Litt-

anthropogenic  creation  of  downs,

M  ctnxta (Thomas and Simcox 1982, Thomas 1991) and
Htpparchia semele (Heath et al  1984)

The  niches  occupied  by  these  species  represent  the
warmest  microclimates  that  are available  in  British
grassland  (Fig  2a)  For  example,  an  increase in  mean
turf  height  from  2 cm to 5 cm on British M  arton sites
causes  the  ground  to become  c  3°C cooler  (Fig 2a),
and  results in a rapid  decline of Myrmica sabuleti fol-
lowed  by the  local  extinction  of  the  butterfly  (Thomas
1984,  1991)  However in Dordogne, where  mean  sum-
mer  tempeiatures  are  currently c  3°C warmer  than in
south  Britain  (Fig  3), M  sabulett is abundant  only on
north-facing  slopes and on flat  land where the sward is
tall  (Fig  la)  Thus in central  Europe,  M  anon  is con-
fined  to a locally cool, late serai stage withm grassland
this IS more widespread, less ephemeral, and much less
dependent on man than its habitat in modern Bntain In
Oland,  where  mean  July  temperatures  are 1°C-2°C
warmer  than in south  Bntain, M  sabulett is abundant
enough  to support  M  anon  on  flat  terrain  and  south-
facing slopes, in swards ranging from 3 em to 10 cm tall
This too IS a much more widespread  form  of grassland
than  the British  habitat  of M  anon

le Ice Age, when  mean  summer temperatures were up
to 0 9°C cooler  than  today  (Grove  1988, Wigley 1988,
Wigley and Kelly  1990)  In intervening centuries, sum-
mer  temperatures  were  similar  to  or  temporarily
warmer  than  today,  the  main  warm  period  being  the
Medieval  Warm  Epoch  of  1100-700  BP  A  simplified
reconstruction  of  these changes is given in Fig 4, omit-
ting some cool intervals postulated by Wigley and Kelly
(1990), which do not affect  my hypothesis, and showing
in  dashed  lines  the  periods  for  which  evidence  is con-
flicting or obscure  Figure 4 also shows the approximate
dates when the land link between Britain and the conti-
nent  disappeared,  and  when  man  created  warm  early
serai habitats within  three  ecosystems

Hypothesis for  the survival of thermophilous
butterflies  since 6000 BP
I suggest that  the ten species of butterfly  that  currently
depend  on  early  successional  habitats  in  Bntain  are
relics  from  a period  when  summer  temperatures  were
warmer  (Fig  4), and  that their pnmary  habitats  before
5000-6000  BP  were  m  later,  longer-lived  successional
stages, corresponding to their modern habitats in Oland
or  central  Europe  (e g  Fig  la)  These  habitats  were
probably quite common m pnmaeval Bntish woodland,
given the extensive clearings made  by beavers (Warren
and  Key  1991),  and  the  presence  of  herbivores  to
browse gaps (Rackham  1986)  Moreover,  most of such
permanent  grassland  and  heathland  as  existed  would
have been habitable under a warmer climate, in contrast
to the very small proportion  that is south-facing,  south-
erly and close-cropped, and hence warm enough today
It follows  that  all except  P  argus, H  semele and M

cinxia of this group should have become extinct roughly
5000 yr ago, when the climate entered the first extended
cool  period  after  the  land  hnk  with  the  continent  was
broken  However, by then man had been making signif-
icant  woodland  clearings  for  at  least  a  thousand  years
(Fig  4),  creating  heaths  and  grasslands  and,  through
domestic  grazing,  early  successional  habitats  within
these, as well as plots of freshly  cut woodland that were
easy to crop for fuel  (Smith  1980, Rackham  1986, Webb
1986)  The  warm  microclimates  that  these  inevitably
contained  (Fig  2) should  have more than  compensated
for the cooling of the climate  I suggest that these seven
(13%)  of  British  butterfly  species  survived  by moving
into warm man-made refugia,  where they lived until the
next  warm  period  allowed  them  temporarily  to  reoc-
cupy later serai stages, and perhaps to spread into warm
anthropogenic  habitats further  north  By the same rea-
soning,  these  species  were  probably  more  restricted
than today dunng the coldest periods, such as the Little
Ice  Age  Maculinea  anon  was  perhaps  confined  to
southern south-facing sites with exceptionally short (0 5
cm  -  1  cm)  swards,  where  temperatures  at  the  soil

282

surface  are  1°C -  4°C higher  than  under  the longest  (2
cm) grassland that can support M  anon today (Fig  2a)
There  is no fossil  record  of  butterflies  with which  to
test  this  theory,  but  data  for  Coleoptera  are  broadly
consistent  with  it  Around  10000 BP, the  Bntish  Mid-
lands experienced  an  abrupt  extinction  of  species  now
typical  of  northern  latitudes  or  high  ground,  and  by
9500-9000 BP had been colonised by assemblages simi-
lar to those  of southern  Bntain  today, plus a few  ther-
mophilous species now restricted  to the continent  (Os-
borne  1976)  Twenty-three  of  these  species  have  since
disappeared,  most  around  3000 BP, insofar  as this can
be  dated  (Osborne  1976,  Girling  1984)  Most  extinc-
tions  were  of  arboreal  species,  '"many 
of  which  are
now  only  found  further  south  on  the  continent"  (Os-
borne  1976),  both  Girling  (1984)  and  Osborne  (1976)
implicate  forest  clearance  and  climatic  cooling  as con-
tributory  factors

My theory for butterflies also implies a disproportion-
ately  high  extinction  rate  among  thermophilous  arbo-
real insects after  5000 BP, because the warm microhab-
ltats  created  by  traditional  land  management  exist
mainly at ground level, not in shrubs and trees  It is also
unlikely  that  prehistoric  man  created  warm  habitats
within aquatic systems, in which a thermophilous Gyri-
nid  became  extinct  during  the  Little  Ice  Age  (Girling
1984)  On the other hand, the prehistoric extinction of a
thermophilous  ground-living  species  of  dung  beetle  is
inconsistent  with  my theory  (Osborne  1976)

Stronger support comes from  the sub-fossil  record of
one of the few "arboreal" beetles to have warm habitats
provided by man (Buckland  1975)  Xestobium rufovillo-
sum  Deg  oviposits  in  the  fungal-infested  timbers  of
dwellings,  as  well  as  m  dead  wood  m  the  wild  Wild
British  populations  existed  well  north  of  their  current
range during the early  Medieval  Warm  Epoch, but be-
came confined  to the Midlands and south England  dur-
ing the Little Ice Age and subsequently  Yet X  rufovil-
losum  survived  locally  throughout  its  former  northern
range "in the artificially  warm habitats created by man"
in  urban  centres,  such  as  York  (Buckland  1975)  It  is
easy to envisage  a slightly more  thermophilous  species
than  X  rufovillosum  disappearing  completely  in  the
wild when the climate cooled, yet surviving as a British
species in southern  cities

Conservation
I  conclude  that  seven  species  of  British  butterfly
avoided extinction  by moving into warm man-made re-
fugia  c  5000 yr  ago  But  extinction  was  merely  post-
poned  in  the  present  cerrtury  British  farmers  and  for-
esters have largely abandoned traditional forms of man-
agement,  in  favour  of  regimes  that  produce  shadier
woods, tall swards in unfertilised  grassland, and mature
or  degenerate  heathland  (Smith  1980,  Thomas  1984,

and Thomas  1992)  This has resulted in cooler microcli-
mates  in  the  ground  layers  of  most  sites  (Fig  2),  and
caused  the  extinction  of  most  populations  of  thermo-
philous butterfly  species  (Heath  et  al  1984)

Many climatologists  predict  that  mean  summer  tem-
peratures  will  rise  over  the  next  50  yr,  through  the
greenhouse  effect  or  as  a  further  recovery  from  the
Little  Ice  Age  If  so,  I  predict  that  these  rare  British
butterflies will once again expand into later successional
niches  These  habitats are still locally common  in semi-
natural ecosystems m northern  Europe, and require less
intensive conservation management  This interpretation
offers  an incentive and justification  for conservationists,
who  are  sometimes  criticised  for  preserving  unnatural
obsolete  forms  of  land-use  in  ecosystems  It  is partic-
ularly  important  that  populations  of  scarce  thermophi-
lous species are maintained  in Britain  under the present
climate,  because  these  will  be  the  founders  of  most
future  expansions,  only  the  most  mobile  species  are
likely  to  recolonise  Britain  from  across  the  English
Channel
