“A Framework for Asserting the Moral 
Status of ‘Manipulation’  “  

in: MANIPULATION Theory and Practice p. 121- 134 

 

In my opinion to determine whether manipulation is morally 
wrong makes no sense because the word ‘manipulation’ has 
been and still is always used with a negative connotation. 
What is morally unobjectionable is no manipulation. 

Thus I wonder whether the moral framework to judge over 

the status of manipulation proposed in the article makes 
any sense at all or whether it is just a framework for 
judging about a persons’ behaviour towards another 
person in general.
