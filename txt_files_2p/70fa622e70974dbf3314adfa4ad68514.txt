Abstract

This study examined the production and perception of English vowels by native Korean (NK) learners of
English on two occasions separated by about 1 year. A preliminary experiment revealed that NK adults
classiﬁed some pairs of contrastive English vowels using two different Korean vowels whereas other pairs
showed classiﬁcation overlap,
implying they would be difﬁcult for Korean learners of English to
discriminate. In two subsequent experiments, NK adults and children differing in length of residence in
North America (3 vs. 5 years; 4 groups of 18 each) were compared to age-matched native English (NE)
speakers. In Experiment 2, NK children were found to discriminate English vowels more accurately than
/
were elicited using a picture-naming task. Some vowels produced by NK children were heard as intended
signiﬁcantly more often than vowels produced by NK adults. Acoustic analyses revealed that NK children
produced signiﬁcantly larger between-vowel contrasts than NK adults but did not differ from NE children.

Taken together, the results suggested that although children are more successful than adults in learning the
phonetic properties of second-language vowels, they might continue to differ from age-matched native
speakers in certain respects as uncovered by the vowel discrimination test in Experiment 2.

1. Introduction

The notion that ‘‘earlier is better’’ with respect to second language (L2) speech learning is well
accepted (see Singleton, 1989 for a review). As discussed by Snow (1987, page 192), it is widely
believed that children are able to learn an L2 ‘‘quickly, automatically, effortlessly, and to a level
indistinguishable from that of native speakers’’ whereas L2 learning in adulthood is conceived as
something that is ‘‘slow, effortful, and often less than perfectly successful’’. The purpose of the
present study was to evaluate this view of adult–child differences in L2 speech learning. It did so
by examining the discrimination and production of English vowels by native Korean (NK) adults
and children who were learning English as an L2.

Most evidence that children are better able than adults to learn L2 speech is indirect, inasmuch
as it comes from studies employing a retrospective developmental design in which comparisons
are made between groups of adult participants differing in age of ﬁrst exposure to an L2.
Participants ﬁrst exposed to their L2 as children (‘‘early learners’’) typically show more native-like
performance than participants ﬁrst exposed to the L2 in late adolescence or adulthood (‘‘late
learners’’). Signiﬁcant early-late differences have been observed for the production and perception
of L2 consonants (e.g., Flege, Munro, & MacKay, 1995; Yamada, 1995; Mackay, Flege, Piske, &
Schirru, 2001), the production and perception of L2 vowels (e.g., Munro, Flege, & MacKay, 1996;
Flege, MacKay, & Meador, 1999a; Piske, Flege, MacKay, & Meador, 2002; Flege, Schirru, &
MacKay, 2003), and overall degree of foreign accent (e.g., Seliger, Krashen, & Ladefoged, 1975;
Oyama, 1976; Yeni-Komshian, Flege, & Liu, 2000).

Most studies just mentioned compared groups of adult immigrants who differed in age of
arrival (AOA) in a predominantly L2-speaking country. Given that chronological age was not
controlled, length of residence (LOR) was necessarily confounded with the participants’ AOA (see
Flege, 1998, for review). Also, the early learners had generally lived in an L2-speaking country for
many years at the time of testing. Thus, another limitation of a retrospective developmental
design is that it provides little insight into adult–child differences in early stages of L2 learning.
More direct evidence of adult–child differences in L2 speech learning could be obtained by
directly comparing adults to children. If children are really better able than adults to learn L2
speech, they should show greater improvement in performance than adults over time in a
longitudinal study. An effect of chronological age might also be obtained by comparing groups of
adults and children who differed in LOR. The traditional view of adult–child differences suggests
that children would show a greater effect of apparent time (i.e., show a greater effect of LOR)
than adults.

A review of the existing literature provides only partial support for the expectations just
outlined. One of the few direct adult–child comparisons in the literature is that of Snow and
Hoefnagel-Ho¨ hle (1978), who examined vowel discrimination and word production by native
English (NE) adults and 3–15 year-old NE children who were learning Dutch as an L2. The NE
