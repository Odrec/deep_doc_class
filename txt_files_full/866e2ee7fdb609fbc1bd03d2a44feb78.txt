At both the immunoglobulin heavy and kappa light chain loci, there are >100 functional
variable (V) genes spread over >2 Mb that must move into close proximity in 3D space
to the (D)J genes to create a diverse repertoire of antibodies. Similar events take place at
the T cell receptor (TCR) loci to create a wide repertoire of TCRs. In this review, we will
discuss the role of CTCF in forming rosette-like structures at the antigen receptor (AgR)
loci, and the varied roles it plays in alternately facilitating and repressing V(D)J rearrange-
ments. In addition, non-coding RNAs, also known as germline transcription, can shape
the 3D conﬁguration of the Igh locus, and presumably that of the other AgR loci. At the
Igh locus, this could occur by gathering the regions being transcribed in the VH locus into
the same transcription factory where Iµ is being transcribed. Since the Iµ promoter, Eµ,
is adjacent to the DJH rearrangement to which one V gene will ultimately rearrange, the
process of germline transcription itself, prominent in the distal half of the VH locus, may
play an important and direct role in locus compaction. Finally, we will discuss the impact
of the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape of the Igh locus on VH gene rearrangement
frequencies.

INTRODUCTION
Antigen receptor (AgR) loci are facing a uniquely difﬁcult task to
produce a great diversity of receptors in order to recognize the
limitless possibility of antigens present in the environment of an
organism. With the advent of next generation sequencing, we can
now determine the actual diversity of AgRs by sequencing all of
the rearrangements from developing B and T cells. This diversity
is created through the combinatorial recombination of multiple
variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments at AgR
loci by the RAG1/2 recombinase complex, along with the extensive
junctional diversity at the V–D, D–J, and V–J junctions.

One of the most extensively studied AgR loci is the mouse Igh
locus where the VH, DH, and JH gene segments span a region of
~2.8 Mb (Figure 1). The 8–13 DH genes, the four JH genes, and
all of the constant region genes and enhancers are located within
a relatively small 300 kb region. In contrast, the 195 VH genes, of
which ~100 were deemed to be functional, are spread out over
~2.5 Mb. To create the greatest combinatorial diversity, all V genes
would have to be able to access the DH and JH genes relatively
equally regardless of their genomic distance. The question is then,
how is this equality achieved?

With growing appreciation for how three-dimensional struc-
tural changes at the locus may bring V genes into proximity of the
(D)J rearrangement to which one V gene will ultimately rearrange,
current studies are employing cutting edge technologies to fur-
ther understand this process. Chromatin conformation capture
(3C) and its more recent modiﬁcations, 4C, 5C, and Hi-C (1–3),
have allowed the identiﬁcation of long-range chromosomal inter-
actions, which facilitate the rearrangement of distant V genes by

making critical connections between the V genes and enhancers
downstream (4). Next generation sequencing technologies cou-
pled with chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) (ChIP-seq)
have allowed us to determine the binding sites of transcription
factors throughout the genome as well as the genome-wide epi-
genetic landscape. Deep sequencing of RNA reveals the entire
transcriptional proﬁle of cells for both coding and non-coding
RNA (ncRNA). Together, these techniques supply us with a bounty
of information regarding the transcriptional and epigenetic proﬁle
of AgR loci at varying stages of differentiation. In this review, we
will summarize and discuss how these recent studies have advanced
our understanding of how long-range chromatin interactions and
epigenetic changes may regulate V(D)J recombination at mouse
AgR loci.

AgR LOCI UNDERGO LARGE SCALE THREE-DIMENSIONAL
CONFORMATIONAL CHANGES DURING V(D)J
REARRANGEMENT
All B cell and T cell receptor (BCR, TCR) subunits are formed
through the process of V(D)J recombination. The BCR consists of
two immunoglobulin heavy chains (Igh) and two identical light
chains encoded by either the kappa (Igκ) or lambda (Igλ) loci. The
TCR alpha (Tcrα) and beta (Tcrβ), or delta (Tcrδ) and gamma
(Tcrγ) chains constitute the TCR complex of the two major T cell
subsets. The Igh and Igκ are of similarly large sizes of approxi-
mately 2.8 and 3.2 Mb, while the Tcrα/δ and Tcrβ loci are smaller
at 1.7 and 0.66 Mb. In comparison, the Igλ and Tcrγ loci are much
smaller, each only being about 200 kb. The challenge, which is
particularly great for the large receptor loci, is to give all V genes

the three larger AgR loci; Igh, Igκ, and Tcrα/δ. Pink ovals represent the non-V

a chance to undergo rearrangement in order to create a diverse
repertoire. How an AgR locus brings the V genes into proximity
to the (D)J genes to create this diversity is still an unanswered
question.

The original observations that showed three-dimensional
structural changes at the Igh locus, presumably facilitating the
creation of a diverse AgR repertoire, came from ﬂuorescent in situ
hybridization (FISH) studies (5). It was found that the Igh and Igκ
loci were predominantly located at the periphery of the nucleus in
non-recombining cell types, but were found in more centralized
locations in B cells. The nuclear periphery is generally considered a
transcriptionally silent environment and is associated with repres-
sive chromatin modiﬁcations, whereas gene dense active regions
of the genome are more centrally located (6). Using two colors
of probes at proximal and distal ends of the VH locus, it was also
shown for the ﬁrst time that the Igh locus was in a more compacted
conformation in recombining B cells. Subsequently, lineage- and
developmental stage-speciﬁc locus contraction was observed for
all of the large AgR loci: Igκ, Tcrα/δ, and Tcrβ (7–10). This process
of locus contraction is reversible, as demonstrated by the extension
of the Igh locus in pre-B cells, when Igh rearrangement is complete
(7). Contraction and re-extension of the distal end of the Tcrα/δ
locus was also observed in double positive (DP) T cells (8). At this
locus, contraction is necessary in double negative (DN) T cells for
the accessibility of V genes used in TCRδ rearrangements, but in
DP thymocytes, rearrangement of the more J-proximal Vα genes
occurs before the rearrangement of distal Vα genes, so extension
of the distal Vα genes would facilitate the ordered rearrangement
of TCR Vα genes.

Greater insight to how such large-scale locus contraction may
occur came from a 3D-FISH study by Jhunjhunwala et al. that used
multiple 10 kb probes spanning the entire Igh locus followed by 3D
computational reconstruction of the location of all the probe bind-
ing sites (11). The results showed that the locus could be divided

into three ~1 Mb compartments in pre–pro-B cells in which mul-
tiple chromatin loops formed rosette-like structures (Figure 2).
These compartments then collapsed into a single globule as cells
developed into pro-B cells. This brought the distal VH region into
closer proximity within 3D space to the DJH genes and regulatory
elements, and in fact the distal VH genes were found to be a similar
distance away from the DJH region as the proximal VH genes (11).
It has been demonstrated that locus contraction of the Igh locus
is regulated, directly or indirectly, by several key transcription fac-
tors. Mice deﬁcient in YY1, Pax5, or the histone methyltransferase
Ezh2 were impaired in locus contraction and in the rearrange-
ment of distal VH genes (12–15). Ikaros has also been implicated
in Igh locus contraction (16), but Rag1/2 is not required for this
process (5). Together, these studies suggest that contraction is a
pre-requisite state for efﬁcient recombination of distal VH genes.
Nonetheless, while AgR locus contraction is well established as a
shared process among the large AgR loci that brings distal regions
into closer 3D proximity to J genes prior to recombination, it has
not been ﬁrmly determined what factors may be executing this
task in the different lineages.

CTCF AND COHESIN BIND EXTENSIVELY WITHIN AgR LOCI
CTCF is an 11 zinc-ﬁnger protein that is the only known insula-
tor binding protein in vertebrates (17, 18). Insulators are genetic
regions that prevent heterochromatin on one side of the insulator
from spreading into the other side. They can also prevent against
positional effect variegation, or varied expression of transgenes,
depending upon the site of integration in relation to where the
insulator is located. Some insulators also have enhancer-blocking
activity, where an enhancer cannot activate a promoter when sep-
arated by an insulator. It is now known that insulators function
through CTCF that creates long-range chromatin interactions by
binding to other CTCF bound sites (19). In this way, a domain
is created by these chromatin loops, and activity or inactivity of

locus undergoes contraction. However, we found by ChIP/qPCR
that CTCF had a similar pattern of binding in pre-B cells and even
in thymocytes, showing that CTCF binding was not lineage- or
stage-speciﬁc (28). However, widespread binding of CTCF within
the Igh locus was not observed in ﬁbroblasts, demonstrating that
the binding was at least lymphoid-speciﬁc. We then analyzed the
binding pattern of cohesin by performing a ChIP/qPCR for Rad21,
one of the cohesin subunits. This revealed that the level of Rad21
binding was higher in pro-B cells than in pre-B cells or thymo-
cytes for many sites, suggesting cohesin may have a greater role
than CTCF in specifying the developmental stage in which Igh
recombination occurs (28).

CTCF displayed more lineage- and developmental stage-
speciﬁc binding at the Igκ locus (28). Some sites were only bound
in pre-B cells, while others showed lower levels of binding in pro-B
cells or thymocytes. Rad21 binding also displayed similar lineage
and stage-speciﬁcity at the Igκ locus. Investigation of ChIP-seq
of CTCF binding at the large TCR loci showed various extents of
lineage- and stage-speciﬁcity. At all AgR loci, however, we observed
that the binding of cohesin was highest in the appropriate lineage
and developmental stage. From these observations, it can be seen
that CTCF and Rad21 may have different degrees of function in
regulating lineage and stage-speciﬁc 3D structures at each AgR
locus.

CTCF AND COHESIN INFLUENCE THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL
STRUCTURE OF ANTIGEN RECEPTOR LOCI
To determine if CTCF made long-range loops that contributed to
the compacted structure of the Igh locus in pro-B cells, we knocked
down CTCF expression in RAG−/− pre-B cells that were cultured
in IL7 for 4 days (27). 3D-FISH was performed 4 days after knock-
down of CTCF, and the spatial distance between two probes at the
far ends of the Igh locus did increase, although not to the extent
observed in YY1-deﬁcient pro-B cells. This could be due to the
fact that while CTCF binding was signiﬁcantly reduced it was not
completely eliminated at the Igh locus in the knocked-down pro-B
cells as determined by ChIP. However, it is likely that CTCF is only
one of many factors that are involved in the compacted structure
of the Igh locus.

Further insight into the contribution of CTCF to the 3D struc-
ture of the Igh locus came from the 4C studies of Guo et al. (4).
They described two different kinds of loops that formed at the Igh
locus: Eµ-dependent and Eµ-independent loops. Using a CTCF
ChIP-loop assay, they showed that the proximal regions had sev-
eral CTCF-dependent and Eµ-independent interactions, spanning
a region of ~140 kb, as well as interactions with CTCF/DFL. Using
a probe in the distal J558 region in the CTCF ChIP-loop assay,
they demonstrated four sites of interaction within a 500 kb region,
about half of the number of sites seen in 4C with the same dis-
tal probe. Importantly, none of the distal CTCF-dependent loops
interacted with any other part of the Igh locus, and similarly the
loops in the proximal region only interacted locally. Jhunjhunwala
et al. previously demonstrated that the Igh locus consisted of three
distinct rosette-like multi-looped structures in pre–pro-B cells that
compacted upon themselves during locus contraction (11). Thus,
it may be that most of the CTCF-dependent loops described by
Guo et al. are local interactions that form the basic rosette-like

FIGURE 2 | The Igh locus undergoes locus contraction as cells develop
from pre–pro-B to pro-B cells. In pre–pro-B cells, the Igh locus is in an
extended conformation in a multi-loop rosette structure probably held
together by CTCF. In this stage, the D, J, C genes and the enhancers are in
one domain that is created by long-range looping of CTCF/DFL and
CTCF/3′RR. Eµ also interacts with these two CTCF clusters. This looping
creates a D–J domain, which is physically separated from the VH genes,
thus facilitating DJH before VH to DJH rearrangement. As the cells
differentiate into pro-B cells, PAIR elements and other regions within the VH
locus start producing RNA transcripts. Through sharing or centralization of
transcriptional machinery, a transcription “factory” is formed. This gathering
of all of the transcribed regions of the Igh locus in a single cell into one
location, the transcription factory, will directly result in compaction of the
locus because the strong Iµ transcript is constantly produced from Eµ,
which is adjacent to DJH. We hypothesize that different regions of the Igh
locus are transcribed in different cells, and that only a subset of regions are
being actively transcribed at any given moment, as depicted by the three
pro-B cells in this ﬁgure. Thus, in each pro-B cell, different segments of the
Igh locus are brought into proximity to the rearranged DJH.

the genes within the domain is insulated from the activity of
neighboring domains. In fact, CTCF has been found to play a
major role in the establishment of the higher order organization
of chromosomes genome-wide, and it is found at the boundaries
of topological domains in numerous Hi-C studies (20–22).

CTCF is aided in this domain-creating function by cohesin.
Cohesin’s only known function until a few years ago was to hold
sister chromatids together during mitosis by forming a ring around
the sister chromatids with its four protein subunits (23). Now it
is well recognized that cohesin is bound to many active CTCF
sites, and thought to reinforce the loops created by the long-range
CTCF–CTCF binding (24–26).

Because of the capability of CTCF to form long-range loops,
we hypothesized that if CTCF were present at many sites in the
AgR loci, it may play a role in determining the 3D structure of the
loci and could possibly even inﬂuence locus contraction. Thus,
we performed ChIP-chip, and subsequently ChIP-seq, to demon-
strate that indeed CTCF was bound at numerous sites within the
Ig loci, and was therefore an excellent candidate for creating multi-
ple long-range loops (27, 28). If CTCF also had an important role
in locus contraction, then we would predict that it would only be
bound to the Igh locus in pro-B cells, the stage at which the Igh

loops within the Igh locus. In addition to CTCF-mediated loops,
locus contraction results from further large-scale interactions of
these rosettes that are dependent upon Eµ. It may be that the
longer range interactions require other key transcription factors
such as YY1 and Pax5. YY1 binds to Eµ, and Pax5 binds to PAIR
elements, the sites of greatest antisense transcription (29, 30).
Whether these are the regions of most importance for YY1 and
Pax5 binding with regard to locus contraction, or whether their
primary inﬂuence is indirect, is not known. Our previous results
that showed an increase in spatial distance between the two ends
of the Igh locus after CTCF knockdown may reﬂect a loosening of
the individual rosette structures while still being held together by
other locus contraction regulating factors.

INSULATOR CTCF SITES BETWEEN THE V REGIONS AND D/J
GENES AT AgR LOCI REGULATE REPERTOIRE DIVERSITY
The Igh locus has a pair of CTCF sites 3–5 kb upstream of the last
functional DH gene, DFL16.1 (28) (Figure 1). We and others have
shown that this pair of CTCF sites (CTCF/DFL) has enhancer-
blocking insulator activity in a traditional in vitro insulator assay
(28, 31). By 3C, we have shown that CTCF/DFL loops to the cluster
of nine CTCF sites downstream of the 3′ regulatory region (3′RR)
and to Eµ (27), and this was subsequently conﬁrmed by two other
groups (4, 32). Coincidently, Jhunjhunwala et al. utilized a probe
near CTCF/DFL in their trilateration study (11), so we know that
this DH and JH gene containing-loop is located far from the VH
genes in pre–pro-B cells, but it moves in close proximity to VH
genes in pro-B cells (Figure 2). We hypothesized that this loop
creates a domain that contains all the DH, JH and constant region
genes as well as the Eµ enhancer, but excludes VH genes (27).
This would provide a physical environment in which DH to JH
rearrangement could occur without any VH genes in the vicinity.
Since the DH genes have much antisense transcription, it was
hypothesized that perhaps the function of CTCF/DFL was to
stop antisense transcription from extending into the proximal VH
genes, preventing accessibility of those VH genes (31). Indeed, dele-
tion of the entire 96 kb intervening region between DFL16.1 and
7183.2.3 resulted in increased levels of DH antisense transcription
and extension of this transcription into the proximal VH locus
(33). However, knockdown of CTCF in pro-B cells with an intact
Igh locus only resulted in extension of the antisense transcription
for ~4 kb, and the antisense transcription dropped precipitously
at the 3′Adam6 gene (27). Thus, preventing DH region antisense
transcription from extending into the VH region does not seem to
be the function of CTCF/DFL.

Importantly, Guo et al. deleted or mutated the CTCF/DFL sites,
and the consequences were profound (32). Ordered rearrange-
ment was perturbed, such that VH to DH rearrangement occurred
as well as DH to JH rearrangement. More strikingly, rearrange-
ments were conﬁned to the two most proximal VH genes. This
shows that one critical function of these CTCF/DFL sites is to allow
the creation of a diverse repertoire of Igh rearrangement, fully uti-
lizing all of the VH genes, although the mechanism by which this
is achieved is not clear (34). In addition to these striking changes,
deletion of CTCF/DFL resulted in a lack of lineage restriction, with
VH rearrangement being observed in thymocytes. Thus, two of the
basic tenets of the accessibility hypothesis, ordered rearrangements

and lineage- and stage-speciﬁc restriction of V(D)J rearrangement,
are regulated by this pair of CTCF binding sites at CTCF/DFL.

The Igκ locus has two pairs of CTCF sites between the Vκ
and Jκ genes (28) (Figure 1). One pair is within a region called
“Sis” (Silencer in the Intervening Sequence), which also contains
several Ikaros binding sites (35). When Garrard and colleagues
deleted the 650 bp Sis element in the germline (36), these mice
showed a modest preference for rearranging proximal Vκ over
distal Vκ genes, and sense non-coding transcription over Vκ genes
was also slightly increased. Much more striking was the germline
deletion of the strong CTCF sites upstream of Sis in the region
called “Cer” (Contracting Element for Recombination) (37). In
the Cer−/− mice, sense transcription over a few proximal Vκ genes
was increased modestly, but there was a very strong bias toward
rearrangement of the most proximal Vκ genes and a great reduc-
tion of rearrangement of the remainder of genes. This effect was
reminiscent of the strong over utilization of the most proximal
VH genes in the CTCF/DFL deletion mice (32). Signiﬁcantly, some
Igκ rearrangement was observed in thymocytes in Cer−/− mice
(although mainly limited to Jκ1), suggesting that the insulator
sequences downstream of the V genes in both Igh and Igκ loci
are major contributors to the lineage restriction of Ig rearrange-
ment. It should be mentioned that the Igκ locus contraction was
also reduced in Cer−/− mice, meaning extension of the locus
could be a reason for the strong bias toward the most proximal V
genes. Nonetheless, CTCF/DFL knockout mice did not display any
change in Igh locus compaction (32), suggesting different modes
of repertoire restriction at the two AgR loci.

In addition to the above studies in which the CTCF sites down-
stream of the V loci have been deleted, CTCF-deﬁcient mice have
been studied for their effects on repertoire formation. Hendriks
and colleagues examined the Igκ locus in mice carrying a B lineage-
speciﬁc deletion of CTCF (38). By expressing a rearranged Igh gene
they partially rescued development into pre-B cells. Absence of
CTCF in pre-B cells resulted in a strong shift of usage to the most
proximal Vκ genes, where most rearrangements occurred at the 10
most proximal genes within the ﬁrst ~200 kb in the knockout mice.
Vκ ncRNA were increased in this region, while the remainder of
Vκ ncRNA remained the same. Using Sis as an anchor/viewpoint
for 4C-seq, it was demonstrated that the interactions of Sis with
the 300 kb proximal region increased signiﬁcantly. In contrast, iEκ
and 3′Eκ viewpoints demonstrated that the enhancer interactions
increased with sites up to 1 Mb into the Vκ locus. However, other
than a minor decrease of interaction of 3′Eκ with the end of
the Vκ locus, the interactions of these three regulatory regions
with the distal half of the Vκ locus was unchanged. From these
results, it seems that the majority of these long-range interactions
between the enhancers or Sis with the distal 2/3 of the Vκ locus
are CTCF-independent interactions. Considering that the com-
plete absence of CTCF in the cells gave a similar phenotype as the
Cer−/− mice, the predominant effect of CTCF depletion through-
out the Igκ locus may be primarily due to the absence of CTCF
binding at Cer.

As mentioned above, Rad21 (a subunit of cohesin) binds to
CTCF sites in the AgR loci when rearrangement occurs (28, 39, 40).
Seitan et al. analyzed the role of cohesin in V(D)J rearrangement at
the Tcrα/δ locus (Figure 1) through the use of Rad21-deﬁcient DP

thymocytes (39). Because cells cannot progress through cell divi-
sion in the absence of cohesin, its role can only be ascertained in
cells that do not divide, making DP thymocytes an appropriate cell
type to study. They demonstrated that Rad21-deﬁciency resulted
in reduced long-range looping between the CTCF/cohesin sites at
TEA, the promoter of the germline transcripts of the 10 most 5′
Jα genes, and Eα that also contains a CTCF/cohesin binding site.
They also found an altered pattern of germline transcription in
the Jα region and reduced rearrangement to all but the most 5′ Jα
genes in these Rad21-deﬁcient mice.

A more detailed analysis of the role of CTCF/cohesin in TCRα
rearrangement was performed using CTCF-deﬁcient thymocytes
(40). Shih et al. demonstrated by 3C that TEA and Eα strongly
interacted in wild type DP thymocytes, weakly in DN thymocytes,
and not at all in B cells. TEA and Eα also interacted with several
proximal Vα genes and with some Jα genes, predominantly at the
5′ portion of the Jα region. In the Tcrα/δ locus, most functional
Vα genes have CTCF sites bound adjacent to the promoters, and
thus it appears that normally CTCF nucleates a hub of proximal
Vα genes, a subset of Jα genes, and the enhancer to create a func-
tional recombination center. This entire hub of interactions was
greatly reduced in Eα-deﬁcient DP thymocytes, and thus depen-
dent upon Eα. Deletion of TEA resulted in a shift of the peak
of interaction of Eα to the middle Jα genes, likely explaining the
previous observations that TEA deletion shifted the predominant
rearrangements and germline transcription to the middle Jα genes
(41). In contrast to these results in wild type mice, 3C analysis
of CTCF-deﬁcient DP thymocytes revealed a reduction in the Eα
interactions with TEA, 5′ Jα, and certain 3′ Vα genes, and the level
of rearrangement at the Tcrα locus was greatly reduced. Strikingly,
the CTCF-deﬁcient DP thymocytes showed increased Eα contacts
with the Tcrδ gene segments that are just upstream of TEA. Thus, it
appears that the role of CTCF is to promote Eα interactions with
the 3′ Vα and 5′ Jα genes, while discouraging interactions with
the intervening Tcrδ genes. 3D-FISH experiments demonstrated
that the 3′ end of the locus was still contracted in CTCF-deleted
DP thymocytes, but 3C results showed that the long-range inter-
actions were reduced for some 3′ Vα genes in DP thymocytes
in the absence of CTCF. The level of transcription paralleled the
new contacts as TEA-dependent transcription was decreased and
transcription of Tcrδ genes was increased. Notably, this pattern
of altered transcription and 3C contacts paralleled that seen in
TEA−/− mice, suggesting that it is the CTCF binding to TEA in
WT DP thymocytes that directs Eα to interact with 5′ Vα and 3′
Jα and promotes their transcription and subsequent rearrange-
ment. CTCF binding to TEA also presumably directs Eα to skip
over the more proximal Tcrδ genes and instead interact with the
5′ Vα genes further away in the locus. In this way, the function
of the CTCF-binding region at TEA resembles that of CTCF/DFL
and Cer/Sis in that it prevents interactions with the immediately
proximal genes, and instead directs interactions to V genes that are
further away, allowing the creation of a diverse repertoire of AgR.

3D CHANGES CAUSED BY NON-CODING RNA
For many years we have known that the J and C genes of each AgR
locus undergo high levels of non-coding transcription when the

locus is undergoing rearrangement (42, 43). In addition, V genes
can produce low levels of sense ncRNA (or “germline transcrip-
tion”) when they are accessible for rearrangement (44). In a few
cases it has been demonstrated that these sense ncRNAs begin at
the V gene’s promoter and stop shortly after the RSS and presum-
ably this is the extent of most sense ncRNA. More recently, ncRNA
in the antisense direction was described, and these ncRNAs are
largely intergenic and longer (45). We performed directional RNA-
seq of the Igh locus, thus deﬁning all of the sense and antisense
ncRNA within the locus in pro-B cells (29). Strikingly, there were
three major regions of antisense ncRNA, and two minor antisense
regions. The three major transcripts began at three of the PAIR
elements, PAIR 4, 6, and 11. The 14 PAIR elements, or Pax5 Inter-
genic Repeat elements, consist of binding sites for Pax5, E2A, and
CTCF. These regions have high levels of H3K4me3 and H3ac, as
would be expected since they are so highly transcribed (29). The
two minor regions of antisense ncRNA were in the proximal J558
region, the site of the originally described antisense RNA (45), and
near the J606 genes.

It is now widely accepted that transcription takes place in sub-
nuclear compartments called transcription factories, which are
clusters of RNA polymerases (46, 47). Many genes are transcribed
within each transcription factory, and often co-regulated genes
occupy one together regardless of their genomic distance, and even
genes on separate chromosomes may co-localize to the same fac-
tory (47, 48). It can be hypothesized that if all Igh ncRNA were
to be transcribed from the same transcription factory, any regions
within the VH part of the Igh locus that are being transcribed will
of necessity be brought into juxtaposition with Eµ, which contains
the promoter of the predominant Iµ germline transcript (29, 49).
Iµ is constantly transcribed and located 1–2.2 kb downstream of
the JH genes (50). This would mean that any VH genes being tran-
scribed would be close to the DJH region to which one of the VH
genes would ultimately rearrange in each pro-B cell (Figure 2).
In support of this hypothesis, we demonstrated by 3C that PAIR4
and PAIR6, the regions of highest antisense transcription within
the VH region, directly interacted with Eµ (29). We knew that
YY1−/− pro-B cells do not undergo locus contraction or rearrange
distal VH genes. With this in mind, we also showed that YY1−/−
pro-B cells did not undergo antisense transcription at PAIR ele-
ments, and their PAIR elements did not interact with Eµ (29).
Thus, it is possible that the lack of antisense ncRNA in the dis-
tal VH region of YY1−/− pro-B cells contributes to their lack of
both locus contraction and rearrangement of distal J558 genes.
We also saw a modest increase in antisense transcription at PAIR
elements in CTCF-knockdown in RAG−/− pro-B cells, and 3C
analysis showed modestly increased interactions of PAIR and Eµ.
This is consistent with the idea that these interactions are taking
place in a common transcription factory (27). By 3D-FISH, larger
spatial distances between the proximal and distal ends of the Igh
locus were seen in pro-B cells with CTCF knockdown, suggesting
that CTCF is likely assisting in forming multiple loops within the
Igh locus that “loosen” as its expression is reduced. However, the
increase in PAIR–Eµ interactions that we observed with loss of
CTCF expression suggests that CTCF is not a major player in the
pro-B speciﬁc locus contraction process.

3D structure of AgR loci

DEEP SEQUENCING OF THE Igh REPERTOIRE IN PRO-B CELLS
AND BIOINFORMATIC ANALYSES
While it is necessary to understand the effect of individual ele-
ments that regulate accessibility and chromatin structure at AgR
loci, it is likely that many different factors are acting in concert
for efﬁcient production of a diverse repertoire. Recently, our lab
and the Oltz lab adopted a bioinformatic approach with a goal to
assign weight to the various factors that inﬂuence the frequency
of rearrangement of individual V genes. To address this aim, we
correlated the sequenced repertoires of mouse Igh and Tcrβ to
ChIP-seq data for histone modiﬁcations and transcription factor
binding and RNA-seq data for ncRNA transcripts (51, 52).

For the analysis of the mouse Igh repertoire in C57BL/6 mice,
we sequenced 5′RACE-ampliﬁed cDNA from cell sorter puriﬁed
pro-B cells to determine the pre-selection repertoire (51). Because
this approach utilizes universal sequences to the 5′ annealed
adapter and Cµ on the expressed heavy chain transcript, it allows
for an unbiased ampliﬁcation of the expressed repertoire. In pro-B
cells, as expected, the VH genes were recombined at widely different
frequencies throughout the locus. We assessed the histone post-
translational modiﬁcations and transcript levels over each actively
recombined gene and observed a signiﬁcant distinction between
VH genes at the distal and proximal parts of the locus (Figure 3).
Distal J558 family genes had greater enrichment for the active
histone modiﬁcations (H3K4 methylation and H3 acetylation)
as well as higher levels of both sense and antisense transcripts,
than the proximal 7183 and Q52 families. This difference in epi-
genetic proﬁles suggests that these factors may be preferentially
more inﬂuential at the distal half of the large Igh locus. We there-
fore divided the Igh locus into four domains based on VH gene
family locations, and found that domain 1, consisting of the 7183
and Q52 families, had very low levels of H3K4 methylation and the
lowest levels of ncRNA. Domain 4, the most distal, containing all
of the 3609 family as well as half of the J558 genes, had the highest
levels of all the active histone modiﬁcations as well as the highest
levels of both sense and antisense ncRNA. Domain 3, containing
the remainder of the J558 genes, also had active chromatin marks
and higher levels of ncRNA than the proximal genes.

When the relation to CTCF and Rad 21 binding was examined,
all but one actively utilized gene of the proximal 7183 and Q52
families in domain 1 had a CTCF binding site within 100 bp, and
all but one inactive gene had a CTCF site at ~1–20 kb distance.
While at a genomic scale, a distance of 100 bp vs. >1 kb may not
be of great difference, it may be enough distinction to place an
RSS in close enough vicinity to the recombination center at the
JH region to provide a signiﬁcant advantage to a VH gene. CTCF
binding at the base of the loop at CTCF/DFL, which is proximal
to the rearranged DJH, and the base of the loop of functional VH-
adjacent CTCF sites in domain 1 would bring these regions in close
proximity. Genes in the middle and distal regions did not show this
tendency, suggesting that having a close CTCF binding site is most
important for the genes at the proximal end of the Igh locus.

We previously demonstrated that RSS quality could inﬂuence
VH gene rearrangement frequency, and demonstrated that three
different prototypic 7183 RSSs and a S107 RSS were more effective
than a J558 RSS (53). All of the J558 RSSs are much further from
the consensus RSS sequence than the 7183 RSSs. However, we also

FIGURE 3 | The Igh locus can be divided into four domains by the
epigenetic and transcriptional landscape. The local epigenetic and
transcriptional environment of each gene is plotted, with the numbers
deriving from the total number of ChIP-seq or RNA-seq reads for the 2.5 kb
region centered around each VH gene. Active histone modiﬁcations and
ncRNA transcripts were enriched at VH genes at the distal end of the locus
while proximal genes had very little of these features. Domains were
divided by the boundary of VH gene families, and bioinformatic analyses of
the various epigenetic elements suggest that genes in each domain may be
regulated by different mechanisms.

showed that other parameters can override this effect, and that V
genes with an identical RSS can rearrange at very different frequen-
cies in vivo (53–55). Results from a computational model-building
algorithm using our ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and Igh repertoire deep
sequencing data determined that having a functional RSS and an
open chromatin environment as assessed by histone modiﬁcations
were signiﬁcant factors in predicting the activity of a VH gene (51).
When just the actively rearranging functional VH genes were con-
sidered, the different domains of the VH locus had different factors
that correlated with recombination frequency. Within the proxi-
mal domain 1, proximity to the DJH genes was most signiﬁcant,
which is in agreement with the data we obtained a decade ago on
another Igh haplotype, Igha, in pro-B cells from µMT mice (53).
In contrast, at the distal domains, higher levels of active histone
modiﬁcations appeared to be most important. This greater enrich-
ment for active histone modiﬁcations at the distal VH genes may
reﬂect recruitment of these genes to the recombination center via
transcription or some unknown factor that compensates for the
disadvantages such as the distance from the DJH genes and their
poorer RSSs.

At the Tcrβ locus, Gopalakrishnan et al. took a different
approach of assessing individual Vβ gene usage by using a Taqman
assay to measure rearrangement of genomic DNA rather than the
5′RACE approach that we used for the Igh repertoire (52). This
approach is feasible at the Tcrβ locus due to the much smaller
number of V genes compared to the Igh locus. When recombi-
nation frequency was compared to 3C interaction data, there was
no rearrangement advantage observed for Vβ genes that displayed
higher levels of interaction with the Dβ1 gene, leading authors to
conclude that once the contraction has occurred at the relatively

smaller Tcrβ locus, spatial access is not a determining factor for
Vβ gene usage. However, it should be noted that all but two of the
Vβ genes are present within 235 kb at this locus, whereas the Igh
and Igκ V genes are spread over >2.5 kb. Therefore, proximity of V
genes to (D)J genes in 3D space is much more likely to contribute
to V gene rearrangement frequency in the large Igh and Igκ loci.
The bioinformatic analysis of all of the chromatin modiﬁcations,
transcriptional activity, and 3D proximity for the Tcrβ locus led to
the conclusion that having a functional RSS, higher nucleosome
depletion (FAIRE assay), and higher RNA pol II binding were good
indicators for active vs. inert Vβ genes. They also concluded, for
the actively rearranging genes, higher levels of active histone mod-
iﬁcations correlated with higher levels of recombination, similarly
to our conclusions for the domain 3 and 4 VH genes.

The results from the Tcrβ and Igh locus considered together
suggest that while generally accessible chromatin conformation
and functional RSS sequences are both important, the different
AgR loci are not governed by the same rules. In the case of the
Igh locus, even the proximal and distal ends of the locus may be
regulated by different mechanisms, which is likely due to its great
expansion over a large genomic area and hence a greater need for
locus contraction to bring the distal and middle VH genes closer.

MODEL FOR THE ROLE OF CTCF AND ncRNA IN THE
ESTABLISHMENT OF THE 3D STRUCTURE OF THE AgR LOCI
CTCF and its partner cohesin play important structural roles in
creating large domains throughout the entire genome. Within AgR
loci, there is a much higher density of CTCF/cohesin sites at rear-
ranging loci than elsewhere in the genome. We hypothesize that the
many CTCF/cohesin sites are necessary to create the multi-looped
rosette-like structure that is the basic conformation of all AgR loci.
This rosette structure makes it easier to compact various loci at the
time of rearrangement. For some V genes, such as the VH genes
in domain 1 of the Igh locus, having a CTCF site near the RSS
appears to be critical for a VH gene to undergo rearrangement,
but these VH genes are rather poor in active histone marks and
ncRNA. Thus, in lieu of these accessibility factors, being physically
tethered to the recombination center, presumably by interactions
with CTCF/DFL, is of great importance. In addition to the many
CTCF sites throughout the large V gene portions of the AgR loci,
CTCF/cohesin sites in between the V and J regions of the large AgR
loci seem to be particularly important in regulating proper V gene
rearrangements in a lineage- and developmental stage-speciﬁc
manner (Figure 1). We also propose that ncRNA, or germline tran-
scription, can directly facilitate Igh locus compaction if VH genes
or intergenic regions being transcribed are located in the same
transcription factory as the Iµ ncRNA. Since the DJH rearrange-
ment is directly adjacent to the highly transcribed Iµ, transcription
will place the DJH rearrangement very close to the transcription
factory. We hypothesize that the structure of the Igh locus is very
dynamic in pro-B cells, with different subsets of VH genes being
transcribed in each pro-B cell (Figure 2, bottom). Thus, we suggest
that the dynamic and stochastic nature of germline transcription
will physically move different parts of the VH gene locus into prox-
imity to the DJH rearrangement in each pro-B cell, and this will
provide equal opportunity for VH genes throughout the locus to
come into proximity to the DJH rearrangement. Presumably, this

same activity could take place at the other AgR loci. In this way,
the production of diverse repertoires of antibodies and TCR is
assured.
