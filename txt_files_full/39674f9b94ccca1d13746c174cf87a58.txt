Common Mistakes/Remarks

Exercise 1.4 / 2.1

if two truth tables are identical, they have the same
DNFs/CNFs

Exercise 3.3

a DNF/CNF can also: be a tautology/contradiction, a single
literal, a single disjunct/conjunct

Lecture 3

Syntactic Proofs

derivation: chain of wﬀs (derivation scheme) such that
transitions result from applying one of the derivation rules

syntactically derivable: if listed in the last line of a derivation
scheme with the assumption list only featuring lines of actual
assumptions

syntactically proven: if it is syntactically derivable using only
the derivation rules

Lecture 3

Calculus

two of the most important concepts in logic ever:

a calculus is sound iﬀ whenever we can derive ψ from some
φ1...φn in our calculus then ψ is also semantically entailed in
φ1...φn
a calculus is complete iﬀ whenever φ1...φn semantically entails
ψ then we can show that ψ is derivable from φ1...φn in our
calculus
GLCs is sound and complete

Lecture 3

Derivation Rules

easy:
∧I / ∧E (Conjunction Introduction/Elimination)
∨I (Disjunction Introduction)
↔I / ↔E (Biconditional Introduction/Elimination)
¬¬I / ¬¬E (Double Negation Introduction/Elimination)

Lecture 3

Derivation Rules

harder/less intuitive
∨E (Disjunction Elimination)
→I (Conditional Introduction)
RAA (Reductio Ad Absurdum)

Lecture 3

Auxiliary Assumptions

there can be no auxiliary assumption in the assumption set in
the end

three ways to get rid of them:
→I: assume the antecedent of the implication you need
derive the consequent using the antecedent
discharge the assumption by applying →I
RAA: assume the negation of a formula you need

derive a contradiction using the assumption

discharge the assumption by applying RAA

vE:assume both disjuncts of a disjunction

derive some twice, using each disjunct once
discharge both assumptions by applying ∨E

Lecture 3

Proof Strategies

assume all premises of the argument

check if what you need is already in your assumptions, check
what you need to get it

for the conclusion of the argument and all other formulas you
need to derive, check their type and see following strategies

Lecture 3

sentence letter φ : assume ¬φ, derive contradiction, use
RAA+DNE
¬φ (any negation) : assume φ, derive contradiction, use RAA
conjunction: derive both conjuncts, use ∧I
disjunction: derive one disjunct, use ∨I or assume the
negation of the disjunction, derive contradiction, use RAA
implication: assume antecedent, derive consequent, use →I
biconditional: derive both implications, use ↔I

Examples!

(P → R) ∧ (Q → R) (cid:96) P ∨ Q → R
(A ∧ B) ∨ (C ∧ ¬D),¬R → ¬C , A ∧ B → R ∨ T ∴ R ∨ T
C → (D → H), D ∧ ¬H,¬T → C ∴ ¬C ∧ T
