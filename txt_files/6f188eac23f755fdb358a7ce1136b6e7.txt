Abstract
Colicins are protein toxins produced by Escherichia coli to kill related
bacteria. They must cross the target cell outer membrane (OM), and
some must also cross the inner membrane (IM). To accomplish cel-
lular import, colicins have parasitized E. coli nutrient transporters as
well as IM and periplasmic proteins normally used to maintain cell wall
integrity or provide energy for nutrient uptake through transporters.
Colicins have evolved to use both transporters and other membrane
proteins through mechanisms different from those employed in phys-
iological substrate uptake. Extended receptor-binding domains allow
some colicins to search by lateral diffusion for binding sites on their
OM translocators while bound to their primary OM receptor. Trans-
port across the OM is initiated by entry of the unstructured N-terminal
translocation domain into the translocator. Periplasmic and IM net-
works subsequently accomplish insertion of the colicin cytotoxic do-
main into or across the IM.

INTRODUCTION
Escherichia coli bacteria can engage in biological
warfare against related bacteria by making
plasmid-encoded protein toxins called colicins,
which efﬁciently kill closely related bacteria
that would otherwise compete for
scarce
nutrients under conditions of
(77).
Colicins have different modes of cytotoxicity;
some make ion-conducting channels in the
cytoplasmic (inner) membrane (IM) of suscep-
tible cells, thereby deenergizing those cells,
whereas others enzymatically degrade RNA
or DNA in the cytoplasm or peptidoglycan
precursors
in the periplasm. Nonetheless,
all colicins must bind to and cross the outer
membrane (OM) of target E. coli. In order to
accomplish that, the colicins have parasitized
a small group of OM proteins (OMPs) whose
normal role in the life of E. coli is to serve as
transporters for essential nutrients, such as
metals (e.g., siderophore-bound iron), vitamins
(e.g., cobalamin), and sugars, or, in the case
of the porins, to allow small molecules to pass
while acting as a permeability barrier against
large foreign molecules. The mechanisms by
which these large protein toxins have co-opted
systems normally used for the transport of small
molecules across the cell envelope have been
the subject of extensive genetic, biochemical,
and structural studies, which are reviewed here.
With the exception of colicin M, which acts
in the periplasm (38), the colicins act enzymat-
ically as nucleases in the cytoplasm of sensitive
cells or as pores in the IM. The nucleases must
therefore also cross the IM barrier.

Regardless of their mode of killing, all
twenty or so colicins that have been identiﬁed
thus far share a common modular domain
structure (Figure 1a). (For recent reviews,
including details of killing mechanisms, which
are not within the scope of this review, see
References 14, 30, 58, 60, 72, 74, 85, 117.) In
the order of the steps required for invasion
and cytotoxicity, the speciﬁc functions of the
domains are (a) the middle domain, responsible
for receptor-binding (R), which binds with
high afﬁnity to cell surface receptors, thereby

transferring the colicin from the three-
dimensional
the
two-dimensional surface of the OM; (b) the
N-terminal translocation (T) domain, which
functions in transferring the colicin from its
initial binding site on the OM to or through
the periplasm; and (c) the C domain (cat-
alytic, carboxy-terminal, or channel-forming),
which carries the cytotoxicity function—pore-
forming or enzymatic (2, 50, 103, 109, 113,
121).

Colicins are divided into groups using crite-
ria related to all three of the basic steps in the
killing process (Table 1): (a) the receptor used
to bind at the cell surface (e.g., E colicins use
BtuB as their primary receptor); (b) the group
of IM and periplasmic proteins used to effect
translocation from the OM into the periplasm
and IM, either Tol (tolerant) A,B,Q,R (group
A colicins) (31) or TonB, ExbB, ExbD (group
B colicins) (32); and (c) their killing mechanism
(e.g., RNase, DNase, peptidoglycan degrading,
or pore forming). Recently, as they have been
identiﬁed, colicins have also been characterized
by the target cell translocator used to cross the
OM after binding to their primary receptor.

CRYSTAL STRUCTURES
OF COLICINS
Crystal structures have been obtained of the
colicins B, Ia, N, E3, and M (Figure 1b–
f ). These colicins exert three different cyto-
toxic functions: pore formation/depolarization
of the cytoplasmic membrane (Ia, B, and N)
(50, 109, 113), endoribonuclease (E3) (103),
and periplasmic phosphatase (M) (121). Struc-
tures have also been obtained of an iso-
lated C-terminal 175–200-residue layered he-
lical channel-forming domain of colicin A (86)
and E1 (39) and of the catalytic domain of the
tRNase colicin D complexed with its immunity
protein (46).

The extended helical coiled-coil 160- ˚A-long
R domain of colicin Ia (113), the 100- ˚A-long
R domain of E3 (103), and the 74- ˚A single
helix R domain of colicin B (50) (Figure 1)
are prominent features of the structures of the
