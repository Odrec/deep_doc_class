[...] We do this type of interviewing all  the time / because we think you can only learn 
general features of a certain culture - of a certain people - if you do do it in 
concentrating on unique cases \ you know \ you  have to start with unique cases - then 
you have to compare it and so it would be a real gift to us / if you could tell us as far as 
it poss as it is possible in a in a short time your life history / take in a account a little 
bit the special situation of being in in Wales / [...] we did not think it would be 
possible to to interview one of our teachers / we thought it might not be appropriate / 
but I think it is so interesting what you told us - so I dared to ask you \ when we have 
done the interview and we would look at it / you would get a copy and you can think if 
something is in it which you would not wouldn’t have liked to tell #us / then you can 
#probably most of it will be yes 
you tell us / you tell us and if we would use it for publication we would ask you what 
to use and what not and we would mask of course if it is especially on Nant Gwrtheyrn 
/ it will be difficult and we’ll have to talk about it \ but you can be sure I do this type of 
interviewing interviews for twenty years or so and I never did any harm to anybody \ 
that’s alright then #it’s always 
then you can be 
the first time always in there \ always the #first time \ (laughing) 
#yeah (laughing) okay then just please you know we if you tell us your life history / we 
would not interrupt you \ we would try to be good listeners - only if we cannot follow 
the line of your storytelling we would step in \ but we jot down a few notes / and later 
on / if we would have the time we would ask you about it \ but we would not like to 
cut your red thread because then it would be #spoiled \ 
#yes \ 
so be not concerned that we keep our mouth shut \ 
that’s alright you can you can it might be a lot easier if you would suit me maybe ask 
me a few questions on the way anyway \ 
yeah \ sure \ yeah \ so may would be nice if you just think back and you have to decide 
when your life history started / if it would be with something which you apparently did 
/ that you give (laughing) that you got be conceived? you know / #(laughing) 
#yes hopefully that happened (laughing) yes \ 
yeah all the your first remembrances everybody does it differently \ (laughing) 
yeah \ so right then \ well I was eh I was born eh back in 1963 / so if you were all here 
you can all send me a birthday card next month / 5th of october to make (...) if you 
want to / so I was born in a small local hospital in just outside seven miles away \ um 
I’ve got two brothers / eh one is twentyeight / the other one is twenty six / both of them 
are married / I’m I’m still looking for a wife / so if you have got any ideas on that line / 
it will be very much appreciated - it could help me a lot in this / (laughing) I was I was 
born in Glenberrel / and eh I was raised in a Welsh family / Welsh background / em 
that’s it exept for my grandmother \ eh my grandmother was Irish \ em and I had 
usually spoke English / to a certain extent with her \ but the first eleven years of my 
life / (0.580) em (2.348) as far as eh my lang the language was concerned / I did 
everything eh through the medium of Welsh \ and I didn’t know any anything else / 
exept for Welsh \ did hear a little bit of of English - and so on - but the early years it 
was certainly Welsh \ and I think but Welsh \ all my friends em and all my family / 
who lived in the area / all spoke Welsh \ so that was the natural language that was the 
only language that I knew for many many years \ #eh

as I said my grandmother was eh Irish / eh she spoke a little bit of Welsh and a little bit 
of English eh a lot of English but eh I always used to eh speak Welsh to her \ #she 
would answer  
#mhm 
to me back in in English \ 
mhm #mhm 
#but she understood everything I think she was embarrassed that her Welsh wasn’t all 
that good / but she understood everything \ em I did em the weekends when I was 
young / young a young lad I used to go up to stay with my parents grandparents / em to 
a place called Nant Gwinernth / which is just in the foots of Snowdon \ 
mhm 
and everybody in that nant village as well spoke Welsh \ so it my first years I was 
surrounded by Welsh and Welsh Welsh only really \ 
mhm 
as I grew older / maybe when I was around nine - and ten or eleven years old - em I 
stur started taking notice of you know the English language because it was eh it was 
used mainly during the summer months back in the village \ em that was when visitors 
to the area came / and they spoke eh obviously they spoke English \ so we did hear a 
little bit of English although we didn’t understand \ all of it \ I went to the local school 
in Aven / local primary school / em em I was there for seven years \ and during my 
time there em I think out of about a hundred children in the school only four or five 
were actually English at that time \ so on scan? when I was at school everything was 
done through the medium of Welsh \ 
eh when I was eleven I went to the secondary school at Mchelly / em and there em it 
was a bit of a shock because there we had to do all our subjects through the medium of 
English \ which was to a certain extent in the first few years it was very very unfair - 
personal view it was very very unfair \ em and people always used to tell us when we 
were young - eh you can never go on in the world - with just the Welsh language 
because you won’t be able to go further than maybe Bangor \ which is thirty Miles 
away \ if you grow old - look for work - you’ll have to go \ out of the area to look for 
work and definitely you’ll have to have English \ em the first two years in the 
secondary school / we did as much work in French as we did in in Welsh \ we only had 
the one Welsh lesson \ that was the only time we did any work through the medium of 
Welsh \ we also had the same time with French \ and I told you that that was a 
complete waste of time \ em so we did all our subjects through the medium of of eh of 
English which was eh very very hard in the first first few years \ once we went to the 
(clears his throat) to the eh I think with eh thirteen fourteen we went to another school 
in Mchelly / em and there was there was a lot more English coming into the school \ a 
lot more English families moving into the area \ em and it was very - how can I say \ it 
was very very it was a sad time because eh a lot of my friends started to speak a lot 
more English \ em there were a lot more English students coming into the school - em 
a lot more English families moving into the area - and generally the Welsh language 
was being maybe pushed to one side / em the English language was certainly taking 
over \ and eh it was it was hard I think \ because people were kind of doing away with 
the Welsh language \ em lots lots of people believed that the Welsh language was 
dying \ and that in a few years time you know the Welsh would be like Latin \ it would 
be dead \ kind of thing \ lots of people talked like that in especially in the seventies \ 
em but I had the chance when I was in the sixth year to eh do my A levels / and go go 
on to University \ but I decided to eh drop out when I was: in the first year \ in the sixth 
sixth year \ I decided to drop out and look for work I thought working would bring out

into the big world would be a good idea at the time \ maybe I should have stayed for 
another couple of years but eh it was eh wise iss diss this issue at that time \ em I then 
went to the local worked with the local government for about nine months / then went 
to work for myself \ and I was about eighteen nineteen I installed my own business it 
was lots to do with interior designing \ carpentry work and so on \ I had a couple of 
couple of eh guys working for me \ and it was all good / I was doing a lot work for the 
??? as well I was eh how to call that a subcontractor \ and I used to go around all these 
farms maybe four if I am plug in the morning I’m taking a lot of samples and that kind 
of thing \ that was interesting work \ and I actually did thee the supervisers work for 
about a year a year and a half maybe \ which went that I had about forty-five people 
working under me 
mhm 
I was in charge of forty-five people \ and at that time when I was I was only about 
nineteen twenty 
mhm 
it was eh it took me about fifteen sixteen hours that was my normal working day 
maybe it’s about sixteen 
mhm 
hours and that was very very tyring eh there was so much competition at that time 
especially in this part I worked for for work especially in this kind of work that I was 
in \ em with that people who employed say were working for maybe the price of a 
couple of pints pints of beer that was that was the what was happening in this area \ so 
I decided to eh move out and the main idea I had was to go on travel see the world a 
bit \ a:nd eh I ended up here anyway \ a few of my friends said that they were going to 
come to Nant Gwrtheyrn for a few months to work / because they were redoing the 
houses here - rebuilding the houses it was a bit of an adventure / and all above it was 
good about it was that we were I think there was about eleven of us all together or 
eighteen two gangs there worked and it was about nine or eleven of us in each gang \ 
and it was good because everybody here was Welsh \ we were all fluent Welsh 
speakers \ I moved down into that place at that time \ we don’t know much about thee 
the background of the center \ I we knew was that it was a a Welsh language center 
where people come or would come eh to learn Welsh and it was only about six houses 
I think that were complete when I first came here \ 
mhm 
I was only gonna stay for a couple of months and then disappear \ but I kind of fell in 
love with the place \ and eh I’ve been here now phh eleven and a half years now \ 
mhm 
so it’s eh it it’s it’s nice working here and I’ve seen all the when I first came here most 
of the students who came here I think they came because it was like a hobby to a 
certain extent learning the Welsh language \ eh it was regarded as being at that time it 
was people said that it was dying out but we we see different students coming here 
now \ it’s only over the last few years we’ve seen more and more people coming here 
because eh they want to eh learn Welsh because of work 
mhm 
come in come in to this sense only \ they don’t learn the the language then they gonna 
find find it very very hard to eh find the job that’s they are geared up to doing \ so I’d 
say seventy percent of the people who come here now come through their work \ em 
there are lots of people who come here they they’re under lots of pressure to learn the 
language \ and the wheel has changed really because in my early years people used to 
tell me well you have to eh learn English because can’t go further than Bangor \ and

nowadays you got to learn Welsh because without Welsh the job prospects are not all 
that good \ eh but certainly with the soc so social services the education - health to a 
certain extent -  
mhm 
and eh so on Welsh is very very important \ so that’s in about five minutes that’s my 
history as it goes so far \ as it were \ any questions on  
yeah 
when you’re six months old or anything like that / no / 
laughing 
any specific questions / 
yeah \ if you would like to ask questions please do / and if you cannot start in English 
just do it in German we can translate it \ they have understood everything but maybe 
they are hesitant to put it into English words \ what we could do eh eh eh first we could 
concentrate a little bit about on your life / and later on we could put in a little bit more 
about Nant Gwrtheyrn / you know the history of the what you told us \ eh at the at the 
old quarry \ 
that’s right \ 
eh em yeah you eh you told us about your home situation when you were born / can 
you tell a little bit more about your parents what they were doing / and eh what type of 
surrounding it was where you lived as a little child / #and eh 
#right so  
and then a little bit about the eh the primary school too how it felt to be there -  
well it’s it’s right my parents em my father was an engineer \ em and mainly worked 
on tele telecommunications / and 
mhm 
so on \ eh em when I was about eleven or twelve I think when I was about twelve 
probably \ thirteen / he was actually made redundant eh he’d been working he’d never 
been unemployed in his life \ he had always worked \ and eh my mother is she eh she 
went to a university \ em she was one of three children eh both were brothers \ who 
were working away because at that time you know work was hard to come by around 
here / one was at sea - and the other was farming \ and eh her parents her father she 
went he was he was sick when she was in the first year of university she’ll so she had 
to come leave university she and come back home to have to have her father then her 
mother was ill - and her father died - and so on / so she was kind of she had to leave 
university \ and she didn’t go back unfortunately \ but she went to work in a local shop 
in Mchelly / and that is the way she met up with my father \ em they’ve lived in I mean 
four my father came to live in Aven about forty years ago \ he died earlier this year \ he 
came to live from Nant Gwyneth which is not far from Snowdon \ about forty years 
ago \ that was my brothers were were brought up about six six years between myself 
and the second brother \ so the first six years I I suppose I was spoiled a little bit by my 
clo cose relatives and so on \ the one’s 
you were the younger one / 
I was the old the old one unfortunately \ yes \ my brothers got away my two younger 
brothers got away with doing a lot more bad things in life than I was eh I didn’t have 
the chance to do most of the things that my brothers are \ but it was eh it wa it was 
good you know it’s it was a it was a nice nice place to eh to live in Aven quiet - 
seaside town - so we had the mountains - we had the sea - we had everything really \ so 
in our early days there weren’t any big deals or anything like that \ so we used to play 
out a lot we used to all kinds of things \ you know either on the beach or and the the

little old forests and the mountains or it was it a good it was a good place to to grow up 
I suppose \ very very quiet eh very sedate kind of life \ yeah \ 
and you went to elementary school and eh how did the teachers eh do it in elementary 
school \ when you started with in the morning what was the first and #you know I 
#I think the first 
I have the image that in Welsh schools you would learn a lot of singing - and lots of 
music -  
yes we we we I was eh my mother always thought that it would be a good idea for me 
to eh t t to learn how to sing - and to play the piano - and everything like that \ and I 
did start when I was very very young em to play the piano \ and sing and do the back 
thing that kind of thing \ and in school they had a great sense of humour \ they had a 
great way of em getting us to do different things \ even things that we didn’t like \ 
mhm 
so the first you know every morning we had what we called eh assembly \ 
yeah 
eh first first thing \ eh on every Thursday em we would eh we’d do an act \ a little act \ 
as it were \ you know eh anything to do with you know with with the bible and so on \ 
that was great that was that was really good \ 
you did not have acting you mean something like a stageplay 
oh yeah \ we we used to do the stageplay every once every every month \ in our class \ 
and everybody had to do take part \ I was trying to get the legal all because you did get 
quite a bit of attention like that \ so that was that was good laugh though \ good time \ 
eh we did do lots of work on on his on nature because we were so close to nature em 
we often went down to the beach - up the mountain - collected some of the you know 
different wild flowers and this and that thing \ it was very very interesting \ football - 
and games - was one of the teachers there was marked on football so we had a football 
team - there as well \ and one of my something that will stay with me for the rest of my 
life really is eh we were going to this eh at that time it was a big it was it was like the 
world cup for us there / we were only going three miles down the road to this other 
school \ and all the the other school is on the peninsula here at Cabot there \ and half 
an hour before we were supposed to leave the teacher took his house / and gave us 
trouble sickness tabletts just in case we got sick \ we were only going down three miles 
down the road 
mhm mhm 
and he would walk us round the the school and everything like that \ and that was great 
because we we loved that because we didn’t have to work did we \ so eh that was 
excellent \ eh when I was eh my early years especially in the primary school in Aven 
were it was it was well worth getting up in the morning to go to school \ 
mhm 
it was different once I went into secondary school \ but certainly in primary school it 
was really enjoyable \ yeah \ 
mhm and then you went to secondary school and you did not tell us anything about 
ESL English as a second language you know that you would learn eh English eh as far 
as I get the idea / you you eh you were assumed to be able to speak English #in spite 
#yeah \ yeah \ we were assumed yeah \ yeah we we you know we had to work at it \ a 
lot of my friends even it’s very very hard for us / just like yourselves / it’s very very 
hard for us to express eh ourselves eh in English 
mhm 
eh em I remember (3.350) it was just before I came here \ em I went to a local college / 
in Hartleff / which is not far from here \ and I was going to do Welsh history and

Welsh economics \ a:nd I was going I wanted to it through the medium of Welsh \ and 
I went to this place and I was told that I’d have the interview in in Welsh \ well that 
was excellent \ no problem \ anyway \ when I arrived there nine people just very 
similar to this #eh this room here \ 
#laughing 
and one of them one of the lecturers was was English and he didn’t understand Welsh \ 
and the principal of the college told me that very sorry about this but you will have to 
have your in your interview in English \ and I told him I simply well I am against this 
because it’s gonna be impossible for me to express myself 
mhm 
em through the medium of English \ and it’ll be of you know it will be a big 
disadvantage for me \ and the teacher said no have to carry on \ you have to do it in 
English \ you know that was the attitude of the colleges at that time \ especially the 
college in in Harleff \ it was the same it was the same in school really \ em when I went 
to the secondary school in Mchelly \ em the first two years were great \ em to a certain 
extent \ but then you know having to do everything through the medium of o of 
English was just from a personal point of view I found it very eh mh it wasn’t hard but 
it was eh it was unfair I suppose \ because the first you know the first eleven years of 
my life eh you know eh I did everything all my school work and everything through 
the medium of Welsh / em even when we were doing English we would be taught 
English through the medium of Welsh \ you know it was it was very very hard \ eh so 
the secondary school was I didn’t didn’t even enjoy that part of my life \ not that much 
\ anyway \ no \ 
again I did not understand did the teachers in secondary school eh eh work on 
introducing you into the English language \ that you had formal teaching of English \ 
you know \ that they would eh that they would realize / that you would not speak 
English at home / so you first would have to learn it #??? 
#oh yes we had to learn English because you know I did not speak English at home \ 
yeah 
you know if I if I went out with my friends / just to play I didn’t speak English \ 
yeah 
em when we were going to a little shop I didn’t speak English \ 
mhm 
you know everything except except when we were yet at school \ that was the only 
time \ 
mhm 
em but I think they expected us really to to be able to speak English because of the 
English on the radio - the television - and so on \ papers - we didn’t take much notice I 
didn’t anyway 
mhm 
I didn’t take much notice of it \ I did I you know obviously I heard lots of English \ and 
I take didn’t take much notice \ in my early years \ em so I did I I did although we we 
most of the Welsh eh probably nine out of every ten Welsh Welsh students eh passed 
their English exams \ with high high grades \ whereas maybe nine out of ten of the 
English students failed \ or didn’t have such good marks eh in the English exams and 
so on \ so I I d I don’t know but we had to do all the history eh geography everything 
sciences through the medium of English \ and it’s different now because children 
nowadays can go to a Welsh medium school they can go they can start off in a crèche - 
they can then go to the primary school - eh secondary school and university \ and do

every thing through the medium of Welsh all the sciences \ everything \ the only 
subject that they would do in English is English \ 
mhm and how did eh eh how did eh are you able to remember how you learned 
English at all / 
I picked it up \ 
yeah \ and not from the teachers but 
to a certain extent from the teachers but it was mainly from by listening to it \ 
mhm - mhm 
but actually by listening to it \ that’s how I that how I picked English up \ 
mhm 
in the first few years it was all down to listening \ you know \ you you heard it on the 
radio - heard it on the television - em I didn’t read that much in English \ certainly not 
in my first first years \ it was eh it was all Welsh background? em so I think I I picked 
it up by listening to it \ 
mhm 
that’s how I picked up English I think \ 
mhm 
it was on being kind of we were taught the taught the rules and so on and you know 
proper English - as it were you know ??? school \ yes \ but it was all in the early years 
\ it was just listening to it \ 
mhm 
but we didn’t use it \ i it’s the same today \ if I go if I go for a drink with my friends 
tonight \ it won’t be I won’t use English it would be just Welsh \ 
mhm 
you know it’s 
mhm 
it’s because of the place it’sthe area where I live I suppose \ if I go fishing - if I go 
playing football - if I play soccer or cricket or anything \ 
mhm 
then it’s all through the medium of Welsh  
mhm mhm 
and if I i i you know even if there is somebody who who doesn’t speak Welsh rather 
understand Welsh I always speak to them in Welsh \ they’ll answer them in English \ 
mhm 
but I won’t eh fainore? that that person \ who doesn’t understand any Welsh then yes I 
will use English \ 
yeah 
but there is lots of people that I talk to in Welsh were other people only talk English to 
them \ they understand Welsh \ it’s just that they won’t speak it \ that’s why I’ll I’ll just 
speak Welsh to them \ 
yeah 
but in the early years it only listening to it \ picking it up \ that’s how it was \ 
#when you 
#as far as I can remember anyway \ 
yeah \ when you eh when you went out of secondary school / em eh you decided to go 
to work and not to go to college or to university \ is that correct / 
yeah I was yeah I was yeah I was thinking going to a to a drama college \ 
yeah \ ah yeah \ 
in in Cardiff \ em and I I should have done that \ that was that one that was probably 
the biggest mistake I’ve ever done so far \

yeah \ 
I should have gone \  
and how did it happen that you did not do this / 
(1.730) em (1.716) I was eh (1.308) I I I don’t know \ I don’t know what happened \ I 
just wan I think I wanted to work \ I wanted to earn some money \ wanted to have 
some money in my pocket \ em because I wanted to do different things \ so I I couldn’t 
I couldn’t see myself in college for maybe three or four years without any money and 
having a big overdraft and what have you \ em I still got a big overdraft today but the 
thing was it ti was a mistake that I did \ it’s the only thing that I regret \ you know \ in 
life so far anyway \ or one of the things that I regret \ it’s not going to the college in 
Cardiff \ when I had the chance to go \ 
yeah \ 
em (1.132) but never mind (1.031) it’s a (2.179) it’s (1.353) I just decided to go to 
work I suppose 
yeah \ are you still doing some stage playing / 
I’ve I’ve done yeah \ I’ve eh we used to do \ because it it all goes back to to the days in 
the local school in Aven \ because eh it was such a great fun when we were doing all 
these little plays - and acts - and so on - em and it was all it’s it I I think it’s it’s a great 
way of eh I don’t know really relaxing I suppose \ it’s good fun \ especially when we 
were em rehearsing we always used to have a good laughing \ we used to take the 
Mickey out of everybody \ 
mhm 
and it was it was a good way of getting to know people \ em but once we went to the 
secondary school / we we didn’t for the first two years \ and I used to write plays - 
especially comedy sketches \ first two years I used children you know my classmates 
would come up to me and ask me if I were willing to do us a little play because we had 
a Welsh lesson Welsh double? lesson \ where we had an hour of on a friday \ and 
(1.429) four or five will be in a group and we all had to do a different sketch \ so it be 
about probably about six or seven sketches \ comedy sketches \ and after the first 
month or so I was writung all the sketches down for the rest of the class \ 
yeah (laughing) 
and (laughing) that was great \ but once we went to the other school then / from the 
third year upwards \ to the sixth form \ we didn’t do that \ we didn’t have the chance to 
do that \ so eh I think about three years ago I did the prediction? with the local that was 
I had to travel thirty miles to rehearse with this eh with this company in Bangor \ and 
we did in the theatre theatre Gwynerth which is the main theatre \  
#yeah 
#yeah \ and eh I was it was all to do about it was very very heavy kind of play \ it was 
all to do about the effects of of drugs \ on a Welsh family \ really really Welsh family 
\ and the effects of drugs \ just not on the person \ the single person \ but all the entire 
family \ and it was good \ but it was the first time that I had done any acting in I don’t 
know I was fifteen sixteen seventeen years I suppose \ and the the whole place was full 
\ you know it was about full of people there \ it was good \ that was great \ that was 
eight of us in the cast all together \ and all the others had all done previous work \ and 
had done some work on TV and that kind of thing \ and it was it was it was eh it was 
interesting \ it’s a nice life I think so \  
mhm 
I’d like to do that kind of work \ that would be good \ 
mhm as school children did you have to show these little sketches on eisteddfods /

eh yes we had our own eisteddfods \ I wen I I (1.533) because the influence of my 
mother eh I had to eh (1.301) she told me that it was a good idea for me to do eh do eh 
singing - and that kind if thing \ so eh I actually took part in the national eisteddfod 
with a couple of things we had that was the choir the main choir back in nineteen 
seventy-five when it was in Quicketh not far from here \ I was in the choir and we I 
was singing another ca what we call a catabands? eh group and we got first wizards 
and something else - some literature work we did \ but all my friend started call calling 
me what we call a pun son? pun sonning? is Welsh for how can you say somebody 
who is a bit (whistles) 
mhm 
laughing so once once once people started calling me those kind of names then I 
decided that seemingly playing the piano wasn’t for me \ so I kind of packed it in when 
I was about eleven or twelve years old \ a little thing that I regret now because yeah 
(1.363) it was being good (0.976) to play the piano - and probably to sing - but that 
was the kind of eh life that we lived round here \ you know \ if you did do that kind of 
thing - I suppose you won’t be regarded as being a matter you have to play football - to 
be a a member of the gang - you know \ and we did have a lot of gangs around \ even 
in the country small villages \ you know every village had its own little gang \ it was a 
time not many years ago when you know if a certain member of a certain gang were 
about in another village so there will be trouble and that kind of thing \ so it’s it’s 
people think think of these kind of things happening in towns - cities - and what have 
you got \ eh on the peninsular here eh it’s been a lot of rivalry between people who live 
in different villages \ especially the people who live in Mchelly each other \ we got to 
ask the townies of the town people \ it’s because Mchelly a couple of years ago was the 
worst place of all the most dangerous places to go out on a fri saturday night in north 
Wales \ and it’s amazing - some of these small places - everybody from the peninsula 
would gather there on a saturday night - that’s where I went to school Mchelly \ and 
it’s interesting a lot of my a lot of my friends at school \ who spoke English rather than 
Welsh \ when they were in school \ em now they speak they speak a lot more Welsh \ 
especially who were in the local rugby site \ most of them who went there spoke 
English to start off with \ they are now with such a Welsh so many so much Welsh in 
the club - by now - that a lot of people who thought that English was (3.372) I think a 
lot of my friends thought that we would ??? actually speaking English \ when we were 
young \ and eh it’s it’s nice to go to the rugby club now \ because you see everybody 
there you know Welsh is the main language in the rugby club \ and that’s very very 
encouraging because eh most of those who actually speak most of those who are in the 
in the rugby club I remember them at school when they were in school - and they they 
always spoke English because they thought it was a that it was a clever thing to do at 
that time I suppose \ 
mhm yeah can you remember one of these situations you told in your first story line 
you told how you went on to secondary school / and then your peers started to speak 
English \ 
mhm 
can you remember such a situation / and what you what you thought then / and how 
you decided / just to get us an idea how they would splitt off to the other language \ 
(breathes hard) it’s hard to remember back \ I think when I first started using English \ 
(1.946) em (1.032) it was in the summer holidays \ 
hm mhm 
when the English visitors would come \ 
mhm (laughing)

(laughing) that was when I practiced my English I suppose \ em that’s that’s the first 
memory that I have \ em (1.456) but eh (3.521) it’s it’s hard to remember \ but I I 
suppose that was the that was the yeah (1.456) the only time I suppose \ outside of 
school \ that I would use English \ 
mhm 
that’s when the English visitors and especially the you know the the English girls 
came down \ 
mhm 
(laughing) that was em em anyway \ that was that was when we started \ practicing our 
English I suppose \ 
#mhm 
#yeah \ #yeah outside of school \ 
#yeah I mean a situation you know when your friends started to to speak English \ and 
#you know 
#that that 
that you felt maybe some so some sort of alienated \ because they they #started to 
speak English 
#yeah they they thought they were clever 
mhm 
speaking English \ em that’s that’s what it was \ #they actually thought 
#(incomprehensible) 
they they actually thought they were better than 
yeah 
they thought that the English people were better than the Welsh people \ I suppose \ to 
a certain extent \ and they they wanted to eh (1.514) em they wanted to be apart of that 
\ whatever it was \ em I think that’s why most of them (1.575) started using English 
rather than Welsh \ it started when we went to thee the school in Mchelly\ 
yeah 
em I think (1.105) that was when I first saw some of my friends (0.542) using a lot 
more English then (0.650) than they used to \ #you know 
#mhm 
I didn’t use to speak English \ 
did you have discussions with them about it / 
em (1.905) not at that time \ 
mhm 
(1.223) I have since \ em as I said \ you know a lot of them now you know they they 
they don’t speak \ em (0.850) you know (0.846) I used to go up to la lot of them and 
they would only they would answer me back (1.368) in English - 
hm hm 
I would talk to them in Welsh - (0.516) and they would answer me back in English - 
and I thought that was (0.640) that was really bad \ (1.399) em but I think the biggest 
thing that (0.433) that (0.237) that hit me (0.299) over the last few years (0.733) is one 
of my (0.645) closest friends (1.187) em (0.837) used to be very very ()0.728) close 
friend of mine (1.198) em (1.890) and he (2.450) went off (1.105) on his holidays with 
(0.550) (clears his throat) (0.407) a group of our friends - and they were all Welsh 
speaking - and they met met up with he met up with this (0.867) English girl \ (0.475) 
and eh (1.265) he kind of eh (0.485) got on well with this girl there and - (1.704) they 
got engaged - (0.521) eh (0.774) they got married -(0.908) anyway we met up with him 
(0.624) em (3.805) a few years eh later

I hadn’t seen him for probably about three or four years (1.275) and I went up to him 
in this tour and I went up to him and said well how are you \ you know \ it’s been a 
long time \ (1.267) and he replied in English \/ 
mhm 
(very low till x) ph (0.750) (and I was up?) (0.428) you know (0.640) em (2.368) and 
he said (0.191) em (1.115) well my (0.609) wife is there \ (0.614) eh do you mind 
speaking (0.614) English \ (0.805) 
mhm 
(1.198) I said she’s over there you know she can’t here us \ well (1.905) eh (1.110) I’ll 
have to go now he said \ x and it was very very embarrassing for both of us\ 
mhm mhm 
you know \ em (0.950) because he was (0.552) when we were in the early em well 
when we were in primary school \ em (2.203) he his parents (1.063) were very very 
anti English \ (0.562) 
mhm 
(1.756) and he was anti English \ (0.939) 
mhm 
and he was throughout his school life (0.939) anti English \ 
mhm 
(0.872) he changed his name from his his surname was (1.657) was eh (0.774) actually 
pronounced or (1.141) in English \ he changed it to a Welsh version of that \ kind of 
thing \ (0.459) em (0.764) and all of a sudden (0.779) you know m three or four years 
(1.352) he (0.340) had (schnippt mit dem Finger) lost that \ 
mhm 
married an English girl and his attitude changed (schnippt mit dem Finger) over night 
mhm 
we were embarrassed you know we were really embarrassed when we had the chance 
of it  
yeah 
(1.321) em and that I think that that really hurts me a lot (1.234)  because he was eh 
(1.328) he was the last person that (0.872) I would have (0.588) thought (0.681) you 
know would would actually change (0.733) 
mhm 
it was eh (0.929) very frustrating that \ 
hm (2.476) yeah \ this leads to my last question you mentioned in the beginning in 
your introductory part that you could not manage eh to get eh to get acquainted to a 
lady and to get married / 
oh yes #yes 
#and eh you know eh my relatives come from east frisia you know and they are 
farmers / and I can remember that lots of them had difficulties to find wives for 
themselves because they wanted to go the girls wanted to go into the cities - would not 
like to stay there / eh is this something structural that you could not manage to get 
married \ because you know #it’s eh 
#no it’s eh #(laughing) 
#(laughing) 
I think it’s eh (1.234) em (1.562) I pretty like this if I if I live to be one hundred years 
old then I got sixty sixty well six years now \ so it’s been married for sixty six years it 
would be some good going you know so no I’m just I I’ve I’ve had the chance \ 
yeah

getting married a few years ago \ em but it didn’t didn’t work out so \ so I suppose I’m 
fuzzy \ 
mhm (laughing) 
eh I’ll I’ll keep myself another couple of years and not 
#(laughing) 
#and not start panicking in a big way 
(laughing) 
if I am still single when I’m thirty-six then I’ll be 
yeah (laughing) 
I’ll start panicking then but not before that \ probably enjoy my life \ enjoy life to start 
off and then to settle down \ yeah but both my brothers em my my younger brother he 
married em about two three years ago now \ but I#ve been the best man seven times I 
think \ #(laughing) yes \
