David Kellogg Lewis 

 

 * 28th September 1941, Ohio 
 † 14th October 2001, Princeton 

 

 

 

 

 materialist and reductionist in Philosophy of Mind 

 most important systematic thinker of metaphysics

states that processes of the mind are identical  
to states and processes of the brain 

defines mental states by the role they play in the 
system of which they are a part 

What is pain? 

 Identity theory:  
 
 
 
 Functionalism:  
 
 
 
 Behaviorism: 
 
 

describes states of the mind by the reactions they
cause

Lewis‘ opinion 

 

Identity Theory,  Functionalism and Behaviorism are not 

suitable to describe pain 

 

 Counterexamples: 

 

mad man and Martian 

5 

PoM Seminar - Alissa Thelen & Oliver Franz  29.04.2016 

The mad man 

 Human, but hooked up wrong 

 by doing moderate exercise on an empty stomach 

 mad man gets into the brain state of pain in humans 

 c-fiber firing: measurable change in his brain 

 

 He does not show the usual „pain behavior“: 

 no whining or groaning 

 starts doing math 

 crosses his legs and snaps with his fingers 

 no tendency to escape the situation 

6

The Martian 

 feels pain like humans, but physical realization differs 
 physical body different from humans: 

 hydraulic mind 
 fluids in inflatable cavities 
 no nerve fibers 

 his mental fluids are everywhere in his body 
 there is a heat exchanger in his head 
 when he is physically attacked, cavities in his feet inflate 

 he is in pain 

 behavior is the same as for human in pain 

 he whines and groans 
 wants to escape the situation

The problem 

 the Martian fits into behaviorism or a simple 

functionalism 

 the mad man fits into the identity theory 

 

 the other way around? 

 Martian does not possess any inner physical realization of pain 

that we could take as proof for his pain according to the 
identity theory, even though we can see his pain 

 the mad man‘ is in the brain state of human pain, but it does 
not have the same causes and consequences as human pain, 
functionalism and behaviorism would not see it as pain

How far we‘ve come 

Mad man in pain?  Martian in pain? 

Identity Theory 

Behaviorism 

Functionalism 

???? 

Yes 

No 

No 

Yes 

No 

Yes 

Yes 

Yes 

 because of Lewis examples, Identity theory, 

Behaviorism and Functionalism fail 
 

 What theory sees the mad man and the Martian 

as being in pain?  

9 

PoM Seminar - Alissa Thelen & Oliver Franz  29.04.2016 

First solution 

 Identity theory: the mad man is in pain 
 Functionalism: the Martian is in pain 

 

 solution: disjunction of both 

 
pain = pain of Identity theory   v   pain of functionalism 

 
 true for mad man and Martian 
 But:  

 ad hoc solution 
 “normal“ human is in pain according to both theories 
 

10

Lewis‘ proposal 

 „species specific identity theory“ 

 

concept of pain =  

concept of a state that occupies the causal role of pain for a 

population 

 

 

 state that occupies „causal role“? 

 what is the appropriate population? 

 

11 

PoM Seminar - Alissa Thelen & Oliver Franz  29.04.2016 

State that occupies the causal role? 

 causal role: 

 typical causes and effects of a state 

 relation to other states 

 state is caused by certain stimuli/inputs 

 being in this state leads to certain behavior 

 

 the physical state that fills the concept differs in different 

worlds 

 assigned contingently 

 mental concepts are “non-rigid” 

 

12 

PoM Seminar - Alissa Thelen & Oliver Franz 

29.04.2016 

“Non-rigid“ concept 

 Linguistic phenomenon: 

 non-rigid designator:  

 

e.g. “the president of the United States“ 

 rigid designator: 

 

e.g. “Barack Obama“ 

 

 

 “Multiple realizability” 

 concept and word of ‘pain‘ can refer to different physical 

states (in different species) 

13 

PoM Seminar - Alissa Thelen & Oliver Franz  29.04.2016 

What is the appropriate population? 

1) mankind, population of all humans 
2) population that X belongs to 
3) X is not exceptional in this population 
4) the population is natural (e.g. species) 

 4 criteria: 
 
 
 
 
 
 human:  
 mad man:  1,2 and 4 hold 
 
 Martian:  2,3 and 4 hold 
 

 

all 4 criteria hold 

3 is outweighed by the others 

 

1is outweighed by the others 

14 

PoM Seminar - Alissa Thelen & Oliver Franz  29.04.2016 

What is the appropriate population? 
 some vagueness remains 
 example: inverted spectra 

 

 subpopulation of humans that have pain an thirst inverted 
 Is an individual in pain or thirsty? 
 4 criteria 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 both opinions are fine, but one needs to decide personally 

1) 
 
2) & 3) the appropriate population is the subpopulation, 
 
 
4) 
 

he belongs to the human population and is in pain
his behavior is an exception 

the person is in a state of thirst and not  
exceptional 
he can be either in pain or thirsty, both  
populations can be seen as natural 

15 

PoM Seminar - Alissa Thelen & Oliver Franz  29.04.2016 

The Martian 

 Population: all Martians 

 He belongs to it 

 He is not exceptional 

 It is a natural population 

 

 causal role: same as for humans 

 physical state: inflated cavities in feet 

 physical state fills the role of pain for Martians 

 

 The Martian is in pain! 

16 

PoM Seminar - Alissa Thelen & Oliver Franz  29.04.2016 

The mad man 

 Population: all humans 

 He is human 

 He belongs to the population of humans 

 It is a natural population 

 

 physical state: c-fibers are firing 

 Same physical state that fills the role of pain for humans 

 causal role: differs from „normal“ causal role of pain in 

humans 

 

 The mad man is in pain! 

17

Success! 

 

 We have found a theory that works for the mad man and 

the Martian! 

 

 But: 

 Does everyone fit into this theory? 

 

18 

PoM Seminar - Alissa Thelen & Oliver Franz  29.04.2016 

Does everyone fit into this theory? 

 

What about a mad and unique alien? 

19 

PoM Seminar - Alissa Thelen & Oliver Franz 

29.04.2016 

Mad and unique alien? 

 He is an alien, so his physical state may 

be different from humans 

 Since he is mad: does not necessarily 
occupy the proper role of pain for us 

 He is unique, so his pain does not 

occupy the role of pain for others of 
his population 

 

 

 “We cannot and need not solve this 

problem.” (Lewis 1983:  129)

What is it like? / Qualia Objection 

 “If it feels[...] like pain, then it is pain[…]” (Lewis 1983: 

129) 

 it is uncontroversial that pain is a feeling 

 “For a state to be pain and for it to feel painful are 

likewise one and the same.” (Lewis 1983: 130) 

 

21

Knowing what it is like 

 Is it the same to experience something  

   and to know all about it? 

 

 Knowing what it's like is the possession of abilities: to 

recognize, to imagine, to predict behaviour by means of 
imaginative experiments 

 There is a state of knowing what it's like. No lesson, not 

any amount of knowledge can bring us there.

Pattern-recognizing automaton 

 The Database stores information and templates, which 

are a special kind of information 

 

 

23 

PoM Seminar - Alissa Thelen & Oliver Franz 

29.04.2016 

A better solution? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 No need to make templates to patterns we never saw 
before, cause we don't ‘make’ new information this way

Questions to discuss 

 What is your opinion:  

Is the mad man in pain? 

 

 

 

Is the Martian in pain? 

 

 

 Is an organism in pain without pain behavior? Think of the 

mad man compared to a person suppressing his pain 
(behavior). 

 

 Do you think everyone fits into this theory?
