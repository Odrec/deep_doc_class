Globalizing Quiescence: Globalization,
Union Density and Strikes in 15 Industrialized
Countries

James A. Piazza
University of North Carolina at Charlotte

This study examines the role played by globalization in the decline of
strike rates in industrialized countries after the 1980s. Using a
pooled, time-series multiple regression analysis of 15 advanced
capitalist countries in North America, Western Europe and East Asia
from 1952 to 2001, the author ﬁnds a relationship between
globalization – measured in terms of international trade, investment
and loosened international capital controls – and declining strike
rates, but ﬁnds that the relationship is non-monotonic and that the
level and change of union density plays an intermediary role between
globalization and labor quiescence. The ﬁndings empirically validate
earlier work by Tsebelis and Lange and Shalev, who also
demonstrated a non-monotonic relationship between macroeconomic
phenomena, labor strength and strikes.

Keywords: globalization, investment, strikes, trade unions

Introduction

Historians of industrial relations in the 1970s, in observing a marked
increase in industrial militancy in advanced capitalist countries,
speculated that the increasing frequency and intensity of industrial
conﬂict was either a cyclical ‘uptick’ spurred by stagﬂation that
would revert back to the ‘regular’ level of strikes seen in the 1950s
and 1960s or that the political and social turmoil of the decade
had permanently changed industrial relations, and that the turbulent
1970s were a harbinger of things to come1 (Brecher, 1972). Neither
was to be the case. The militant 1970s were followed by the quiescent
1980s and 1990s. Strike rates, measured as the number of working

days lost due to industrial conﬂicts per worker, fell in every indus-
trialized country and remained lower than not only the level of the
1970s but also of the 1960s and 1950s in most countries until the
beginning of the 21st century. This ominous quiescence seemed to
defy the tempo of the business cycle or short-term macroeconomic
disruptions. Table 1 illustrates this strange decline of strike activity.
Looking at the average strike rates in the bottom row of Table 1,
it is clear that strike rate levels remained fairly constant throughout
the 1950s and 1960s and after increasing during the militant 1970s,
they began to decline in the 1980s, dipping below the ‘mode’ set
between 1950 and 1969. This decline continued even more precipi-
tously during the 1990s, setting a new level of quiescence, 59.6 per-
cent lower than the previous decade and roughly 61 percent lower
than the strike rates of the 1950s and 1960s. Looking at individual
countries, the picture becomes more complex and a few patterns
emerge. The largest group of countries, Australia, Austria, Belgium,
Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Switzerland
and the UK, seem to roughly adhere to the pattern established by
