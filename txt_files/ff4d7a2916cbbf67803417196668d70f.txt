Abstract Since Flemming described a nuclear substance in
the nineteenth century and named it “chromatin,” this sub-
stance has fascinated biologists. What is the structure of
chromatin? DNA is wrapped around core histones, forming
a nucleosome fiber (10-nm fiber). This fiber has long been
assumed to fold into a 30-nm chromatin fiber and subsequent-
ly into helically folded larger fibers or radial loops. However,
several recent studies, including our cryo-EM and X-ray scat-
tering analyses, demonstrated that chromatin is composed of
irregularly folded 10-nm fibers, without 30-nm chromatin
fibers, in interphase chromatin and mitotic chromosomes.
This irregular folding implies a chromatin state that is physi-
cally less constrained, which could be more dynamic com-
pared with classical regular helical folding structures. Consis-
tent with this, recently, we uncovered by single nucleosome
imaging large nucleosome fluctuations in living mammalian
cells (∼50 nm/30 ms). Subsequent computational modeling
suggested that nucleosome fluctuation increases chromatin
accessibility, which is advantageous for many “target
searching” biological processes such as transcriptional regu-
lation. Therefore, this review provides a novel view on chro-
matin structure in which chromatin consists of dynamic and
disordered 10-nm fibers.

Introduction

There are 60 trillion cells in the human body. Each cell
contains 2 m of genomic DNA in a small nucleus with an
approximately 10-μm diameter (a volume of only ∼100 fL to
1 pL), and yet, it is able to search and read the information in
its genomic DNA to execute diverse cellular functions. There-
fore, it is important to understand how this long genomic
DNA is organized in the nucleus. In the nineteenth century,
W. Flemming described a nuclear substance that was clearly
visible after staining with a basic dye using primitive light
microscopes and named it “chromatin.” This is now thought
to be the basic unit of genomic DNA organization (Olins and
Olins 2003). Since then, even before the discovery of the
structure of DNA (Watson and Crick 1953), chromatin has
attracted significant interest from biologists. In this review
article, we assess the available data to provide a novel view
of chromatin in which “chromatin is a dynamic and disordered
10-nm fiber.”

DNA and nucleosomes

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a negatively charged poly-
mer that produces electrostatic repulsion between adjacent
DNA regions. Therefore, it would be difficult for a long
DNA molecule alone to fold into a small space like the
nucleus (Bloomfield 1996; Yoshikawa and Yoshikawa
2002). To overcome this problem, the long, negatively
charged polymer is wrapped around a basic protein complex
known as a core histone octamer, which consists of the histone
proteins H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, to form a nucleosome
(Fig. 1) (Olins and Olins 1974; Kornberg 1974; Woodcock
et al. 1976). The structure of a nucleosome is well known at
atomic resolution (1.9 Å) (Davey et al. 2002): 147 base pairs
(bp) of DNA are wrapped in 1.7 left-handed superhelical turns

fibers “30-nm chromatin fibers” (Figs. 1 and 2a, b) (Finch and
Klug 1976). In their structural model of the 30-nm fibers
called “solenoids,” consecutive nucleosomes are located ad-
jacent to one another in the fiber and folded into a simple
“one-start helix” (Fig. 2a). Subsequently, a second model of
the “two-start helix” was proposed based on microscopic
observations of isolated nucleosomes (Fig. 2b) (Woodcock
et al. 1984). The second model assumed that nucleosomes
were arranged in a zigzag manner, where a nucleosome in the
fiber was bound to the second neighbor (Bassett et al. 2009)
(Fig. 2b). In addition to these two famous structural models,
many other structural variations of 30-nm chromatin fibers
have been proposed (van Holde and Zlatanova 2007).

Fig. 1 Old and novel views of chromatin structure. A long DNA mole-
cule with a diameter of ∼2 nm is wrapped around a core histone octamer
and forms a nucleosome with a diameter of 11 nm (Alberts et al. 2007).
The nucleosome has long been assumed to fold into 30-nm chromatin
fibers (left) and subsequently into the higher order organization of inter-
phase nuclei or mitotic chromosomes. The right panel shows the novel
hypothesis of irregularly folded nucleosome fibers

around a histone octamer, whose surface is positively charged.
Each nucleosome particle is connected by linker DNA (20–
80 bp) to form repetitive motifs of ∼200 bp; this was described
originally to resemble “beads on a string” (Fig. 1) (Olins and
Olins 2003). This nucleosome fiber is also known as the 10-
nm fiber (Fig. 1). A single histone octamer in the nucleosome
has ∼220 positively charged lysine and arginine residues and
∼74 negatively charged aspartic acid and glutamic acid resi-
dues. There are also 400 negative charges in the phosphate
backbone of 200 bp of DNA. Because only about half of the
negative charges in the DNA are neutralized, the remaining
charge must be neutralized by other factors (e.g., linker his-
tone H1, cations, and other positively charged molecules) for
further folding.

Discovery of 30-nm chromatin fibers in vitro

In 1976, Finch and Klug first found, under transmission
electron microscopy (EM), that purified nucleosome fibers
(10-nm fibers) with linker histone H1 or Mg2+ ions were
folded into fibers with a diameter of 30 nm. They named these

chromatin structures. a One-start helix (solenoid), b two-start helix
(zigzag). (Top) A scheme of the two different topologies of chromatin fibers
is shown (Robinson and Rhodes 2006). Positions from the first (N1) to the
eighth (N8) nucleosome are labeled. c Two classical higher order chromatin

Manuelidis 1978) and the radial loop model (Laemmli et al. 1978). In the
radial loop model, many loop structures of the 30-nm fiber (red) wrap
around the scaffold structure (gray) (Laemmli et al. 1978), which consists
of condensin and topoisomerase IIα (Maeshima and Laemmli 2003)
