Abstract

Nine recently reported parapsychological experiments appear to support the existence of precognition. We describe three
pre-registered independent attempts to exactly replicate one of these experiments, ‘retroactive facilitation of recall’, which
examines whether performance on a memory test can be influenced by a post-test exercise. All three replication attempts
failed to produce significant effects (combined n = 150; combined p = .83, one-tailed) and thus do not support the existence
of psychic ability.

Introduction

Bem [1] reported nine parapsychological experiments designed
to test the possible existence of precognition. The experiments
involved ‘time reversing’ well-known psychological effects, explor-
ing whether participants’ responses could be influenced by future
events. Eight of these experiments obtained statistically significant
main effects. In five of the experiments, participants’ scores on a
‘Stimulus Seeking Scale’ (SSS) significantly correlated with their
scores on a test of precognitive ability. Bem ended his paper by
urging psychologists to attempt to replicate his findings and be
more open to the notion of psychic ability.

Bem’s experiments have attracted considerable controversy,
with much of the debate focusing on various statistical issues. For
example, some statisticians [2,3] have argued that Bem’s results
would not provide evidence for precognition if they were evaluated
using a Bayesian, rather than frequentist, analysis. In response,
Bem and colleagues [4] argued that the priors used in the Bayesian
analyses were unrealistically low (though see [5]). In addition, it
has been noted [2,5] that the effect size in Bem’s experiments is
negatively related to the number of participants,
suggesting
evidence of optional stopping. Finally, the experiments have been
criticised for not
the potential effects of
multiple analyses [6].

recall. The current

Bem’s Experiments 8 and 9 involved an alleged retroactive
facilitation of
three pre-
registered, independent attempts to replicate the ninth experiment,
which was chosen for two reasons. First, it obtained the largest
effect size of all nine experiments (d = .42). This was more than
double the effect size of the eighth experiment (d = .19), which had
a similar design. Second, Bem stated that it would prove among
the easiest of the experiments to replicate successfully.

participants then undertook post-test practice exercises: First, the
program randomly selected half of the words from the original list
(referred to as ‘practice’ words) and presented them to the
participants again. Second, participants
sorted these selected
words into categories, and typed them into on-screen boxes
(Experiment 8 did not include the first of these exercises, which
Bem suggested was
the reason it yielded a smaller effect).
Participants did not see the non-selected words (referred to as
‘control’ words) again. Bem found that participants had recalled
significantly more ‘practice’ than ‘control’ words in the initial
recall test, suggesting a relationship between their recall perfor-
mance and the words that they would see in the future.

Although Bem did not find a significant correlation between
participants’ performance on the test of precognitive ability and
their scores on the Stimulus Seeking Scale in Experiment 9, two of
the replications reported here employed the scale for complete-
ness. The scale was not administered to participants in the third
attempted replication due to time constraints.

When discussing the issue of replication, Bem highlighted the
importance of ensuring adequate statistical power and trying to
minimise the influence of subtle factors that might alter the
outcome of the study. In addition, it has been noted that close
replications are preferable to procedural or conceptual replica-
tions, since they allow for more accurate comparisons between
experiments and provide less ambiguous results [7]. This is
particularly true in controversial areas such as parapsychology [8].
For these reasons, each of our attempted replications used the
same number of participants as in Bem’s Experiment 9, and
employed an almost identical procedure.

Methods

During Experiment 9, a computer program presented partic-
ipants with a serial list of words, and then asked them to type all of
the words
into the computer. The

The attempted replications were pre-registered [9] and carried
out at three separate laboratories: Replication 1, The University of
Edinburgh; Replication 2, Goldsmiths, The University of London;
