Modeling Single-Neuron Dynamics
and Computations: A Balance of
Detail and Abstraction

Andreas V. M. Herz,1* Tim Gollisch,2 Christian K. Machens,3 Dieter Jaeger4

The fundamental building block of every nervous system is the single neuron. Understanding how
these exquisitely structured elements operate is an integral part of the quest to solve the mysteries
of the brain. Quantitative mathematical models have proved to be an indispensable tool in
pursuing this goal. We review recent advances and examine how single-cell models on five levels of
complexity, from black-box approaches to detailed compartmental simulations, address key
questions about neural dynamics and signal processing.

integrate-and-fire

A hundred years ago, Lapicque (1) pro-

posed that action potentials are gen-
erated when the integrated sensory or
synaptic inputs to a neuron reach a threshold value.
This
model remains one of the
most influential concepts in neurobiology because
it provides a simple mechanistic explanation for
basic neural operations, such as the encoding of
stimulus amplitude in spike frequency. However,
advances in experimental technique have shown
that the integrate-and-fire model is far from
accurate in describing real neurons. Their mor-
phology, composition of ionic conductances, and
distribution of synaptic inputs generate a plethora
of dynamical phenomena and support various fun-
damental computations (Table 1 and Table 2).

Understanding the dynamics and computa-
tions of single neurons and their role within
larger neural networks is therefore at the core of
neuroscience: How do single-cell properties
contribute to information processing and, ulti-
mately, behavior? Quantitative models address
these questions, summarize and organize the
rapidly growing amount and sophistication of
experimental data, and make testable predictions.
As single-cell models and experiments become
more closely interwoven, the development of data
analysis tools for efficient parameter estimation
and assessment of model performance constitutes
a central element of computational studies.

All these tasks require a delicate balance
between incorporating sufficient details to ac-
count for complex single-cell dynamics and
reducing this complexity to the essential charac-
teristics to make a model tractable. The appro-
priate level of description depends on the
particular goal of the model. Indeed, finding the

best abstraction level is often the key to success.
We highlight these aspects for five main levels
(Fig. 1) of single-cell modeling.

Level I: Detailed Compartmental Models
Morphologically realistic models are based on
anatomical reconstructions and focus on how the
spatial structure of a neuron contributes to its
dynamics and function. These models extend the
cable theory of Rall, who showed mathematically
that dendritic voltage attenuation spreads asym-
metrically (2). This phenomenon allows dendrites
to compute the direction of synaptic activation pat-
terns, and thus provides a mechanism for motion
detection (3). When voltage-dependent conduct-
ances are taken into account, numerical integration
over the spatially discretized dendrite—the ‘‘com-
partmental model’’ (3)—is needed to solve the
resulting high-dimensional system of equations.
For complex dendritic trees, more than 1000
compartments are required to capture the cell’s
specific electrotonic structure (e.g., to simulate
spike backpropagation in pyramidal neurons) (4).
Such detailed models also generate testable
mechanistic hypotheses. For instance, simula-
tions of Purkinje cells predicted that a net
inhibitory synaptic current underlies specific
spike patterns in vivo (5), in accordance with
later experimental findings (6). In turn, even
established models such as the thalamocortical
neuron (7) are constantly improved by adding
new biophysical details such as dendritic calci-
um currents responsible for fast oscillations (8).
A large body of morphologically realistic mod-
els demonstrates how spatial aspects of synaptic
integration in dendrites support specific computa-
tions (Table 1 and Table 2), as discussed in
various reviews (9, 10). In pyramidal cells, for ex-
ample, distal inputs are amplified via dendritic
spikes or plateau potentials, supporting local
coincidence detection and gain modulation. Den-
dritic inward currents play a major role in the
control of spiking (6) or the modulation of re-
sponses to synchronous inputs (11). Such inter-
actions among synaptic inputs, voltage-gated

Fig. 1. Examples for five levels of single-cell
modeling. Level I: Detailed compartmental model
of a Purkinje cell. The dendritic tree is segmented
into electrically coupled Hodgkin-Huxley–type com-
partments (level III). Level II: Two-compartment
model as in (23). The dendrite receives synaptic
inputs and is coupled to the soma where the
neuron’s response is generated. Level III: Hodgkin-
Huxley model, the prototype of single-compartment
models. The cell’s inside and outside are separated
by a capacitance Cm and ionic conductances in
series with batteries describing ionic reversal
potentials. Sodium and potassium conductances
(gNa, gK) depend on voltage; the leak gleak is fixed.
Level IV: Linear-nonlinear cascade. Stimuli S(t) are
convolved with a filter and then fed through a
nonlinearity to generate responses R(t), typically
time-dependent firing rates. Level V: Black-box
model. Neglecting biophysical mechanisms, condi-
tional probabilities p(R|S) describe responses R for
given stimuli S.
