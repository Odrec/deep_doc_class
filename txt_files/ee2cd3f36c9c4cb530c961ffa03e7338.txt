 coordinates with gain fields. 

Q8.2:   Explain the concept of a gain field using the example of a 

 neuron in LIP.  

Q8.3:   Explain the response properties of neurons in LIP or VIP 

 according to multimodal stimuli.

 in a combined fixation and reaching task. 

Q8.5:   How could you find out, whether the reference frame of primary 

 visual cortex corresponds to retina positions or head coordinates?  

Q8.6:   Describe the differences between egocentric and allocentric
