Î¦ Previous Session/Homework

Interdenability
Semantic Trees

If you evaluate whether Î¦ and Î¨ are semantically equivalent:
Write down Î¦ â†” Î¨, the truth table, and whether they actually are
semantically equivalent!

If you evaluate an argument:
Write down the argument, the inference conditional, the truth
table and whether it is valid!

If you translate an argument into Lprop:
When in doubt, stay close to the original sentence.

If Barney is old and disgruntled, he is unlikely to play Bingo unless
the magistrate oers a big prize.
"Î¦ unless Î¨" can be translated as Î¦ âˆ¨ Î¨ or Â¬Î¦ â†’ Î¨ or Â¬Î¨ â†’ Î¦
or any semantically equivalent formula. E.g.:
A âˆ§ B â†’ (Â¬D â†’ Â¬C )

A: Barney is old.

B: Barney is disgruntled.
C: Barney will play Bingo.

D: The magistrate oers a big prize.

Ringo cannot sing and play the drums at the same time. Instead,
Paul plays the drums whenever Ringo sings. But Ringo is not
singing. So Paul must not be playing the drums.

A: Ringo sings.

C: Paul plays the drums.

Although Mick is in the street, he dances just in case Keith plays.
As we all know, Mick's being in the street excludes the possibility
that Keith plays. So Mick cannot be dancing in the street.

Valid in Lprop.

A âˆ§ (B â†” C ), (A â†’ Â¬C ) âˆ´ Â¬(A âˆ§ B)

A: Mick is in the street.

B: Mick dances.

Interdenability

Previous Session/Homework

Î¦ Interdenability
Semantic Trees

the meaning of any connective can be specied in terms of
other connectives

all sentences of Lprop can be specied with the connectives
{Â¬,âˆ§,âˆ¨} by using the transformation rules on the next slides
all sentences with the connectives {Â¬,âˆ§,âˆ¨} can be specied
with {Â¬,âˆ¨} or {Â¬,âˆ§} by using De Morgan's Laws

All sentences of Lprop can be specied with the connectives
{Â¬,âˆ¨} and {Â¬,âˆ§} (these sets are "expressively complete").

A model of Î¦ is
an assignment that satises Î¦.

A counter-model of Î¦ is
an assignment that does not satisfy Î¦.

All of these sentences mean the same:

Î¦ is a tautology.

Î¦ is a contradiction.

Î¦ is satised under every assignment. Î¦ is satised under no assignment.

Î¦ has only models.

Î¦ has no models.

Î¦ has no counter-models.

Î¦ has only counter-models.

The Main Idea

Previous Session/Homework
Interdenability
Î¦ Semantic Trees

each branch of a semantic tree for Î¦ corresponds to an
assignment of truth values to the sentence letters of Î¦

the branches tell you what has to be true for Î¦ to be true

if a branch contains a contradiction, the corresponding
assignment does not satisfy Î¦

if all branches contain a contradiction, no assignment satises
Î¦ and Î¦ is a contradiction

A Graphical Method to Search for Models of a Sentence

Interdenability
Î¦ Semantic Trees

Building a semantic tree for Î¦:

1 apply reduction rules until Î¦ is completely reduced to positive

or negated sentence letters ("literals")

branches with contradictions can be closed immediately

2 look up which branches contain a contradiction (Î¦ and Â¬Î¦)
3 if there are branches without a contradiction, Î¦ is not a

contradiction

Semantic Trees
And Their Limitations

Previous Session/Homework
Interdenability
Î¦ Semantic Trees

with semantic trees we can only show that formulas are
contradictory or not contradictory

but "not contradictory" could mean either "contingent" or
"tautologous"

since we often want to nd out whether formulas are
tautologous or not, we use a little trick...
