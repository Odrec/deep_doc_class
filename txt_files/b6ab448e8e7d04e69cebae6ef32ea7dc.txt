Changes in Structure of the Tutorial 
 
Objectives 
• Maximize Person contact  hours with tutors 
•
• No Entry conditions for exam anymore 
• Rely on self-discipline and YOUR motivation  
• Transparency of learning material and goals 
•

Individualize the tutoring 

Learn at your own pace 
 

 
NEW Implementation  
 
We have tutorials that are as follows :  

• Twice a week – Monday 2-4 and Friday 8-10 
• Tutors will answer your question in smaller groups upon your request  
• During the tutorial we will collect important issues and will present them at the 

end of the tutorial for the entire group  

• We will upload all exercises including the solutions early in the semester – This 
allows you to learn at your own speed. BUT forces you to not only learn to copy 
the solutions if you want to really want to understand.
