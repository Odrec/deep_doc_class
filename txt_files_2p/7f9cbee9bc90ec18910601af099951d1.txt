Abstract
Agriculture is the main economic activity in Tanzania and the country´s largest employer, providing livelihood for at 
least 80 % of the economically active population. Many studies have identified key challenges facing the sector for Africa 
in general – among these lack of access to knowledge. For agricultural producers, access to knowledge is important for 
an improved productivity and competitiveness. The fast diffusion of information and communication technologies (ICT) 
such as mobile phones across Africa in the last years has resulted in an improved access and transfer of  agricultural 
knowledge. Studies have shown that rural actors like farmers in remote areas even use mobile phones for their farming 
business. Based on qualitative interviews in the Mwanza Region in northwestern Tanzania, this study aims to identify and 
categorise the different types of knowledge which are transferred via mobile phones. Our results show that mobile phones 
enlarge the ability of farmers to access business-relevant knowledge at an increasing spatial scale. However, the effects 
of the use depend on the type of knowledge and other factors. The results add to existing studies by deepening the under-
standing of the benefits of ICT on knowledge access and transfer for the context of rural small-scale framers in Tanzania.

Zusammenfassung

Die Landwirtschaft bildet für mindestens 80 % der Bevölkerung in Tansania die Lebensgrundlage, sie ist ein be-
deutender Wirtschaftssektor und der größte Arbeitsmarkt. Ein grundlegendes Problem jedoch für die Mehrheit 
der Produzenten stellt der fehlende Zugang zu Wissen dar. Der Zugang zu komplexem Wissen und Informationen 
ist vor allem für eine wettbewerbsfähige und hochwertige Produktion und Vermarktung notwendig. Die rasante 
Verbreitung moderner Informations- und Kommunikationstechnologie (ICT), wie z.B. Mobiltelefone, in Afrika in 
den letzten Jahren hat dazu geführt, dass Wissen schneller ausgetauscht werden kann. Studien zeigen, dass auch 
Kleinbauern zunehmend Mobiltelefone nutzen. Basierend auf qualitativen Interviews in der Mwanza Region im 
Nordwesten von Tansania identifiziert der vorliegende Beitrag verschiedene Typen von Wissen, die mit dem 
Mobilfunktelefon übertragen werden. Unsere Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die Nutzung von Handys den Zugang der 
Produzenten zu geschäftsrelevantem Wissen verbessert. Allerdings sind die Effekte der Nutzung abhängig von 
der Art des Wissens und weiteren Faktoren. Die Ergebnisse tragen zu einem tieferen Verständnis der Wirkung 
von ICTs hinsichtlich  Wissenszugang und -transfer im Entwicklungskontext bei.

1. Introduction and general framework

In many developing countries like Tanzania, the agri-
cultural sector plays a significant role in the national 
economy (World Bank 2009). Particularly commer-
cial agriculture can contribute to the development of 
rural regions as it creates jobs and income. To produce 
for commercial buyers (e.g. supermarkets) it is impor-
tant to meet certain requirements (e.g. a certain level 
of produce quality within a certain period of time). 
Hence, to meet such requirements it is necessary to 
have the right information and knowledge on how 
to produce commercial crops. Furthermore, market-
relevant knowledge on perishable distribution chan-
nels and actual prices is needed. The current debate 
on ICT4D suggests that crucial knowledge for farmers 
and other businesses in developing countries can be 
accessed via ICT (in particular via mobile phones, e.g. 
World Bank 2011). In the last decades, mobile phones 
have become very popular in Sub-Saharan Africa and 
are already used in remote areas by farmers for a 
rapid transfer of agricultural knowledge (Dannenberg 
and Lakes 2013). However, so far, the ICT4D debate is 
mainly based on applied studies (often by donors or 
private companies) and a deeper understanding and 
studies on what kind of knowledge can be transferred 
and accessed is missing (Heeks 2014). 
Based on qualitative interviews in the Mwanza Re-
gion in northwestern Tanzania this study aims to 
identify and categorise the different types of knowl-
edge which are transferred via mobile phones. 
Over the past years mobile phone ownership and us-
age has also expanded in rural Tanzania, including use 
amongst small scale farmers. In 2010, 56 out of 100 
inhabitants in Tanzania subscribed to a mobile phone 
compared to 57 out of 100 inhabitants in entire Sub-
Saharan Africa (Kimura and Minges 2012: 206). A few 
studies have already been conducted in Tanzania ana-
lysing the usage of mobile phones of rural and urban 
communities in general (e.g. Molony 2008). However, 
knowledge transfer and access via mobile phones as 
such has only partly been analysed. 
This paper is concerned with how different types of 
knowledge are transferred via mobile phones. From 
this perspective, we follow Humphrey (2002) who di-
vided the impacts of e-commerce on marketing struc-
tures in 1. transaction and 2. information- orientated 
exchange. The latter can be further divided, according 
to Morgan and Murdoch (2000: 160) who applied the

2.  Methodology

existing ideas on knowledge distribution to agricul-
tural networks. Based on Lundvall and Johnson (1994) 
they define simple information as information in 
terms of facts (“know-what”), while complex knowl-
edge includes different types of implicit knowledge 
that go beyond, such as “know-why” and “know-how”. 
Complex knowledge is important for the understand-
ing of production processes and involves e.g. trained 
skills, which are often implicit and therefore diffi-
cult to communicate. Yet, it is not clear which type of 
knowledge can be communicated to what extent via 
mobile phones. Therefore, this paper tries to bring 
both approaches together to examine the transactions 
and different types of knowledge that are transferred 
via mobile phones by horticultural farmers. 
This paper is based on results of a master’s thesis em-
bedded in an ongoing joint project of the University of 
Cologne, the University of Vechta and Saint Augustine 
University (Tanzania). It was partly funded by the 
German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. 
The focus of this empirical study, which was implemented 
between August and September 2013, is on small-scale 
farmers that produce horticultural products for com-
mercial use. With the help of local research assistants 
and the Agriculture Training Institute of the Ministry of 
Agriculture in Ukiriguru, 12 qualitative interviews with 
small-scale horticultural farmers were conducted. In ad-
dition, two expert interviews with local scientists were 
used to interpret and triangulate the results.
The interviews reveal actual exchange on all three differ-
ent forms (transactions, information and complex knowl-
edge). However, the extent to which this exchange takes 
place differs significantly between these various forms.  
Generally, our study shows that most farmers in the fo-
cal region have a mobile phone and use it for business 
purposes. In detail, we could distinguish the following 
different types of impact that mobile phones have:
a)  Transactions: Various transactions take place via 
mobile phones including mobile payment and the co-
ordination between buyers and suppliers. Payment 
transactions conducted via mobile phones between
