The ranges of many species have expanded at high latitudes
and  elevations  but  contracted  at  their  warm  margins  in
response  to  recent  climate  change  (Walther 
.  2002;
Thomas, Franco & Hill 2006). Changes to the distribution of
‘habitable  climate  space’  may  lead  to  extinctions  if  future
ranges are too small or isolated from current ranges, and con-
sequently the impact of climate change on biodiversity is of
increasing  concern  (Thomas 
.  2004).  The  mechanisms

that  determine  geographical  range  margins  remain  poorly
understood, limiting our ability to predict future species
distributions and to model the effects of climate change on
biodiversity (Pearson & Dawson 2003; Ibáñez 

. 2006).

et al

Climate  can  limit  distributions  directly  by  inﬂuencing  sur-
vival and fecundity, or indirectly through its effects on inter-
acting species, including food sources, natural enemies and
competitors (Gaston 2003). The prevailing view that climate
limits  distributions  directly  at  cool,  upper  latitude  range
margins is supported by considerable empirical evidence
(see  references  in Gaston 2003). An increasing number of
examples  show  how  climate  warming  has  allowed  range
expansions at high latitudes by reducing mortality (Crozier
2004; Walther, Berger & Sykes 2005) or increasing fecundity
(Davies 
. 2006). In contrast, there is little evidence for
direct climate limitation at warm margins, where biotic inter-
actions are believed to be more important (MacArthur 1972;
Brown,  Stevens  &  Kaufman  1996;  Parmesan 
.  2005).
Considering that the ﬁrst symptoms of biodiversity loss are
expected at lower elevational and latitudinal boundaries,
empirical evidence for the mechanisms that limit species
distributions in these areas is of particular importance for
modelling future species ranges and for adapting biodiversity
conservation to climate change (Hampe & Petit 2005).

Phytophagous  insects  and  their  host  plants  are  useful
model systems for testing the effects of climate and  biotic
interactions on species distributions (Hodkinson 1999; Bale
. 2002), and have provided some of the ﬁrst evidence for
et al
the  climatic  mechanisms  behind  population  extinctions  at
warm  range  margins  (Parmesan  1996,  2005;  McLaughlin
.  2002).  The  progressive  restriction  of  phytophagous
et al
insects to warmer microhabitats is a well-documented explana-
tion for the locations of cool range boundaries (Thomas 1993;
. 1999), but evidence for the reverse pattern at
Thomas 
warm margins is lacking. In this study we determine the
relative roles of climate and larval host plants in determining
distribution  and  abundance  for  an  oligophagous  butterﬂy
across a naturally occurring thermal gradient incorporat-
ing both warm (low elevation) and cool (upper elevation)
range  limits.  We  ﬁrst  determine  changes  to  the  elevational
range  of  the  black-veined  white 
  L.  after
30 years of climate warming, and test for differences between
the current range of the species and its larval host plants. We
then investigate how climatic effects on the phenology, habitat
associations and survival of 
 could cause its eleva-
tional range to be narrower than that of  its host plant. In
contrast to prevailing explanations for range margins, we
ﬁnd  stronger  evidence  for  direct  climate  limitation  at  the
warm margin of the species distribution and for host plant
limitation at the cool margin.

approximately 2 weeks, and larvae live gregariously in a silken web
from which they emerge to feed. The web is converted into a nest,
constructed from leaves and silk, in which larvae over-winter in the
second instar. In spring, larvae continue feeding in groups on the host
plant before dispersing and pupating alone (Emmet & Heath 1989).

2004–06 at grassland, scrub and woodland  sites  that  were  visited
repeatedly  to  record  regional  butterfly  distributions.  Data  for
1967–73  (Monserrat  1976)  are  butterfly  counts  at  38  sites  that

From  May  to  August,  butterflies  were  counted  on  standardized
500 m long 
 5 m wide transects (Pollard & Yates 1993). The overall
elevational range of sites was 640–1860 m asl in 1967–73, and 550–
2240 m in 2006.

time-period  at  locations  where  two  or  more  individuals  were
counted,  and  absent  where  no  individuals  were  observed.  Sites
-
where only one individual was recorded were excluded from ana
lyses,  because  sampled  butterflies  might  be  vagrants,  rather  than
representatives of a local breeding population.

To test the relation between the elevational range of 

A. crataegi
and its larval host species, the abundance of host plants was esti-
mated at each of the 43 transect sites in 2006. The route of the 500 m
transect was followed in August–September 2006 (before leaf fall)
and the number of plants of 
 spp.
that  occurred  in  the  5 m  wide  butterfly  transect  was  recorded,  to
give a density of each species per 0·25 ha (500 
 5 m). If any of the
plant  species  was  not  present  in  the  5 m  wide  transect,  then  the
transect was repeated with increasing widths of 10 m, 20 m, and up
to  a  maximum  of  50 m  width  (i.e.  25 m  on  either  side  of  the
recorder): host plant density per 0·25 ha was then estimated based
on the increased transect width. Host plant species are considered
present at a site if they were found in transects of 
 50 m wide. When
