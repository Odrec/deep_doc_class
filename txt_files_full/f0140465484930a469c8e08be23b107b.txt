I Abstract This study examined
the discriminant validity of the
German version of CBCL in two
large samples of referred and non-
referred children and adolescents
which were matched for age, sex
and socio-economic status. The
combined sample that was used for
statistical analysis consists of 2,058
referred and 2,058 non-referred
boys and girls between 4 and 18
years of age (mean age: referred
boys=10.9 years, non-referred
boys=10.9 years, referred
girls=11.3 years, non-referred
girls=11.1 years). Referral status

was used as validity criterion. Sta-
tistical procedures included Odds
Ratios, Total Predictive Values,
ROC analyses and discriminant
analyses. Results indicated that the
discriminant validity of the Ger-
man version of CBCL is compara-
ble to the original English version.
With the use of CBCL Total Prob-
lem Score as predictor (cut-off T≥
60) 83.8 % of children and adoles-
cents could correctly be classified
(sensitivity 83.6 %, specificity
83.9 %). Symptoms of the “Atten-
tion Problems Scale” show the
highest discriminative power to
distinguish between disturbed and
undisturbed children and adoles-
cents.

To  assess  child  psychiatric  disorders  two  major  ap-
proaches  are  used: on  the  one  hand, categorical  diag-
noses that describe psychopathological states as distinct
syndromes; on the other hand, dimensional approaches
that view psychopathology as a deviance from normal
with no clear threshold between subjects with or with-
out a disorder.

The  Child  Behaviour  Checklist  (CBCL)  was  devel-
oped by T. Achenbach (1, 2) for the use of dimensional
assessment  of childhood  competencies  and  psy-

chopathological problems. In the last two decades this
checklist  approach  has  had  significant  influence  in
many  countries. CBCL  has  been  translated  into  more
than 60 languages and has been used in numerous stud-
ies. The cross-cultural generalisability of CBCL was con-
firmed  in  studies  that  compared  samples  of several
countries with different cultural backgrounds (6, 7, 27).
In Germany CBCL was first used in epidemiological
studies  by  Poustka  and  Schmeck  (21, 22)  and  Rem-
schmidt and Walter (23). In 1993 a German consensus
version (3, 9) was published that has been widely used in
German-speaking countries since then. Reliability and
factorial validity of this German version has been suc-

cessfully checked (10, 11). To establish German norms a
nationwide representative field sample was drawn (12,
13). In a random-route procedure a professional mar-
keting  company  administered  the  questionnaire  to  a
representative  sample  of 3,663  families  with  children
aged  4–18  years. The  response  rate  was  82.2 %, 2,856
parent  ratings  (78.0 %)  could  finally  be  used  for  data
analysis.

One of the most common ways of employing CBCL in
child  psychiatric  diagnostic  procedures  is  its  use  as  a
screening instrument either in epidemiological studies
or  in  out-patient  settings. With  scores  on  eight  syn-
drome scales and a Total Problem Score, the extent and
severity of childhood psychological problems can be de-
scribed. As a result, evidence is given if a child or ado-
lescent needs professional help for his problem.

A common way of assessing the quality of a screening
instrument is to check criterion related validity, i. e. the
ability of the instrument to predict an external criterion
that is relevant to the constructs that are assessed.In child
and adolescent psychiatry referral status is often used as
“gold standard” to answer the question if a certain in-
strument yields enough power to discriminate and pre-
dict the clinical status of two different samples of clinical
and field populations.As Achenbach (1) points out,refer-
ral status is not an infallible criterion of children’s need
for help since there could be children in the non-referred
group that might need help but still have not received any,
and other children in the referred groups without severe
psychological problems. An alternative could be the use
of a  diagnostic  interview  to  assess  children’s  psy-
chopathology independent of the screening instrument.
However, a well-established and widely accepted diag-
nostic interview has not been available in Germany until
now.So we decided to use referral status as a validity cri-
terion.Inaccuracy of referral status could only lead to an
underestimation of the association between screening
instrument and psychopathology.

The  original  English  version  of CBCL  has  already
proven  good  discriminant  validity  (1)  which  is  con-
firmed  by  other  studies  using  the  CBCL  in  different
countries. For example, in a recent study Novik (20) de-
scribed the predictive validity of the Norwegian version
of CBCL that significantly distinguished between chil-
dren  with  psychiatric  disorders  and  non-disordered
children. In a Dutch longitudinal study Koot & Verhulst
(17) demonstrated the predictive validity of problem be-
haviours assessed with CBCL with regard to poor out-
come four years later.

McGuire et al. (19) could demonstrate that the CBCL
cross-informant syndromes “Aggressive Behaviour”and
“Delinquent  Behaviour” significantly  separate  disrup-
tive behaviour disorders from all other clinical disorders
but that this was not equally true for the prediction of
emotional  disorders  using  the  cross-informant  syn-
drome “Anxious/Depressed”.

The aims of the present study were: 1) to investigate
the ability of the German version of CBCL to discrimi-
nate between referred and non-referred children in dif-
ferent age and sex groups; 2) to examine sensitivity and
specificity  using  different  cut-offs  (based  on  German
norms); and 3) to study the predictive power of CBCL
syndromes and items.

Methods

I Subjects

The clinical sample consisted of 4,236 unselected in- and
out-patients aged 4–18 years who had been referred to
the  child  and  adolescent  psychiatric  university  clinics 
of Frankfurt, Cologne  and  Berlin  during  the  years
1987–1995. Only those parents with good knowledge of
the  German  language  completed  the  CBCL  question-
naire. All patients were clinically diagnosed using ICD-
10  criteria  (8)  or  MAS  criteria  (24)  in  a  classification
conference of two or more clinically experienced child
psychiatrists. The  following  subjects  were  excluded
from the analysis: 1) all subjects with missing data for
sociodemographic variables or diagnosis (N=961); 2) all
referred subjects who were classified as non-disturbed
(no ICD-10 diagnosis) (N=252).

The  general  population  sample  consisted  of 2,856
children and adolescents aged 4–18 years who had been
collected in the year 1995 all over Germany (12). This
sample is representative for Germany according to so-
cio-economic and urban/rural status (12, 18). Excluded
from the analysis were: 1) all subjects with missing data
for  sociodemographic  variables  (N=223); 2)  children
and adolescents of the normative sample who had been
referred for treatment in the last 12 months (N=102).

Families’ socio-economic status (SES) was classified
according  to  a  scheme  (adapted  from  Kleining  and
Moore’s (16) 9-step classification system of SES) that is
based  on  parents’ education, occupation  and  income.
For further analysis SES was summarised in three cate-
gories: high, medium and low socio-economic status.

To prevent biases in the analysis due to differences in
basic demographic variables between our two samples
we  matched  subjects  of the  referred  and  non-referred
sample for three criteria: sex (male/female), age-group
(4–11years/12–18years) and SES (high,medium,low).In
this  matching  procedure  subjects  were  excluded  (by
chance) from both samples.In our referred sample there
were more younger boys of all SES and more older boys
and younger girls of low SES than in our normative non-
referred sample. So we excluded by chance as many of
these  subjects  as  necessary  until  the  numbers  in  both
samples were the same. In the other groups (older girls
of all SES, younger girls and older boys of medium and
high  SES)  there  were  more  subjects  in  the  normative

242

sample so that subjects had to be excluded by chance un-
til both samples were matched for age, sex and socio-
economic status.

The final combined sample that was used for statisti-
cal analysis consisted of 2,058 referred and 2,058 non-re-
ferred boys and girls between 4 and 18 years of age (in
both  referred  and  non-referred  sample, 599  4-  to  11-
year-old boys, 560 12- to18-year-old boys, 460 4- to 11-
year-old  girls  and  439  12-  to  18-year-old  girls  each).
Mean age was 10.9 years for both referred and non-re-
ferred boys, 11.3 years for referred girls and 11.1 years
for non-referred girls. Socio-economic status (SES) was
also  strictly  matched  (for  both  referred  and  non-re-
ferred  sample: boys  4–11 years: 261  SES  low, 223
medium, 115  high; girls  4–11 years: 264  SES  low, 144
medium, 52  high; boys  12–18 years: 269  SES  low, 213
medium, 78  high; girls  12–18 years: 236  SES  low, 136
medium, 67 high).

ICD-10  diagnoses  of the  referred  sample  were  dis-
tributed as follows: ADHD (F90)/ADHD + Conduct dis-
order  (F90.1)  N=303  (14.8 %); Conduct  disorder  (F91,
F92) N=425 (20.6 %); Emotional disorder (F32-F39, F40-
F43, F93, F94.0)  N=737  (35.8 %); Psychoses  (F20-F29,
F30, F31, F33.3)  N=48  (2.4 %); Eating  disorders  (F50)
N=97 (4.7 %); Personality disorders (F60) N=52 (2.5 %);
Other disorders N=396 (19.2 %).

As an effect of the matching procedure between re-
ferred  and  normative  sample  (the  excess  of younger
boys with mostly disruptive behaviour disorders in our
clinical sample had to be decreased) the percentage of
patients with externalising disorders is about 10 % lower
than in a non-matched clinical sample.

I Procedure

Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) (1) is a parent-rating
scale  to  assess  various  aspects  of psychopathology  in
childhood and adolescence. The questionnaire consists
of two parts: in the first part social competence is cov-
ered by three scales: Activity Scale (amount and quality
of different activities of daily life), Social Scale (amount
and quality of children’s contact with other people) and
School  Scale  (academic  performance  in  school). The
second part is designed to assess behavioural and emo-
tional  problems  of children  and  adolescents. Parents
judge  120  items, if they  are “not  true” (0), “somewhat
true” (1)  or “always  or  often  true” (2)  for  their  child.
According to the results of various factor analyses (1)
items are grouped on eight narrow-band scales: “With-
drawn”, “Somatic  Complaints”, “Anxious/Depressed”
(these  first  three  scales  are  summarised  in  the  broad-
band 
“Social  Problems”,
“Thought Problems”,“Attention Problems”,“Delinquent
Behaviour” and  “Aggressive  Behaviour” (the  last  two
scales  are  summarised  in  the  broadband  scale “Exter-

scale  “Internalising”),

nalising”). Thirty-three items that could not be assigned
to any of these scales are called “Other Problems”. The
sum of all 120 items forms the “Total Score”.

According to Achenbach (1) syndrome scale T-scores
of 67–70 (percentile 95–98) represent a borderline clin-
ical range, T-scores above 70 the clinical range. Applied
to the Total Problem Score T-scores of 60–63 (percentile
84–90) represent the borderline clinical range, T-scores
above 63 the clinical range. We used these cut-off points
for  categorical  discrimination  between  referred  and
non-referred groups.

I Statistical procedures

To investigate the clinical utility of CBCL as a predictor
of referral  status  we  used  Odds  Ratio  (OR)  and  Total
Predictive  Value  (TPV). The  TPV  represents  the  per-
centage of cases that are correctly classified which is a
common measure of clinical utility. It has to be taken
into account that TPV varies with the base rates of the
conditions  that  are  to  be  predicted. OR, on  the  other
hand, is independent of base rates. This statistical para-
meter describes the probability of having a disorder in
the  presence  of a  risk  factor  in  comparison  with  the
probability of having the disorder in the absence of this
risk factor. We calculated ORs according to the formula:
A x D/B x C = (true negatives x true positives)/(false

positives x false negatives).

In our analysis the risk factor is “being within the clin-
ical range”. An OR of 5, for example, would stand for a
five-times higher probability of“being referred to a child
psychiatric clinic”for a child whose CBCL scores lie in the
clinical  range  in  comparison  to  a  child  whose  CBCL
scores lie in the normal or borderline range (definition of
clinical and borderline range is described above).

We also calculated sensitivity and specificity. Sensi-
tivity of a test is defined as the percentage of disordered
subjects  who  are  correctly  classified  as  disordered
(“true  positives”), whereas  specificity  means  the  per-
centage of undisturbed subjects who are correctly clas-
sified as undisturbed (“true negatives”). A further way
to determine the optimal cut-off point of a screening in-
strument is to perform a ROC analysis that helps to find
the point at which sensitivity and specificity are in opti-
mal relation to each other.The area under curve is a ROC
measure  of overall  fit  of classification  (a  score  of 1.0
would represent a perfect fit, a score of 0.5 one that is
reached by chance).A ROC analysis for each age and sex
group was performed to estimate the best cut-off point.
In  contrast  to  clinical  cut-off points  the  statistical
procedure “Discriminant Analysis” uses weighted com-
binations  of predictors  to  better  predict  criterion
groups. As the weighting procedure uses specific char-
acteristics of the sample to maximise discrimination the
accuracy of classification could be overestimated. Using

discriminant analysis in another sample could then re-
sult in lower classification rates. Two ways of correction
are possible (4): a “jack-knife”procedure (multiple com-
puting of discriminant function for each sample with a
different subject held out of the sample each time), or a
splitting of the sample in two halves so that the results of
discriminant analysis of the first half of the sample are
validated by discriminant analysis of the second half.As
the sample size was large enough we decided to use the
latter. So, by chance, the whole sample of 4,116 children
and adolescents was divided into two parts.All discrim-
inant analyses were computed twice, once on each half
of the sample.

As candidate predictors of the stepwise discriminant
analyses  we  used: a)  the  eight  syndrome  scales  (plus
“Other Problems”) and b) the 120 CBCL items. Criterion
to include a predictor in the analysis was a significant re-
duction of Wilk’s Lambda.

Results

First we analysed the ability of the eight syndrome scales
and  the  total  score  to  predict  referral  status. Subjects
with scores above the 98th percentile = T-score 70 (total
score: > 84th percentile = T-score 60) of the normative
sample are in the clinical range (1).

According to the normative procedure about 2% of
non-referred subjects are located in the clinical range of
syndrome scales and 16.1% lie in the clinical range of
the total score (see Table 1). In contrast, 18.6–38.9% of
the patients scored above the clinical cut-off point of the
eight syndromes and even 83.6% of the patients are lo-
cated in the clinical range of the Total Problem Score.

Total Predictive Value (percentage of cases which are
correctly classified) is lowest for the scale “Withdrawn”
(58.2 %) and highest for the scale “Attention Problems”
(68.8 %).With the information of all problems in the To-
tal Problem Score TPV reaches 83.8 %.

The probability of being referred is 44.6 times higher

if the Attention Problem Score exceeds the clinical cut-
off point of T > 70 but only 9.4 times higher if the So-
matic Complaints Score exceeds this threshold.

For screening procedures it is essential to know the
optimal point of discrimination between disturbed and
non-disturbed subjects. The use of CBCL Total Problem
Score  T ≥ 60  (borderline  clinical  range  according  to
Achenbach) leads to an optimal balance between sensi-
tivity (83.6 %) and specificity (83.9 %) with a Total Pre-
dictive Value of 83.8 %. With a cut-off criterion of CBCL
Total Problem Score T > 63 (clinical range) specificity
increases  to  92.2 %  whereas  sensitivity  decreases  to
69.7 % and TPV to 80.9 %.If we combine the information
of CBCL  Total  Problem  Score  (borderline  range)  and
Syndrome  Scale  Scores  (clinical  range), sensitivity
(85.4 %) and specificity (82.3%) are also quite balanced
with a TPV of 83.8 % which is exactly as high as TPV if
we use the Total Problem Score alone. The use of Syn-
drome Scale Scores alone as classification criteria does
not improve the prediction of referral status.

A ROC curve of CBCL Total Problem Score in the to-

tal sample is presented in Fig. 1.

The major co-ordinates of this curve (Table 2) con-
firm the results above. The optimal relation of sensitiv-
ity and specificity can be found at a cut-off point of 28
(T-score 59 for boys; T-score 60 for girls) which is very
close to Achenbach’s cut-off for borderline cases.

Area under curve is 0.92 (standard error 0.004) which
represents  an  excellent  ability  of CBCL  Total  Score  to
correctly classify disturbed and non-disturbed children.
Separate ROC analyses in age and sex groups show bet-
ter results with boys (0.93) than with girls (0.89 to 0.90).

analyses do not differ between the two halves of the sam-
ple. Therefore, we can draw the conclusion that the re-
sults  are  stable  in  different  samples. Of non-referred
subjects  91.9–94.6%  are  correctly  predicted  as  being
non-referred, 72.5–81.9 % of referred subjects are cor-
rectly predicted as cases. The best prediction of clinical
cases  can  be  demonstrated 
in  younger  boys
(81.4–81.9 %)  whereas  the  prediction  of referral  in
younger girls was slightly less (72.5–75.3 %).

With the use of discriminant analysis Total Predictive
Value (TPV) increases only little compared to TPV ac-
cording to cut-off points: 82.3 % (young girls) to 88.2 %
(young boys) of subjects are correctly classified. When
all  120  items  are  used  as  predictors  TPV  increases 
to  89.1–90.0 %  (sensitivity: 85.5–86.9 %; specificity:
92.6–93.2 %).

Another point of interest was to investigate the dif-
ferent ability of syndrome scores or items to distinguish
between referred and non-referred children in separate
age  and  sex  groups. On  which  syndrome  or  on  which
items do we have to focus, which of them yield the high-
est discriminative power?

To answer this question we performed stepwise dis-
criminant analyses with syndromes or items as predic-
tors.Discriminative power of variables was measured by
their  ability  to  significantly  reduce Wilk’s  Lambda. To
confirm the generalisability of the results analyses were
performed twice for both halves of the sample.

In three of the four groups (younger and older boys,
older  girls)  the “Attention  Problem  Scale” showed  the
highest discriminative power. This was true in all cases
for both halves of the sample which underlines the sta-
bility of this result. Only in younger girls the “Attention
Problem Scale” was not of such importance. In the first
half of the sample this scale was on the third place re-
garding  its  discriminative  power, in  the  second  half
there was no significant effect of this scale. For younger
girls the “Anxious/Depressed Scale” yielded the highest
discriminative  power  in  both  analyses. This  scale  was
also important for older boys and girls, but only of little
importance for younger boys. In this group the “Aggres-
sive  Behaviour  Scale” showed  the  second  highest  dis-
criminative power in both analyses. There was no sig-
nificant  effect  of this  scale  in  the  other  three  age/sex
groups. The other scales showed moderate discrimina-
tive power with differences between age and sex groups.
Only the scale “Delinquent Behaviour”did not show sig-
nificant discriminative power in all analyses.

With items used as predictors for stepwise discrimi-
nant analysis we could confirm the high discriminative
power of ADHD symptoms. The two items (8 and 45)
with the highest power to discriminate between referred
and non-referred children and adolescents cover poor
concentration and nervousness (Table 4). They are (like
items 10 and 41) part of the “Attention Problems Scale”,
the  strongest  predictor  of referral  status  for  boys  and
older  girls. The  other  items  with  high  discriminative
power  are  part  of the  “Aggressive  Behaviour  Scale”
(items  86, 3, 19, 95), “Anxious/Depressed  Scale” (items
35, 103) and “Social Problems Scale” (item 25).

Discussion

The results of our study in a combined sample of 4,116
referred  and  non-referred  children  confirm  Achen-
bach’s  (1)  findings  that  the  Child  Behaviour  Checklist
has  excellent  ability  to  discriminate  between  children
with and without mental problems.There does not seem
to  be  a  major  difference  between  the  original  English
version and the German version (9). Measures of crite-
rion-related and discriminant validity in our study were
in line with findings from other studies (1, 5, 20, 25).

The criterion in our study that should be predicted
was referral status.We are aware of the fact that being re-
ferred to a child psychiatric unit is not an ideal criterion
[using  independent  psychiatric  diagnoses  as  criterion
would be more advantageous; see,for example,the study

of Goodman et al. (14)]. Children in the referred group
without severe psychiatric problems (i. e. without ICD-
10  diagnosis)  were  excluded  from  further  analysis
(N=252), so that this possible distortion of our findings
should be of little importance. However, it is known that
a certain percentage of children and adolescents in the
general population suffer from major mental problems
without being referred to a specialised unit. Hence, we
have to assume that some of the children and adoles-
cents of our non-referred group are in reality cases with
psychiatric problems.If these were classified as cases ac-
cording to their CBCL scores, it would be a correct clas-
sification.As we do not identify these cases in our analy-
ses  they  are  wrongly  interpreted  as  misclassifications.
Regarding this possible distortion of data our results can
be regarded as a conservative estimation of the instru-
ment’s actual discriminative power because inaccuracy
of referral status could only lead to an underestimation
of the  association  between  screening  instrument  and
psychopathology.

Our different approaches to assess the discriminative
power of CBCL produced very similar results.A categor-
ical approach with cut-off points according to the clini-
cal or borderline range of Total Problem Score or Syn-
drome  Scale  Scores  as  proposed  by  Achenbach  (1)
resulted in correct classification of 80.9–83.8 % of chil-
dren. As an important finding of this study it could be
shown that the use of CBCL “Total Problem Score” alone
is  sufficient  as  screening  criterion. When  Syndrome
Scale Scores were taken into consideration, both Total
Predictive Value  and  sensitivity/specificity  did  not  in-
crease. So the use of CBCL “Total Problem Score” T≥60
(borderline range) as cut-off point seems to be an ade-
quate  criterion  for  screening  procedures  in  German
samples if an optimal balance between sensitivity and
specificity is the aim. Only 7.8 % of non-referred sub-
jects scored in the clinical range of CBCL “Total Problem
Score”(T > 63) in contrast to 69.7 % of referred subjects.
This percentage is higher than that in the study of Ka-
sius et al. (15) with only 60 % of subjects with a DSM-III-
R diagnosis in the clinical range of CBCL total score.The
enormous predictive power of the Total Problem Score

is underlined by findings of a longitudinal study by Ver-
hulst et al. (26) where deviant scores of the Total Prob-
lem Scores were significantly associated with poor out-
come six years later.

The CBCL “Total Problem Score” represents an un-
weighted sum of 120 items with emotional and behav-
ioural problems of varying severity. In this sum milder
symptoms like “wets bed”or “argues a lot”have the same
weight as severe symptoms like “tries to commit suicide”
or “physically attacks people”. A sum of mild symptoms
would result in the same Total Problem Score as a sum
of very  severe  symptoms. Remschmidt  & Walter  (23),
therefore, decided  to  use  only “critical” items  of high
clinical importance for the purpose of case definition.
Results of our study, however, reveal that, although the
items are not weighted, the sum of emotional or behav-
ioural problems is a very good marker of clinical sever-
ity.Clearly,it is unusual for high scores to arise solely be-
cause  of the  presence  of a  large  number  of minor
problems.

ROC curve analyses of CBCL “Total Problem Score”
confirm our findings. The area under curve was 0.92 for
the total sample with a range from 0.89 (girls 4–11 years)
to  0.93  (boys  4–11  years)  for  separate  age  and  sex
groups. Analysis of the ROC curve’s major co-ordinates
proves  an  optimal  balance  between  sensitivity  and
specificity at a cut-off point of 28 which is equivalent to
a T-score 59 for boys and a T-score 60 for girls according
to the German norms.The cut-off point can easily be ad-
justed to a higher or lower CBCL “Total Problem Score”
if the demands of a study require a different relation be-
tween sensitivity and specificity.

Originally,CBCL was not constructed for the purpose
of dichotomous classification of subjects but for imple-
menting a dimensional approach for the assessment of
psychopathological  symptoms. Eight  syndrome  scales
yield a profile for each subject. If the information of all
syndrome  scales  is  to  be  used  simultaneously  in  a
screening process,discriminant analysis is the appropri-
ate statistical procedure since weighted combinations of
several predictors are used simultaneously. Results of a
discriminant  analysis  are  partly  dependent  on  sample

characteristics which are used to maximise discrimina-
tion.To adjust possible distortions we split the sample in
two halves and all analyses were computed twice.

In contrast to these precautions results of discrimi-
nant analyses in the different subsamples were quite sta-
ble. The maximum discrimination resulted in very high
specificity  with  91.9–94.6 %  of non-referred  children
classified as nondisturbed and a somewhat lower sensi-
tivity with 72.5–81.9 % of referred children classified as
cases. Total Predictive Values according to discriminant
analyses  with  syndrome  scales  as  predictors  were  be-
tween 82.3 % for younger girls and 88.2 % for younger
boys. With  the  information  of all  120  items  included
TPV could be improved to 89.1–90 %.

Varying dimensions or items are of different impor-
tance. Verhulst  et  al. (26), for  example, could  demon-
strate that, besides the “Delinquent Behaviour Scale”, it
was  mostly  the “Attention  Problem  Scale” that  signifi-
cantly predicted poor outcome six years later.As a result
of stepwise discriminant analyses we can show that the
“Attention Problem Scale” yields the most important in-
formation to distinguish between referred and non-re-
ferred children. This finding is remarkable because, as a
consequence of our matching procedure, children with
ADHD are underrepresented (only 14.8 % with a diag-
nosis of ADHD or ADHD + Conduct disorder) in com-
parison with our unselected clinical sample. Thus, the

high  discriminative  power  of the  “Attention  Problem
Scale” cannot be due to a high prevalence of patients in
our  sample  with  predominantly  these  symptoms. The
only  explanation  can  be  that  poor  concentration, the
item with the highest discriminative power, is a major
problem for most of the referred subjects regardless of
their  diagnosis. Besides  ADHD, difficulties  with  con-
centration  can  also  be  found  in  psychoses, depressive
disorders, anxiety syndromes or eating disorders. Ner-
vousness or tension (the item with the second highest
discriminative  power)  and  restlessness  or  impulsivity
are also part of many other psychopathological states.As
second important syndrome appeared the “Anxious/De-
pressed  Scale” (the  most  important  syndrome  to  dis-
criminate referred and non-referred young girls).Again,
feelings of worthlessness or inferiority and an unhappy,
sad or depressed mood are part of several psychiatric
problems.

Summarising our findings we can conclude that the
external validity of the German version of CBCL is com-
parable to the original English version and other ver-
sions  from  different  countries. CBCL  “Total  Problem
Score” yields an excellent tool for screening procedures.
Symptoms of the “Attention Problems Scale” show the
highest  discriminative  power  to  distinguish  between
disturbed and non-disturbed children and adolescents.
