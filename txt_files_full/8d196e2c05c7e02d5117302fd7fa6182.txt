Translocated effectors of Yersinia
Hiroyuki Matsumoto and Glenn M Young

Currently, all known translocated effectors of Yersinia are
delivered into host cells by type III secretion systems
(T3SSs). Pathogenic Yersinia maintain the plasmid-encoded
Ysc T3SS for the speciÔ¨Åc delivery of the well-studied Yop
effectors. New horizons for effector biology have opened with
the discovery of the Ysps of Y. enterocolitica Biovar 1B, which
are translocated into host cells by the chromosome-endoded
Ysa T3SS. The reported arsenal of effectors is likely to expand
since genomic analysis has revealed gene-clusters in some
Yersinia that code for other T3SSs. These efforts also revealed
possible type VI secretion (T6S) systems, which may
indicate that translocation of effectors occurs by multiple
mechanisms.

Introduction
The genus Yersinia includes three human pathogens.
The most infamous is the black death agent Y. pestis,
which causes bubonic plague when it is transmitted by
the bite of a Ô¨Çea and pneumonic plague when it is
acquired through aerosol transmission [1]. By contrast,
Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis are enteropatho-
gens transmitted by consumption of contaminated food
or water [2]. These two organisms cause gastrointestinal
syndromes that can develop into fatal septicemia in
patients with compromised or underdeveloped immune
systems. Regardless of the species and type of disease
that ensues, translocation of toxic virulence effectors into
host cells by type III secretion (T3S) systems plays an
essential role in determining the outcome of a Yersinia
infection. There are two recognized groups of effector
proteins delivered by T3SSs among the Yersinia; the Yops
and the Ysps.

Yop effectors and the innate immune
response
Interestingly, despite the various modes of transmission
and diseases caused by the pathogenic Yersinia, they
commonly have the plasmid-encoded Ysc T3SS for the
delivery of six Yop effectors (YopE, YopH, YpkA/YopO,
YopM, YopJ/P, and YopT) (Table 1). Efforts to determine
the biochemical activities of the Yops have revealed that
many targets are cellular components that inÔ¨Çuence the
host innate immune response (Figure 1). This arm of the
immune system serves as the front line of defense against
an invasive pathogen [3]. Macrophages and neutrophils
are important elements of the early innate immune
response and serve as sentries that take up and then
inactivate invading bacteria. These cells, which act along
with other facets of the innate immune response, are
induced following the recognition of pathogen-associated
molecular patterns (PAMPS) by the family of pattern-
recognition receptors (PRRs) located on a variety of cell
types. In response to PRR agonists or PAMPS, such as
LPS or Ô¨Çagellin, signals are transduced and converged to
activate multiple MAPKs and the NF-kB signaling path-
ways. This inÔ¨Çammatory response in turn leads to the
production of numerous proinÔ¨Çammatory cytokines, in-
cluding TNF-a, IL-12 and IL-18.

Given the important role that the MAPKs and NF-kB
signaling pathways play in the earliest stages of the
immune response, it is not surprising that one strategy
of pathogenic Yersinia is to interfere with these essential
signaling components [4‚Äì6]. It is well established that
YopJ/P is a potent inhibitor of multiple MAPK and NF-
kB pathways [7]. Recent studies have clariÔ¨Åed the bio-
chemical nature of YopJ/P activity by revealing that it is
an enzyme that acetylates serine and threonine residues
in the activation loop of MKKs and IKKs [8,9,10].
This modiÔ¨Åcation effectively blocks the residues from
being phosphorylated and results in an inhibition of their
activation thereby affecting cytokine production and
inducing apoptosis of macrophages.

Phagocytosis of bacteria requires reorganization of the
actin cytoskeleton through a process that is regulated by
Rho family GTPases [11]. YopE is a Rho GTPase-acti-
vating protein (RhoGAP) that has been shown to stimu-
late GTP hydrolysis,
thereby interfering with actin
depolymerization mediated by the Rho family of proteins
[12,13]. In addition to GTPase activation, it has been
shown that membrane anchoring is also required for the
activation of RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42. Membrane anchor-
ing occurs as the result of a post-translational modiÔ¨Åcation
resulting in C-terminal prenylation at a cysteine residue.

YopT acts as a cysteine protease that removes this lipid
modiÔ¨Åcation through cleavage at a site a few residues
upstream of the prenylated cysteine [14,15]. The result-
ing mislocalization inhibits normal signaling function
[13,16].

Rho family members are further controlled by Rho gua-
nine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors
(RhoGDI).
RhoGDI binds and sequesters inactive GDP-bound
Rho family members primarily in the cytoplasm. YpkA/
YopO contains a C-terminal domain that interacts with
RhoA and Rac1 to mimic RhoGDI thereby preventing
nucleotide exchange and activation [17]. Interestingly,

YpkA/YopO also has an N-terminally located serine/
threonine kinase domain that is activated by host cell
derived actin, but its substrate remained a mystery for
many years [18]. Importantly, a group of G proteins that
respond to G protein coupled receptors have emerged as
the YpkA/YopO kinase targets [19]. In a recent elegant
study, it was demonstrated that YpkA/YopO speciÔ¨Åcally
phosphorylates Ser47 of Gaq, a key residue located in the
highly conserved diphosphate-binding loop of
the
GTPase fold [19]. This phosphorylation impairs nucleo-
tide binding and prevents Gaq-mediated cellular pro-
cesses, including the subsequent activation of RhoA that
would be expected to limit bacterial phagocytosis by cells.

Ysc T3SS found in Y. pestis, Y. pseudotuberculosis, and Y. enterocolitica. Rho family GTPases are targeted by YopE, YpkA/YopO, and YopT. The N-
terminal serine/threonine kinase domain of YpkA/YopO phosphorylates Gaq to prevent activation of trimeric G proteins. YopH tyrosine phosphatase
interacts and dephosphorylates proteins within focal adhesion complexes to inhibit phagocytosis. YopJ/P acetylates serine and threonine residues in
the kinase activation loop of MAPKs and IKKs to prevent them from activation through phosphorylation. Inhibition of MAPKs and IKKs limits expression
of proinflammatory genes. YopM traffics to the nucleus where it may affect gene transcription networks. Right side‚ÄîEffectors delivered by the Ysa
T3SS of Y. enterocolitica Biovar 1B. Presumably, YopE and YopJ/P function as described above. YopN is injected into cells but it does not have a
defined effector function. YspK interacts with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and may interfere with proteasome-mediated degradation of IkBa,
negative factor controlling the activation of NF-kB thereby inhibiting the expression of proinflammatory genes.

However, the exact role of YpkA/YopO kinase in affecting
cellular activities remains an avenue open for further
investigation since there are a myriad of signaling path-
ways affected by this Gaq group of G protein signaling
molecules.

Phagocytosis is additionally inhibited by YopH, a protein
tyrosine phosphatase that antagonizes several signaling
pathways [20‚Äì22]. YopH speciÔ¨Åcally localizes to focal
adhesion complexes where it interacts with and depho-
sphorylates proteins such as FAK, Cas, and paxillin
[21,23]. These proteins are involved in b1 integrin
mediated phagocytic events brought about by the surface
protein invasin of Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis
during epithelial cell invasion. Likewise, in macrophages,
where uptake events can be mediated by complement
receptors or Fc receptors, YopH dephosphorylates focal

adhesin complex-associated proteins,
including Cas,
SKAP-HOM, Fyb, and the FAK-homolog Pyk2 [24,25].

The remaining effector targeted by the Ysc T3SS is
YopM, which has no clearly established function. YopM
is known to trafÔ¨Åc to the nucleus when introduced into
HeLa cells. One study of the role that YopM plays during
Y. pestis infection provides intriguing clues for future
efforts. YopM function correlates with the global
depletion of natural killer cells by affecting expression
of IL-15 and IL-15Ra [26].

Ysp effectors of Y. enterocolitica Biovar 1B
While the Ysc T3SS is important for Yersinia virulence, it
is now clear that some isolates of Yersinia utilize additional
T3SSs to deliver virulence effectors into targeted host
cells. The highly pathogenic Y. enterocolitica Biovar 1B

carries the Ysa pathogenicity island (Ysa-PI) encoding a
T3SS that is distinctly different from the Ysc T3SS and is
more related to the Mxi-Spa T3SS of Shigella species [27‚Äì
29]. The Ysa-PI is part of a larger region of the chromo-
some, called the plasticity zone, containing numerous
other genes implicated in virulence [30].

enterocolitica colonization of gastrointestinal tissues during
the earliest stages of an infection [31]. This observation
brings new attention to how enteropathogenic Yersinia
colonizes the intestine and overcomes immune barriers
presented by the host at this location. It may be that the
Ysc T3SS is important for systemic stages of infection,
while the Ysa T3SS is selective for gastrointestinal in-
fection. Evaluating this model is dependent upon deÔ¨Ån-
ing and delineating the function of the virulence effectors
delivered by the Ysa T3SS.

The Ô¨Årst proteins determined to be Ysps effector by
virtue of their being substrates exported by the Ysa
T3SS unexpectedly turned out to be YopE, YopN, and
YopJ/P, three proteins also exported by the Ysc T3SS
[32,27] (Table 1). As described above, YopE and YopJ/P
are known to be effectors, but it is possible that YopN
may also have an unrecognized effector function. It was
further demonstrated that Y. enterocolitica Biovar 1B deli-
vers YopJ/P into cultured macrophages and suppresses
production of TNF-a by utilizing either the Ysa or Ysc
pathways [32]. However, gaining a comprehensive un-
derstanding of how the Ysa T3SS mechanistically inÔ¨Çu-
ences pathogenesis will depend on efforts to distinguish
the functions of the effectors it delivers.

In this regard, eight additional translocated effectors have
been identiÔ¨Åed (YspA, YspE, YspF, YspI, YspK, YspL,
YspM, and YspP) (Table 1). YspA was recognized from
analysis of genes within the Ysa-PI [27]. Recently, a
comprehensive proteomics approach deÔ¨Åned the complex-
ity of the Ysa T3SS secretome [33]. This effort conÔ¨Årmed
YspA as an effector and additionally identiÔ¨Åed YspE, YspF,
YspI, YspK, YspL, and YspP. Each of these effectors was
shown to be necessary for full virulence of Y. enterocolitica
Biovar 1B in the mouse gastroenteritis competitive index
assay [33]. Finally, YspM was identiÔ¨Åed later as an
effector produced by a subset of Biovar 1B strains. When
including YopE, YopN, and YopJ/P, the Ysa T3SS appears
to deliver a collection of ten, and potentially eleven,
effectors depending upon the strain examined.

It is striking that the genes encoding the effectors deliv-
ered by the Ysa T3SS are dispersed throughout the
genome [33] (Figure 2). One ysp is located within the
Ysa-PI, three are located on plasmid pYV, but the seven
remaining map to sites dispersed throughout the chromo-
some. The lack of ysp gene co-localization inspires the

idea that the evolution of Y. enterocolitica Biovar 1B
involved numerous genetic lateral transfer events. The
dispersed gene distribution combined with the complex-
ity of the Ysps suggests that Y. enterocolitica Biovar 1B has
experienced strong selective pressure to maintain the Ysa
T3SS. This may reÔ¨Çect how this group of Yersina has
adapted to survive differently in the gastrointestinal
environment and may help to explain the severity of
human infections they cause.

targets of the effector proteins delivered by the Ysa

T3SS are largely open for investigation (Table 1, and
Figure 1). Several of the Ysps contain regions or domains
that can be predicted to have particular functions. YspK
serine/threonine kinase activity and YspP tyrosine phos-
phatase activity were demonstrated using in vitro-based
biochemical assays [33]. Furthermore, YspK shares 91%
identity with OspG, an effector produced by Shigella
Ô¨Çexneri [34]. OspG can bind ubiquitinylated E2 con-
jugating enzymes, including UbcH5b that is responsible
for targeting the degradation of many important signaling
factors such as phospho-IkBa by the proteasome [34].
By interfering with phospho-IkBa degradation, its com-
plex with NF-kB is maintained, which suppresses acti-
vation of this proinÔ¨Çammatory pathway. Using yeast two-
hybrid analysis, YspK has also been shown to interact with
E2 proteins (Matsumoto and Young, unpublished data).
This result suggests that YspK and OspG have similar
functions in targeting cellular components to limit the
innate immune response (Figure 1). YspM is predicted to
be a GDSL lipase and when expressed in Saccharomyces
cerevisiae it prevents cell growth. It is tantalizing to con-
sider that the predicted lipase activity may be targeting an
essential cellular component but this remains to be
demonstrated [35]. Other Ysps with interesting domains
predicted by computational analysis include YspE with an
ADP-ribosyltransferase motif (Matsumoto and Young,
unpublished results).
In other pathogenic bacteria
ADP-ribosyltransferases are among the most potent viru-
lence factors, marking YspE as a high priority for explora-
tion of its cellular target [36]. Likewise, a calcium-binding
motif predicted for YspI is a unique characteristic of an
effector. This may indicate YspI belongs to a new class of
virulence factors affecting cellular activities through a
novel mechanism triggered by calcium sensing. Clearly
these are speculative predictions, but they are presented
to highlight the potential within the study of the Ysp
effector proteins to reveal new facets of host‚Äìpathogen
interactions.

New Yersinia effectors yet to be discovered
Genomic sequencing of numerous strains of Y. pestis and
Y. pseudotuberculosis have revealed a locus with the poten-
tial to encode a T3SS that is different than either the Ysc
or Ysa T3SSs [37,38]. This system resembles the Ssa
T3SS of Salmonella enterica [39]. It has also been reported
that this locus is present in some Y. enterocolitica serotype
O:3 strains [40]. To date, no clear link between this T3SS
and virulence has been established. On another front, one
controversial study has suggested the insecticidal toxin-
like proteins (IT-like proteins) of Y. pestis and Y. pseudo-
tuberculosis may form a new group of effectors [41]. This
assertion was based on the observation that in vitro
ectopic expression of
these IT-like proteins led to
secretion, and in one case even translocation into insect
and mammalian cells, by the Ysc T3SS. The idea that the
Ysc T3S is the native secretion pathway for the insecti-
cidal toxin has recently been challenged, but it remains a

formal possibility that they are exported by the chromo-
somal-encoded Ssa-like T3SS [42].

Do Yersinia translocate effectors by other
mechanisms?
Direct translocation of effectors into host cells by Gram-
negative bacteria can additionally involve T4SSs and
T6SSs. Recent genomic analysis has suggested the pre-
sence of several potential T6SSs encoded by loci dis-
persed among Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis genomes
[43,44]. Some of
these gene-clusters could encode
proteins homologous to the Hcp- and VgrG-families of
secreted proteins and effectors. It has also been reported
that some Y. pseudotuberculosis strains carry a plasmid
potentially encoding a T4SS [45]. there appears to be
abundant opportunity for new effectors to be discovered.

Conclusions
The Yop effectors are nearly identical between Y. pestis,
Y. pseudotuberculosis, and Y. enterocolitica. The study of
pathogenic Yersinia presents an opportunity to examine
how these effectors are utilized by pathogenic species
causing different types of infections. The discovery of the
Ysa T3SS of Y. enterocolitica Biovar 1B expands on this
theme of comparative pathology by further revealing that
some effectors, like YopE and YopJ/P, can contribute to
disease when delivered through other pathways, such as
the Ysa T3SS. However, the new twists on effector
biology will come from further pursuing the functions
of newly discovered effectors such as the Ysps. With the
recognition of possible translocated effectors by T6SSs,
there appears to be abundant opportunity for new effec-
tors to be discovered.

The complete genome sequence and comparative genome
analysis of the high pathogenicity Yersinia enterocolitica
strain 8081. PLoS Genet 2006, 2:e206.

The complete genome analysis of Y. enterocolitica revealed numerous
insights on the evolution of this genus. Among the new insights was the
plasticity zone, a genomic region containing numerous virulence factors
such as the Ysa T3SS, YAPI pilus and Yst-1 T2SS system.

the suite of Ysp proteins exported by the Ysa type III secretion

2006, 59:689-706.

The study revealed a completely new set of Yersinia effectors that affect
the outcome of a gastrointestinal infection. This information helped to
clarify that the Ysa T3S system was needed for the infection of a
mammalian host.

This study has important implications on understanding the function of
YspK, which is 91% identical to OspG. A series of elegant biochemical
approaches and the use of a mouse model of infection revealed that
OspG interacts with ubiquitin-cojugating enzymes to direct suppression
of the proinÔ¨Çammatory pathways and affect disease pathology.

This work described the identiÔ¨Åcation of Ysa T3SS effector YspM pro-
duced by a subset of Y. enterocolitica strains. YspM is homologous to
proteins classiÔ¨Åed as GDSL bacterial
lipases and resulted in growth
inhibition when expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

In this study, the authors demonstrated that insecticidal toxins are extra-
cellularly secreted. Thus, it was proposed that these proteins are not likely
to be translocated effectors as originally hypothesized by others.
