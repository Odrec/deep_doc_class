An Agonistic Approach to the Future of Europe 

Chantal Mouffe

Today the european project is at a crossroads and unfortunately 

its survival cannot be taken for granted. Important decisions need 
to be made to secure the future of the European Union. It is too 
early to know which direction the EU will follow, but the consequences 
of those decisions will be far reaching. There is a general agreement 
among the advocates of the EU that more integration is necessary, but 
there  are  wide  disagreements  about  how  to  visualize  such  a  process. 
The  grounds  of  those  disagreements  are  multiple:  besides  being  the 
expression of political differences, they also entail philosophical diver-
gences that need to be brought to the fore to grasp what is at stake in 
the current debate.

An important divergence concerns the place that national identities 
should play in the future of the EU and in its modes of integration. In 
order to address this issue, it is necessary to have a proper understanding 
of the nature of collective identities and their resilience. Indeed, contrary 
to all those who expected the generalization of postconventional and 
postnational forms of identity, what we are today witnessing is a rein-
forcement of national identities. And when this is not the case, it is not 
the supranational level that is becoming more important, but rather the 
increasing role played by regional forms of identification. This indicates 
that, while the nation-states might be losing some of their power and 
prerogatives—and it must be said that even with respect to the extent of 
this loss there are very serious disagreements among theorists—this is not 
accompanied by a disappearance of national forms of identification. In 
fact, one could even argue that the opposite is happening: witness, for 
example, the increasing role they play in sport competitions. Hence the 
need to acknowledge that, at least for the foreseeable future, national 
forms of allegiance are unlikely to disappear, and it is futile to expect 
people to relinquish their national identity in favor of a postnational 
European  one.  To  try  to  impose  a  form  of  European  integration  in 
denial of this fact would be a very dangerous strategy that could only 
lead to negative reactions against the European project. 

My  concern,  as  a  political  theorist,  is  that  many  conceptions  of  a 
postnational Europe are informed by an individualistic and rationalistic
