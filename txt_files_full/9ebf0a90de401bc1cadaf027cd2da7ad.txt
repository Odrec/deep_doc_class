Abstract

With  point   of   departure   in   the   understanding   of   place   as   relational   and   of
gentrification as an inherently political process, this  thesis  adopts  ethnographic
methods to investigate the gentrification of the favela of Vidigal, Rio de Janeiro. The
phenomenon is approached at two different but interrelated levels of analysis. The
first level investigates the ways in which newcomers construct the favela as place.
The favela emerges as 'authentic', constructed in opposition to the homogeneity that
is perceived to  dominate Rio's  richer  neighbourhoods and  the Western capitals
many newcomers come from. Two main representations come forth: the favela as a
site of struggle and the favela as creative hub.  The gentrification of the favela,
particularly when at the hands of young, creative foreigners, assumes a colonial
aura,  as  Vidigal  emerges  as a  background  scenery  for  the   reproduction of  the
newcomers' middle-class lives, more than as a place of genuine interaction.  This
aspect outlines also the peculiarity of the global flow of gentrifers that characterises
favela   gentrification.  The   second   level   of   analysis   investigates  how   these
representations   and   the   newcomers'  practices   affect   social   relations   within  the
favela,   with   particular   focus   on   housing,   the   party   scene   and   everyday   life
interaction. Primarily based on interviews with both newcomers and old-timers, this
thesis shows how gentrification has a multi-fold impact on the social relations in the
favela. In particular, gentrification forces new power relations into Vidigal, taking
with it conflicts previously unknown inside the favela and causing both physical and
social displacement. As a result of the new power dynamics, the numeric majority of
Vidigal  becomes  a minority  in regard to its power to define the place favela.  The
future of the favela and of its inhabitants appears to be at risk, as gentrification is
fostered by public and private investments in view of the mega-events Rio is to host
in the coming years, and by the process of pacification.

0 - Prologue

… Three… two… one… The crowd jubilates, thousands of corks fly high in the air to fall
back down on the sand a few seconds after. I hug the people around me. Smiles and
kisses and sips of warm sparkling wine blend together in this hot summer night. The
most impressive firework show I have witnessed in my life begins. It's midnight. It's
January 1st, 2011. It's Copacabana beach, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Rogerio, my host, leads
me and the ten people that are with us from one street party to the other. At Ipanema
beach I meet April, someone's friend's friend, an American girl on holiday in Rio for a
few days. When small-talk leaves space to an embarrassed silence, I notice she is staring
behind my shoulder. “That's just so amazing”, she mutters. I turn my head to see what
has gotten her attention. She is looking beyond Ipanema and the dancing crowds, bey-
ond Leblon. Despite the distance, I recognise the red letters spelling Sheraton. But it is
what is behind the Sheraton hotel, April is staring at. It is perched on the mountain like
ivy on a tree, its myriad of lights playing tricks with the distance and moving like
candles. It's Vidigal. It's a favela1. A slum. From here, it looks incredible. April tells me
she is staying at the Sheraton with her friend, a holiday they have paid with frequent
flyer's miles accumulated through their corporate jobs in the US. “We see the favela
every day from our window, but I had never seen it at night and from the distance”, she
says. She tells me she has heard about favela parties, where you are taken on a bus to a
party on the top of a favela. It costs a bit, but she has read online that the experience is
unforgettable. She might check one out. “Weird”, I think. “Why would you want to go
partying in a slum?”. I leave Rio, heading north, two days later.
1 The term 'favela' can be considered as the Brazilian equivalent to the English term 'slum'.
These settlements, often on squatted land, are home to low income residents, and often lack
the most basic infrastructure. I provide a more in-depth explanation about favelas in section
3.2.

1 -  Introduction

It is December 30th, 2012. It is summer and the temperature lives up to expectation. I
have just landed in Rio, and I am heading towards Vidigal, where I will live for the next
seven weeks, doing field-work for my thesis. The favela is changing. It's gentrifying2,
they say. We will see what I find out. I get off the mini-bus in front of a small, half-moon
shaped square. It's the entrance of Vidigal, along the coast road. I also see a line of
people standing where the road begins going up the mountain: it must be the stop I had
been told to look for. I fish out of my pocket a small piece of paper where I have written
the directions that Oscar, who will rent me a room for the first week, sent me by e-mail. I
wait twenty minutes in the sun before my turn comes. A young guy with a black motor-
bike hands me a worn-down helmet and picks me up, my backpack sticking out behind
the motorbike's back-wheel. I tell the driver to drop me off at the Campista, as Oscar in-
structed me to do. He accelerates and we begin driving up. The road is very steep: the
heavy backpack and my driver's speed make me fear we will tip backwards as soon as
his front wheel hits a small pebble. After the first two turns the road goes up straight,
and I can see Vidigal climbing all the way to the top of the mountain in front of me. I see
houses all over its surface. To the left they are small and densely built, while further up I
can see trees among them, it looks less dense. My driver slows down. Two cars, one go-
ing up and one down, are trying to pass each other in the narrow road we are driving on.
There is a blue supermarket on the right, and smaller shops on the left. People are cross-
ing the road and walking up and down all over. In the background I hear funk, Rio's
favelas' typical music. Someone played it for me last time I was here. The cars are
through, and we continue on the way up. My backpack feels heavier and heavier. I see
2 The term 'gentrification' describes a process of neighbourhood change, triggered by the ar-
rival of wealthier residents or by new investment, and the consequences that these changes
entail on the geography of the neighbourhood. I present the concept more in depth in section
3.5.

kids playing with kites from a stair that crawls up on the side of the road. Some men
hang out in front of a bar, while others carry bags of cement up the road. There is a
U-turn where my muscles can relax for a couple of seconds, before the driver accelerates
again and I have to hold to the motorbike to avoid falling backwards. The road changes
from asphalt to porphyry stone. I am nervous. I am going up, and I have no idea what to
expect when I will get there. Maybe it was all a bad idea? I have the time to wonder if
field-work was a poor choice, before the driver breaks and turns to avoid a dog that has
thrown itself on the road from nowhere. I focus on the road again. It's as steep as it was
at the bottom. Or maybe steeper? Finally the motorbike slows down, the road is flat for a
short stretch, before the driver stops and tells me the bar do Campista is the little one on
the left. It is quiet up here. There is a small square with trees and three cement tables,
red plastic chairs around them. There are two men playing checkers, while kids play in
the shade. I pay for the ride and get into the bar. I ask for Oscar, a Frenchman living
nearby. When the old man in the bar speaks I cannot understand a word of what he is
saying. Luckily he uses his hands, and I follow his directions up the long and narrow
stair between two houses. I turn right almost at the end of the stair and I see a wooden
door with a doorbell. I ring and a young girl comes to open. She speaks Spanish to me,
and in Spanish I ask if Oscar is home. She takes me into the living room and up a narrow
stair, then out onto a wooden landing, where she points at a thin man drinking juice in
the sun on a little terrace. I approach him to say hi and I look to the right: wow, the view

1.1 -  This Thesis

When I first came across upon an online article about gentrification in Rio de Janeiro's
favelas, I found the issue to be too interesting to be dismissed without further reading.
The articles available online, some in English and some in Portuguese, were all very re-
cent and had been featured in online newspapers, blogs and community organisations'
websites (see Rio Real, 2010 & 2012; News Gallery, 2011 and Rio on Watch, 2012a-b, O
Globo, 2102b). What I could evince was that a new type of resident, and amongst them
some foreigners, had begun to move into some of Rio's favelas. However, it seemed that
the field was too new to have awoken academic attention, and scholarly articles on
favelas would invariably address other issues than gentrification4. The social and human
4 The academic interest on the issue seems to be on the rise. During the final weeks of this re-
search I have encountered another master thesis, that has been written almost simultan-
eously to mine, by a Harvard University student named Jake Cummings (2013). Cummings

consequences of this process had already guided one of my previous university projects,
in that case focusing on Copenhagen. But the presence of such a process in a slum soun-
ded like a new, interesting and very serious phenomenon, that could affect the lives of
many people already living in conditions of extreme poverty. Several questions arose
from the few online sources and no answers were given. How does gentrification hap-
pen in a slum? Would it be the same as in Lower Manhattan or East Berlin? Who are the
gentrifiers and what brings them to a favela? And what happens to the old-time resid-
ents5? Does the phenomenon enhance existing inequalities? The desire to find an an-
swer to these and many more questions, as well as the possibility of contributing to the
scientific understanding of a new, unstudied phenomenon, brought me to choose this
topic for my master thesis.
Also due to my previous research on the issue, I understand gentrification as an inher-
ently political process, in which power relations are constantly at play for the definition
of the gentrifying neighbourhood. The arrival of a new type of resident tends to bring
about new power struggles for the (re)definition of the neighbourhood. Whether
through displacement or through a new set of norms, gentrification changes the gentri-
fied neighbourhood and affects its inhabitants' social relations with it.
Indeed, this thesis aims at understanding the phenomenon of favela gentrification, in-
vestigating both the arrival of newcomers and how social relations in favela are affected
by the arrival of this new type of resident. As it is explained more in depth in the follow-
ing pages, I have narrowed down my study to one favela in the Zona Sul [South Zone] of
Rio de Janeiro, the favela of Vidigal. Empirical materials have been collected during a
writes about gentrification in Rio's favelas, and compares the process in two favelas, Rocinha
and Vidigal.
5 Throughout the entire thesis I refer to 'newcomers' and 'old-timers' (or 'old-time residents').
I call 'newcomers' those residents that have recently moved to the favela, for the vast major-
ity highly educated, young and dynamic foreigners and Brazilians. The 'old-timers' have to be
understood as those residents that lived in the favela before it began attracting its new resid-
ents. The complex construction of old-timer has also been discussed by Brown-Saracino
(2004:141ff & 2009:145ff).

seven weeks-long field-work from the end of December, 2012 to mid-February, 2013. In
this period I have lived in Vidigal, which gave me the possibility to undertake twenty-
four interviews, participant observations and in general to interact with new and old-
time residents, as well as to gather original records about the favela that would have
otherwise been unavailable to study (see app. E). In the spring and early summer of
2013 I have analysed the collected materials, with the aim of analysing what brings new-
comers to Vidigal, how their arrival is perceived by old-timers and how their presence is
affecting the social relations within the favela.

2 -  Problem Field

Rio de Janeiro's favelas have been at the centre of much national and international at-
tention in the last decades. The international success of the film City of God (2002)6 and
the rapid rise of favela tourism have had an important role in altering the representation
of the favela at a global level (Freire-Medeiros, 2011:23). In
a recent article about the favela as a tourist attraction pub-
lished on the journal Tourism   Geographies, Austrian re-
searcher Thomas Frisch (2012) identifies two different rep-
resentations of the favela in public discourse. The first one,
the “problem-centred” one, is presented as “dominant”, and
builds on the image of the favela as a place of violence and
poverty that has often been portrayed in the media. The
second one, the “idealized” version, is identified as a reac-
tion to the first one, and focuses on the cultural capital of
the favela (Frisch, 2012:327). Brazilian sociologist Bianca
Freire-Medeiros argues that this second representation has been capable of re-branding
favelas as “alternative” and “hip” (Freire-Medeiros, 2009a:583), promoting the creation
and global circulation of a “trademark” favela (ibid.:582). 
The favela is identified as a place rich in cultural potential, where neighbours take an
interest in each other lives, so that “affective neighbourhoods relationships” still charac-
terize the everyday life. An everyday life which is in contrasted with the rest of society,
where such relationships are perceived to have disappeared (Frisch, 2012:328). For
many it is the place where the 'authentic' Brazil is to be found, as it is here that the pre-
conceived images of 'real' Brazilian life are to be found and confirmed (Freire-Medeiros,
6 The film City of God, directed by Brazilian Fernando Meirelles, crudely portraits life in Rio's
favela Cidade de Deus [City of God], whose population is kept hostage by rivalling drug fac-
tions and corrupted policemen.

 2011:27).
Adding to the changes in the representation of the favela, global mega-events have
also had an impact on the favelas both physically and on the ways in which they are per-
ceived. As Rio is host of the final of the football World Cup in 2014 and of the Olympic
games in 2016, it is no surprise that the national and local administration have a strong
interest in relocating, pacifying or upgrading the city's most central and most violent
favelas. Also within this frame, a wide array of social projects and initiatives have ad-
dressed security, housing and health problems, with the creation, for instance, of the
contested Police Pacification Unit (UPP). This police unit, instituted in 2008, has been
the key element in the much debated Rio State pacification project, whose goal is to re-
gain control of the favelas from the ruling drug lords before the upcoming global events.
UPP police, trained both with traditional police methods and as social workers, are ex-
pected not only to control the territory, but also to aid the social development of the
favela (see UPP social, 2013a). Police presence in the favelas has contributed to inject an
increasing feeling of safety around these areas, and thus contrasting the representation
of the favela that Frisch defined as “dominant”.
The increased sense of safety and the improvements in infrastructure that these new
social projects have brought (or promised to bring), together with the attractiveness
favelas wield due to the circulation of the global trademark favela, have triggered a pro-
cess previously unseen in this context: gentrification. A new young, dynamic and creat-
ive type of resident has made its appearance in some of Rio's central favelas, such as Vi-
digal, Santa Marta and Rocinha. Favelas are no longer only the slums of the poor or
tourist destinations, but have become home for a new type of resident (O Globo, 2012b).

2.1 -  Research question

A new factor in the dynamics of the favela, the arrival of newcomers is likely to have
an impact on the receiving community. The outcome of this process can vary, and can

Problem Field

come to benefit or disadvantage favela residents in differing ways. Initial reports of
favela gentrification indicate a risk of displacement of old-time residents due to rising
housing prices (Rio On Watch, 2012a). As this process continues, it is possible that some
of the lifestyles and the social relations that had attracted the newcomers to begin with
– because they had been identified as the 'authentic' Brazil – could also be affected.
Favela gentrification appears as a new phenomenon. This thesis aims at being a mod-
est contribution in this new, exciting field of study.
For these reasons, the research question that guides this research is:

Which constructions  of place emerge with  the arrival of a  new  type of
resident  to  Rio's  favela  Vidigal,  and how do these constructions and the
newcomers'  practices  affect the  social  relations of  the  residents of  the
favela?

2.1.1 -  Thesis Structure

This thesis is divided into three parts. Apart from introduction and problem formula-
tion, Part I consists of theory and methodology. In chapter 3 I present the theoretical
concepts that form my background knowledge and that guide this entire research. I be-
gin by introducing my social constructionist approach to this research. I then proceed
with a presentation of slums in general and of favelas more in the specific, focusing on
the way in which representations of the favela have changed in the recent years. There-
after I present the concepts of place and of gentrification, referring to the respective aca-
demic debates and to the ways in which they can be useful for this research. I conclude
the section on gentrification with a brief presentation of the theme of authenticity, fo-
cusing on the role authenticity has in gentrification processes and in place-making. The
questions that form the backbone of the chapter refer in fact to the ways in which we
can understand and research place-making, particularly in a global context, and the
workings of gentrification. The answers to these questions guide the entire research. In

15

Part I – The Frame

chapter 4 I present my methodological approach. I introduce the methods used in this
research and relate them to my theoretical approach. In the second part of this chapter I
focus on how to operationalise these methods.
Part II consists of the analysis, and it is divided into three chapters. In chapter 5, I
briefly present the favela of Vidigal, my case-study, to the reader. I provide here a de-
scription of the favela and of its social composition. Thereafter, I analyse my empirical
material in chapters 6 and 7. In chapter 6 I focus on the first part of the research ques-
tion, presenting the different representations of the favela that emerge from Vidigal's
newcomers. In this part I focus on how meaning is constructed, which constructions are
dominant among newcomers and how these constructions mutually interact with the
newcomers' perception of 'what is authentic'. By highlighting how newcomers ascribe
meaning to Vidigal I also identify which positions these representations make available
to both newcomers and old-timers. In chapter 7 I focus on the second part of the re-
search question. The purpose of the chapter is that of investigating to what extent the
arrival of newcomers has altered the social relations in Vidigal. I do so by identifying
three spheres of the favela's everyday life that have been affected by the arrival of new-
comers and by gentrification. These spheres, that I called 'housing', 'parties' and 'every-
day interaction', have emerged from my empirical material as the most affected by the
ongoing changes in the favela. Finally, in Part III I sum up my conclusions and put this
research in perspective: what does this thesis contribute with? Which new questions
have emerged from this research?

16

3 -  Theory

The chapter takes point of departure in my approach to this research. In this section I
briefly present my position as a researcher, and my relation to the analytical object. This
is followed by an overview of the current research about representation of the favela.
After placing favelas in a historical perspective, I focus on the recent shift from the favela
as 'a problem' to the favela as an 'emerging global trademark', a shift that has driven a
change in the mode of consumption (and production) of the favela. Thereafter, I discuss
the concept of place and present which of its connotations are useful in my research. I
then introduce the concept of gentrification, presenting the different theories that aim
at explaining why gentrification occurs. Finally, I outline the concept of authenticity as it
is presented in theory on gentrification, as this is a relevant concept in my analysis.

3.1 -  My Approach

The theoretical approach that I adopt in this thesis is social constructionist with an
interactionist perspective, as defined by Finnish sociologist Margaretha Jaärvinen and
Danish sociologist Nanna Mik-Meyer in the anthology Kvalitative Metoder i et Interak-
tionistisk Perspektiv (2005) [Qualitative methods in an interactionist perspective].
Jaärvinen and Mik-Meyer (2005a:7) desire to bring attention to the methodological
consequences of a social constructionist approach. The two sociologists argue that from
a methodological perspective it is not possible to clearly distinguish constructionism
from phenomenology and hermeneutic, but that the division must be found in the per-
ception of the analytical object. A constructionist approach regards the analytical object
as a “fluid, unstable and ambiguous phenomenon, which is shaped in the meeting with

17

Part I – The Frame

the researcher” (Mik-Meyer and Jaärvinen, 2005:9, my translation7). A phenomenological
approach regards, on the other hand, the analytical object as a “more or less stable en-
tity”, and assumes the possibility to uncover a form of truth inherent in the actors stud-
ied (ibid.). I approach the analytical object as the constructionist tradition does, and I
position myself methodologically as an interactionist. Both in regard to the choice of
sources (a combination of interviews, participant observations and document analysis)
and to the way the research strategy is designed, the interactionist perspective moves its
focus away from the individual actor, to concentrate on how meaning is produced
through concrete social interaction (ibid.:11). Mik-Meyer and Jaärvinen argue that “the
meaning of an act or of a phenomenon is created in interaction between people or
between people and objects. […] Meaning is therefore a relational phenomenon, which
can only be determined situationally and by involving the surrounding context”
(ibid.:10). 
In this thesis I analyse how social activities produce patterns in people's lives, rather
than focus on individual phenomena per se. Likewise, the analysis focuses on my inform-
ants' interaction with the world around them, as well as the interaction between their
world-views and their practices. I aim to unravel both their relation with other favela
residents and with the social context their actions are inscribed within. Furthermore, in
accordance to this theoretical tradition, I see my material as shaped by my informants in
interaction with the researcher, myself. In an interactionist view, different social identit-
ies are constantly negotiated between the informant and the researcher, and the empir-
ical material is a result of the different positionings the two assume during the exchange
(Jaärvinen, 2005:29-30).
In chapter 4 I present my methodological choices, and I relate them to the social con-
structionist approach in an interactionist perspective.
7 Throughout the entire thesis, translations from both Danish and Portuguese are my transla-
tions, except for the interviews supported by the help of a translator. This is explained more
in depth in section 4.3.

Theory

3.2 -  Origin of a Favela

The origin of the favela8 can be traced back to a combination of “mythological” and
“realistic” elements (Frisch, 2012:324). During the 1897 war against a rebel uprising in
Canudos, in north-eastern Brazil, soldiers camped in an area covered by vegetation re-
ferred to as 'favela'. At their return to Rio de Janeiro, when they did not receive the hous-
ing that the government had promised them, they camped on Morro da Provideência, a
hill close to the city, in a settlement that was then named favela as a clear reference to
Canudos (Jaguaribe, 2004:339 “Note 1”). In the following years, the eviction of tradition-
al forms of housing for the poor from the city centre (the cortiços) forced their previous
inhabitants to look for shelter on the hills around the city, building shacks and consolid-
ating a form of housing that is now widespread in the whole of Brazil – namely the
favela9 (Frisch, 2012:324 and Freire-Medeiros, 2009a:581). Described by Jaguaribe
(2004:339 “Note 1”) as “a slum area without basic sanitation and infrastructure”, more
than 26 favelas were identified in Rio de Janeiro already in 1920 (Abreu, 1987 in Freire-
Medeiros, 2009a:581). Social programs targeted favelas already since 1902, and it is
possible to trace a link between these policies and Brazil's political history. While au-
thoritarian regimes attempted to eliminate these areas, the focus during democratic
periods has been on improving the basic living conditions for their inhabitants (Frisch,
2012:324-325). During the 1940s the government created the parques proletários, hous-
ing complexes where favela dwellers were relocated and in which the inhabitants should
have been disciplined and “transformed into decent workers” (ibid.:325).
With Brazil moving towards democracy in the late 1970s, favela inhabitants began to
be seen as entitled to rights, and the removal plans gave way to new urbanization
strategies aiming at incorporating favelas into the urban texture. An example of these
new strategies is the 'Favela-Bairro' program, that provides investment in basic services
and with the aim of integrating the favela with the bordering neighbourhoods (ibid.).
Nonetheless, Freire-Medeiros (2009a:581) points out how “by the turn of the millenni-

um […] [favelas'] populations still suffer from a heavy social stigma and from police bru-
tality ”. This is confirmed by various accounts from my old-time informants. Among
them, Danilo10 (app. C.3) recalls: “I have been humiliated by the police. In the afternoon,
at 3 pm, I was coming up from school and the cops ordered to take my clothes off in the
middle of the streets. I was naked in the middle of the street. With my school clothes and
materials with me”.

3.3 -  The Favela as a “Global Trademark”

Frisch (2012:327ff.) identifies two “main discourses” that are recurring in the con-
temporary understanding and articulation of the favela: what he calls the “problem
centred and the idealized discourse”. The problem centred discourse focuses on the
problematic issues pertaining the favela: in particular crime, violence and drug traffick-
ing. According to this view, the favela is identified as a problem, both socially, culturally
and security-wise. On the other hand, the idealized discourse focuses on the cultural pe-
culiarity of the favela and on its sense of community, in what Frisch defines a relativisa-
tion of the problems (ibid.:328). A good example of the problem centred discourse
emerges from my informant Reneé11 (app. C.14). The French newcomer recalls how,
heading towards the favela of Vidigal for the first time, he asked the woman selling tick-
ets if that was the right bus to go to Vidigal. When he said his destination, the woman,
probably thinking about the recent drug wars in the favela, looked at him, and said “Oh

my God” while making the sign of the cross.
Freire-Medeiros points out how, in the most recent years, the idealized version has
led to what she defines the “global circulation of the favela as a trademark” (2009a:581,
emphasis in the original). Since the international deébut of the film City of God in 2002,
the favela has made a new appearance in the global imaginary, and has “acquired cult
status” in several Western countries (Leu, 2004 in Freire-Medeiros, 2009a:583). Favela-
themed restaurants and clubs have emerged from London to Paris and Sydney, drawing
on the favela imaginary as it has been projected at a global level (Freire-Medeiros,
2009a:583).
This celebration of favela life both draws upon and contributes to another recent phe-
nomenon, that has turned the central favelas in the city of Rio de Janeiro into tourist at-
tractions. Inscribed in the scholarly field of slum tourism, favela tourism has seen a rap-
id increase in the last decade, drawing the attention of several scholars.12 Slum tourism
can be considered as an important confirmation of the shift between the two represent-
ations of the favela that I have here presented.
Brazilian sociologist Licia Valladares identifies three “dogmas” that emerge from aca-
demic research on the favela. They are: “(a) [the favela's] particularity – i.e. the emphas-
is of difference to other city areas, (b) its unity – i.e. the treatment as a homogeneous
phenomenon by using 'favela' in the singular; and (c) the characterization as the urban
space of poverty per se” (2005 in Frisch, 2012:326, emphasis in the original). In these
“dogmas” the place favela appears as defined from the outside, and as something specif-
ic but different from the rest of Rio. In the following section I introduce how I conceptu-
alise place, a concept that is central throughout the entire thesis.

12 The general purpose of this section is that of supplying the reader with a background know-
ledge on favelas and on the ways they have been perceived or represented through the years.
It is not my intention to investigate the field of slum tourism. For a more detailed discussion
on slum tourism and favelas, see, among others, Freire-Medeiros, 2009b-c.

3.4 -  Place

3.4.1 -  Place as a social construction

In this section I introduce the concept of place. I begin by presenting place as a social
construction. This conceptualisation is one of the milestones of this entire research. I
later introduce the importance of practice in place-making, an understanding that is of
great importance not only theoretically, but also methodologically. To conclude this sec-
tion I briefly present the important academic discussion about place and place-making
in a globalised world.
British geographer Tim Cresswell provides us an overview over the scholarly debate
on place. In his book Place: a short introduction (2004), Cresswell begins by defining the
'sense of place'. This is presented as “the subjective and emotional attachment people
have to place” (2004:3). Cresswell points out how “the most straightforward and com-
mon definition of place [is that of] a meaningful location” (ibid.:7; my emphasis).
Cresswell continues by presenting different theoretical positions on the concept of
place, and explains how these concepts have built upon, or criticized, one another
(ibid.:15-51). He concludes his “Genealogy of Place” by presenting three main traditions
in approaching place: the “descriptive approach”, the “social constructionist” and the
“phenomenological” (ibid.:51).
For the purposes of this thesis, and in line with my theoretical choices, my conceptu-
alisation of place takes its starting point in the social constructionist approach. Cress-
well cites, among others, geographer David Harvey as a representative of the social con-
structionist view on place: “[p]lace, in whatever guise, is like space and time, a social
construct. This is the baseline proposition from which I start. The only interesting ques-
tion that can then be asked is: by what social process(es) is place constructed?” (Harvey,
1996:261 in Cresswell, 2004:29). Cresswell shares this approach, as he highlights how
“place does not have meanings that are natural and obvious but ones that are created by
some people with more power than others to define what is and is not appropriate”

22

(Cresswell, 2004:27). This understanding of place as socially constructed is also shared
by anthropologist Margaret Rodman, who highlights how “[p]laces are not inert contain-
ers. They are politicized, culturally relative, historically specific, local and multiple con-
structions” (Rodman, 1992:641). Rodman calls for the need to recognise that construc-
tions about place are different for different inhabitants of the same place, and that each
of these constructions is unique (ibid.:643). Rodman invites the reader to 'empower
place' and to understand the socially contested constructions of place as a grounding for
ideas and competing narratives (ibid.:652). In this thesis I 'empower' place by under-
standing it as relational and as defined by constant power struggles between the actors
that inhabit it. The favela emerges therefore as a contested place: a location “where
there is a conflict related to control of resources or access to power” (Low and
Lawrence-Zunñiga, 2003:18). The conflict in the favela, as I present in chapter 6, regards
primarily who has the right to define what kind of place the favela is and what practices
are perceived as good or bad.
In this thesis I highlight the different ways in which informants construct place, and
what this might tell us about the social relations in the favela. As it is presented in
chapter 4, the main part of the empirical material for this thesis is collected in the field
through interviews and observations. For this reason, it is important to include in our
conceptualisation of place another aspect.
In his chapter concerning the “Genealogy of Place”, Cresswell (2004:15-51) presents
Allan Pred's understanding of place as “never 'finished' but always 'becoming'” (Pred,
1984:279 in Cresswell, 2004:35). A landscape is physically constructed without our in-
fluence, but as we inhabit it, we can act (and interact with it) in unpredictable ways. Ob-
jects can be moved around in a room, short cuts taken in a park, public squares used for
activities that were not in the architect's or city planner's original intention. These un-
predictable actions can influence the place they are performed in, leading to changes in
its original characteristics (Cresswell, 2004:35-37). This is, in fact, what Pred points out:

3.4.2 -  Place as practice

Theory

23

Part I – The Frame

“[p]laces are never finished but always the result of processes and practices” (Pred,
1984 in Cresswell, 2004:37). Place emerges as a result of social relations, that both
through language and practices constantly negotiate what meaning is ascribed to space.
The focus shifts onto the everyday life. Rodman represents a similar vision, as she points
out how “places come into being through praxis, not just through narratives” (Rodman,
1992:642). The same focus on praxis can be found in Michel de Certeau's work The
Practice   of   Everyday   Life  (1984). In the chapter “Walking in the City”, de Certeau
(1984:91-110) presents the ability of everyday practices of re-constructing places in
ways that were not previously determined. De Certeau inscribes his theory within the
frame of a power struggle between strategies and tactics. Strategies are manipulations
by “subject[s] with will and power (a business, an army […])” (de Certeau, 1984:35-36),
that can delimit space, while tactics are “an art of the weak”, which have to operate in
the framework that has been set by strategies, making use of opportunities and open-
ings that emerge “in the surveillance of proprietary powers” (ibid.:37). Referring to Fou-
cault and his theories on power, governmentality and surveillance (ibid.:96), de Certeau
outlines the possibilities that urban life offers to evade from what he calls the “urbanist-
ic project”, which consists in a normalisation and normatisation of the individual, which
is made into an anonymous user of the city space (ibid.:95). De Certeau's goal is to “loc-
ate the practices that are foreign to the “geometrical” or “geographical” space of visual,
panoptic, or theoretical constructions” (ibid.:93). A panoptic view of the city from above,
in which streets can be seen in their entirety and mapped, is contrasted with the every-
day practice of walking the streets (ibid.:92-93). Walkers bind the city together through
footsteps, and their movements create “real systems whose existence in fact makes up
the city” (Alexander, 1967 in de Certeau, 1984:97). De Certeau, through a comparison
with linguistics, argues that the cold and faceless “urbanistic project” is contrasted by
the everyday practice of walking, which, creating trajectories that are unexpected and
unmappable, adds meaning to the city's empty space (de Certeau, 1984:97-102). De Cer-
teau invites us to understand place as socially constructed not only through language,
but also through the practices that men and women undertake in space, and that fill it
with meaning.

24

Theory

Thinking of place as performed and practiced can help us think of place in radically open and
non-essentialized ways, where place is constantly struggled over and reimagined in practical ways.

Names, legends and memories also contribute to fill space with meaning. Names giv-
en to place serve according to de Certeau “as imaginary meeting-points”, which “carve
out pockets of hidden and familiar meanings” (ibid.:104). Legends and memories are
equally important, as they serve their purpose when they empty themselves of their
power into space, ascribing meaning to it. These legends, memories and myths (“super-
stitions”) are “crack[s] in the system that saturate[…] places with signification”
(ibid.:106)13. They are what make space into place, what make it habitable: “[m]emories
tie us to place …. It's personal, not interesting to anyone else, but after all that's what
gives a neighborhood its character” (a woman from Croix-Rousse in Lyon, in de Certeau,
1984:108). Superstitions and the everyday practice of walking have a similar role:
“[t]ravel (like walking) is a substitute for the legends that used to open up space to
something different” (ibid.:106-107).
Cresswell sums up the conceptualisation of place that emerges when we focus on
everyday practices:
Place is the raw material for the creative production of identity rather than an a priori label of
Cresswell, 2004:39, emphasis in the original
In accordance to my social constructionist approach, this is the conceptualisation of
place that is adopted during my research. The focus on practices allows to embrace sev-
eral levels of place construction. I regard both discourse and representation as practices
that contribute in the construction of the world. Accordingly, I consider place as a con-
struct of both linguistic and non-linguistic practices. Approaching place in this open
manner allows to highlight how actors position themselves in the spatial context they
are situated in, and to make use of both interviews and participant observations in or-

identity. […] Place as an event is marked by openness and change rather than boundedness and per-
manence.

3.4.3 -  Place in a global context

der to understand how place is constructed.
Before concluding the current section on place, I want to consider place in the era of
globalisation, as this emerges as an important element from my empirical material. Sev-
eral scholars have written and debated on the role of place in a time in which time and
space are compressed by the new technologies and possibilities offered by a globalised
world. Cresswell approaches the discussion about place in a global context by referring
to the challenges that globalisation poses to place. The first challenge is posed by the
rapid emergence of global retail chains, with their almost identical shops and buildings
that can now be found in different cities worldwide. The second challenge is posed by
the circulation on the global market of previously place-bound products, such as food or
clothing, which are transported and can be purchased thousands of miles from their ori-
gin. These new developments pose a threat to place, which risks to lose its uniqueness
and to become homogeneous (Cresswell, 2004:54).
Cresswell points out how researchers have adopted different theoretical positions in
relation to the impact of globalisation on the sense of place. One of these positions is in-
troduced referring to David Harvey. Harvey conceptualises place not as something that
simply exist, but as something that is “always and continually being socially constructed
by powerful institutional forces in society” (Cresswell, 2004:57). In this view, Harvey
continues:

The process of place formation is a process of carving out 'permanences' from the flow of pro-
cesses creating spatio-temporality. But the 'permanences' - no matter how solid they may seem -
are not eternal but always subject to time as 'perpetual perishing.' They are contingent on processes
of creation, sustenance and dissolution.

Harvey, 1996:261 in Harvey, 1996:294
These “permanences”, a reaction to the fluidity of time and space in a globalised
world, imply a conceptualisation of the sense of place that British geographer Doreen

26

Theory

Massey regards as reactionary (Massey, 1991). Massey argues that this conceptualisa-
tion of the sense of place consists of three elements: a correspondence between place
and one single form of identity; a want to root place in history; and the need to set
boundaries to place to separate it from what lies outside of it (ibid.:5). This reactionary
conceptualisation is contrasted by a different view on the sense of place in a globalised
world, which is characterised by four features: the presence of multiple identities and
histories in the same place; place as being defined by the outside; the uniqueness of
place, which is characterised by its interactions; and the conceptualisation of place as
process (ibid.:6-7). The sense of place in the globalised world loses its reactionary fea-
tures to be presented as “progressive” and “extrovert” (ibid.:7).
Cresswell introduces the work of Jon May (1996), who outlines a sense of place that is
neither exclusively progressive nor exclusively reactionary, and highlights how place is
constructed and lived in different ways according to the different type of resident that
he had contact with (May, 1996 in Cresswell, 2004:75-79). Cresswell points out how
“[t]he simple, observable, fact of diversity does not necessarily produce a progressive
sense of place and the search for roots in history does not have to be reactionary”
(Cresswell, 2004:79). May points therefore towards a middle position, which has more
regard for the single individuals that populate a neighbourhood, as their different back-
grounds and histories might lead them to relate to place in opposed ways. This middle-
position is well fitting my empirical case. Throughout the analysis different conceptual-
isations of place emerge, and different groups or individuals in Vidigal perceive the
same changes as different. As I show in chapter 6, the group of newcomers that I identi-
fy as social preservationist, together with the old-timers that oppose the current
changes, have a sense of Vidigal that can be defined reactionary, as it is founded on its
past and traditions and on the boundaries that divide it from the outside. Meanwhile,
newcomers that I identify as social homesteaders, together with Vidigal's cultural elite,
construct place in a progressive manner, highlighting the openness of Vidigal and the
positive effect of the changes the favela is undergoing.

3.5 -  Gentrification

The purpose of this section is that of providing an overview of the current theories on
gentrification. Books and articles on the issue abound, as do the debates among schol-
ars. While it would be impossible to account for all that has been written since Ruth
Glass coined the term gentrification in 1964 (see Glass, 1964), this section aims at
presenting a series of key positions within The Gentrification debates (the title of a re-
cent anthology on the issue – 2010). I begin by introducing Glass' definition of gentrific-
ation, and I present discussions that focus on different aspects of gentrification. There-
after I introduce one of the debates that has often divided researchers studying
gentrification, which revolves around the question: what initiates gentrification? The
two positions that are introduced here are the so-called consumption side explanation
and the production side explanation. Finally, and in order to conclude this section, I
present a more balanced position between these two sides.
The first appearance of term gentrification is to be attributed to British sociologist
Ruth Glass, who coined the term in 1964 (Lees et al., 2008:4). Glass wrote:

3.5.1 -  What is Gentrification?

One by one, many of the working class quarters of London have been invaded by the middle
classes - upper and lower. Shabby, modest mews and cottages - two rooms up and two down - have
been taken over, when their leases have expired, and have become elegant, expensive residences. […]
Once this process of 'gentrification' starts in a district, it goes on rapidly until all or most of the ori-
ginal working class occupiers are displaced, and the whole social character of the district changed.

Glass, 1964:22-23
The term gentrification makes here its first appearance, and it carries with itself an
important notion. The displacement of the “original working class” seems inevitable, as
do the changes that the gentrifying neighbourhood will undergo (Lees et al., 2008:5).

28

Theory

American sociologist Brown-Saracino points out in the introduction to The Gentrifica-
tion Debates how definitions of gentrification can be grouped in two key areas: those
definitions that focus on its outcomes, and those that focus on its causes (Brown-Sara-
cino, 2010a:7). Nonetheless, Brown-Saracino outlines, scholars agree on gentrification's
defining attributes, which build on Glass' original definition to encompass an influx of
capital and consequent displacement and change of both the social and the physical as-
pects of a neighbourhood (Brown-Saracino, 2010b:12).
Already in the 1980s the word gentrification made its appearance in both American
and British English dictionaries, where it was strongly linked to class, as it was presen-
ted as a middle or upper class movement toward working class neighbourhoods (Smith
and Williams, 1986:1). As Brown-Saracino and Lees et al. point out, the term gentrifica-
tion has now expanded to encompass new phenomena that were not originally part of
its definition, such as rural-gentrification and super-gentrification (Brown-Saracino,
2010b:16 and Lees et al., 2008:xxi; for super-gentrification see: Lees, 2003).
Lees et al. bring the reader's attention also to the fact that gentrification is a heavily
politicised term, which is avoided in British public policy papers. Here, terms such as
“urban renaissance”, “urban regeneration”, and “urban sustainability” are preferred. In
fact, Lees et al. point out how no one wants to be in favour of gentrification, while it is
hard not to support a process of renaissance, which seems to carry a more positive con-
notation to it (Lees et al., 2008:xviii-xix). With this, the authors refer to the understand-
ing of gentrification as a term which is loaded with political meaning. As we have seen in
Glass' first definition of the process back in 1964, the term gentrification carries inher-
ently with it a negative connotation, represented by displacement of previous residents
and a change in the “social character” of the neighbourhood. Such changes are perceived
as negative as they mirror the power relations between middle and upper-class, on the
one side, and lower-class on the other. Relations in this power struggle construct and
define place, and it is most often the poor that loses, being displaced or uprooted from
the neighbourhood and seeing its sense of place disrupted. In fact, Lees et al. affirm that
gentrification is perceived, among researchers, as a negative process that causes dis-
placement and that “purifies and sanitizes the central city”. In contrast, policy makers ig-

29

nore these negative aspects and focus on the revitalisation and social balancing of
poorer neighbourhoods (ibid.:234).14 In relation to the power relations inherent in
gentrifying neighbourhoods, it is worth mentioning how British sociologists Rowland
Atkinson and Gary Bridge refer to gentrification as “a form of new urban colonialism”.
The authors argue that “[t]he geographical spread of gentrification over the last twenty
years has been reminiscent of earlier waves of colonial and mercantile expansion, itself
predicated on gaps in economic development at the national scale” (Atkinson and
Bridge, 2005:2). Elements of colonialism “as a cultural force” are to be found in gentri-
fication in its privileging whiteness and in the “white Anglo appropriation of urban
space and urban history” (ibid.). It is also at the neighbourhood level that this colonisa-
tion of urban space appears, with more privileged classes colonising lower classes' dis-
tricts. Here the outcome is not only displacement, but also distension of social networks
and services “out of sync” with the (previous) residents' needs (ibid.:2-3). Atkinson and
Bridge's connection to colonialism builds also on Smith's idea of a “new urban frontier”
(Smith, 1996). The idea of the frontier awakens memories of the conquest of the Amer-
ican Far-West, a colonial operation in itself. But it is also normative in that it places on
the one side of it a “civil class” that submits to norms for the good of the neighbourhood,
and on the other an “uncivil class”, of “savages and communists” that do not want to sub-
mit to these norms (Clay, 1979a:37-38 in Smith, 1996:17). This colonial element, I show
throughout my analysis, is one of the most interesting elements that characterise gentri-
fication in Vidigal.
The purpose of this section is that of presenting one of the most recurring academic
debates on gentrification. To the question about what triggers gentrification, two main
positions have emerged through the years and have found both supporters and critics.
These positions are often referred to as production side explanation and consumption
side explanation and they refer to “an underlying debate about culture's role in gentri-

fication, namely about whether gentrifiers' tastes and beliefs drive gentrification or
whether, once gentrification is underway, cultural objects are manipulated to appeal to
gentrifiers” (Griswold 1986 in Brown-Saracino, 2010a:7).
Lees et al. have discussed how gentrification arrived as an unexpected development,
which went against the traditional theory of urban development. In the post-war period,
urban theorists relied on the fact that city dwellers would take rational choices, thereby
moving to the better life quality promised by the suburbs. The back to the city move-
ment that gentrification represented challenged these theories (Lees et al., 2008:44-46).
With their strong Marxist background, researchers such as Neil Smith and David Har-
vey shifted the focus from consumer's (ir)rational choices to the movements of capital.
Discussing the positions of David Harvey, Cresswell points out how Harvey is concerned
with the role of capital in constructing place (Cresswell, 2004:57). Harvey highlights
how the mobility of capital contrasts with the fixity of place. This tension, he continues,
“erupts into generalized crisis” when the specific landscape in which capital had been
invested becomes a “barrier to further accumulation”. The consequence is that “[o]ld
places … have to be devalued, destroyed, and redeveloped while new places are created”
(Harvey, 1996:296; see also Zukin, 2006:107). Such a relation between capital and place
is important here, as it links theory of place with gentrification processes, and as it lays
the foundation for Neil Smith's rent-gap theory.
Smith argues for what he calls a “locational seesaw”: capital needs to “jump from one
place to another” in order to ensure enduring development (Smith, 1982:151 in Lees et
al., 2008:50). In the frames set by cities, this cannot but lead to uneven development, in
which neighbourhoods are developed, underdeveloped and redeveloped to ensure profit
and accumulation (Lees et al., 2008:50-51). The focus of this production side explana-
tion is on the movements of capital, which, due to its nature, needs to be in constant
movement. Neighbourhood change is then “driven by wider cycles of disinvestment and
uneven development thus creating new opportunities for speculation” (Atkinson,
2003:2344).

Theory

31

Part I – The Frame

Smith has developed a “rent gap theory”, that in its simplicity (see Smith, 1992:110)
aims at explaining the occurrence of gentrification in certain neighbourhoods rather
than others, focusing on the back to the city movement of capital (Smith, 1996). Smith's
theory focuses on the gap that is situated between the capitalised rent (what a landown-
er profits) and the potential rent (what could be profited). The “capitalized ground rent”,
which is what the landowner earns from the current use of land, tends to decrease as
properties lose value and are occupied by poorer tenants, who pay lower rent. On the
other hand, the “potential ground rent”, which is what the landowner could profit from
land if it was allocated to different use, might remain stable, or even grow, as a result of
other changes in the neighbourhood or in the city. When the gap is wide enough, capital,
through investment, redevelopement and the construction of new buildings, comes back
to the neighbourhood, triggering gentrification (Smith, 1996:59ff).

The consumption side explanation

While Smith understands gentrification as a back to the city movement by capital,
other authors have focused on the back to the city movement by people, contributing to
what, within gentrification theory, is called consumption side explanation to gentrifica-
tion.Atkinson presents the work of David Ley on consumer choice as central in this sphere
of the gentrification debate, and as having the same key role for consumption side the-
ory as Smith's work has for production oriented theory (Atkinson, 2003:2344). Duncan
and Ley introduce Ley's work as a research that has brought “peopling” into gentrifica-

(Duncan and Ley, 1982 in Lees et al., 2008:91). Ley's work on gentrification in Canadian
cities (1996) is a study of the new middle-class that populated inner city neighbour-
hoods in main Canadian cities. Ley's explanation to the occurrence of gentrification fo-
cuses on changing middle-class tastes that are now rooted in the youth movements of
the cultural revolution of the 1960s, a turning point in middle-class taste: “[o]nce, they
were hippies but now they are yuppies” (Lees, 2000:396). After the student movements
of the 1960s, the baby-boomers, that are now in their young adulthood, have a different
attitude towards the suburbs than their parent's generation: “[t]he standardization of
the look-alike suburbs, the superficial gloss, suggested if not the deception of the sub-
urbanite, at least a failure of personal style, the burden of a generic identity. Here was an
absence of authenticity […]” (Ley, 1996:177). Ley identifies the back to the city move-
ment of people as a reaction to this new perception of life in the suburbs. Artists emerge
in this period as brokers for middle-class taste, as they are capable of turning space into
meaningful place (ibid.:188-191) or as they become middle-class themselves (Zukin,
1988:96-100). Ley makes use of a rhetoric that is not distant from Atkinson and Bridge's
(2005), when he notes that “besides being bound to the middle class, artists are also its
advancing or colonizing arm, invading new realms of convention, style and conscious-
ness […]”; and that “[t]he urban artist is commonly the expeditionary force for inner-city
gentrifiers, pacifying new frontiers ahead of the settlement of more mainstream resid-
ents” (Ley, 1996:191). Some of these elements are familiar to the case at study in this
thesis. The coolness of the global trademark favela has in fact begun to attract new
middle-class residents to Vidigal. Interestingly, both newcomer and old-timer artists as-
sume a very similar role in Vidigal to that of brokers of middle-class values that Ley
presents.
To conclude, it is relevant to highlight how this explanation to gentrification is also
linked to American urbanist Richard Florida's theory on the 'creative class' (Florida,
2002 & 2005). This class, according to Florida made of dynamic professionals and creat-
ive workers, has been identified as the driver of urban and economic development. For

33

The complementarity explanation

this reason, city planners should brand their city in an attempt to appeal to the taste of
this class.15
The perceived dichotomy that sees production and consumption side explanations as
conflicting has been at the centre of a wide academic debate (see for example the heated
exchange between British geographer Chris Hamnett, 1991 & 1992 and Smith, 1992),
and some authors have begun to present an explanation that embraces both positions.
Hamnett and Smith both argue that they understand gentrification as a result of both
consumption and production explanations, while claiming that the counterpart does
not. Geographer Eric Clark, following up with a commentary to Hamnett and Smith's ex-
change, points out how the theory on which most of production side explanation is
based, Smith's rent-gap theory, would be nonsensical without the presence of consumer
demand, as only with the presence of latent demand would it be possible to profit from
investments in areas in which the rent-gap is low (Clark, 1992).
Atkinson is among the authors who have invited to an understanding of gentrification
processes that see its different explanation as complementary, and not mutually exclus-
ive (see also Zukin, 1987). In the introduction of the 2003 issue of Urban Studies  on
gentrification, Atkinson outlines a middle position, in which “[i]t is possible to see
gentriﬁcation as comprised of two key processes. First, the class-based colonisation of
cheaper residential neighbourhoods and, secondly, a reinvestment in the physical hous-
ing stock” (Atkinson, 2003:2343-2344). This is also the perspective that I adopt in this
research, and therefore I argue for the relevance of both positions in the understanding
of gentrification. In the case of the favela of Vidigal we can in fact see how both positions
become relevant. On the one hand, Vidigal's real estate is much cheaper than its neigh-
bouring areas, and it attracts new buyers that see the possibility of a good investment
due to the considerable rent-gap of the area. On the other hand, gentrification in the
favela is mainly driven by individual newcomers that are attracted by the area's di-

versity. This second position may appear as more in accordance with my theory of sci-
ence than the production side. Nonetheless, if we consider the production side explana-
tion in the terms outlined by Clark (i.e. the production side explanation in a consumer's
perspective), the focus on structures fades and can well work within a social construc-
tionist approach.

3.6 -  The Authentic Neighbourhood

While authenticity is a theme often discussed in slum tourism theory (for example in
Steinbrick, 2012 or in Dyson, 2012), only few studies can be found on the role that the
search for the authentic plays in processes of gentrification. Therefore, this section
builds on work by the scholar that has studied authenticity as related to the functioning
of gentrification the most: American sociologist Sharon Zukin.
Authenticity takes, according to Zukin, two different connotations. These are “features
that every generation views as “original” because they have been there throughout their
lifetimes, and features that each new generation creates on their own”. It is this “tension
between origins and new beginnings [that] produces the desire to preserve the “authen-
tic” city” (Zukin, 2010:xi). While it may be difficult for a group to be authentic in both
understandings of the term (both original and new), claiming to have understood where
the authenticity of a neighbourhood lies might be sufficient to control the advantages
that this claim carries with it. Authenticity can be made up in the form of cultural or
physical representations of what we expect to be characteristic of a specific area
(ibid.:xii-xiii). The effects that these representations have on consumers, make of au-
thenticity a tool of power, capable of “control[ling] not just the look but the use of real
urban places” (ibid.:xiii). In this understanding, a claim to see authenticity becomes a
normative claim that defines a group's moral superiority as well as it imposes the
group's taste to the neighbourhood, resulting in displacement of long-time residents
(ibid.:3-4). Displacement, argues Zukin, is a result of the changes of the spaces of con-

35

Part I – The Frame

sumption that are labelled as authentic: “the tastes behind these new spaces of con-
sumption are powerful because they move longtime residents outside their comfort
zone, gradually shifting the places that support their way of life to life supports for a dif-
ferent cultural community” (ibid.:4). It is an “ordinary domestication by cappuccino”
(ibid.), that aims at preserving the look of a neighbourhood while adapting its features
to middle-class taste and removing its dangers, in order to provide a sanitised version of
the authentic neighbourhood (ibid.:18). Neighbourhoods are presented as cool and real,
but the appreciation for the authentic is often limited to the built environment, with the
hip and cosmopolitan middle-class newcomers “indulg[e] in a collective amnesia about
the earlier eras of factory work and mass migration that made these neighborhoods
come alive” (ibid.:23). David Ley, studying gentrification in Canadian cities, points out
that during this process the entire neighbourhood changes, including the people that
live in it and the way in which the space is used, but this is still celebrated as an act of fi-
delity to the long gone soul of the area (Ley, 1996:310). Gritty becomes a synonymous of
cool (cfr. Zukin, 2010:52) and the novelist Hari Kunzru sees the reason for his arrival to
a vibrant and gentrifying area of London in the fact that “[Hackney] has a grubby glam-
our to it that has not yet been stamped out and flattened into the same cloned corporate
hell-hole as the rest of Britain” (Kunzru, 2005 in Zukin, 2008:734). Despite the new-
comers' longing for authentic neighbourhoods, interaction with the locals remains lim-
ited, as the cultural gap is often experienced as insurmountable (Anderson, 1985 in
Zukin, 1987:133 and Zukin, 2008:731). What sets long-time residents' displacement in
motion is the gentrifiers' desire for authenticity (Zukin, 2008:734). Authenticity, then, is
“a cultural form of power over space that puts pressure on the city's old working class
and lower middle class, who can no longer afford to live or work [in the gentrifying
neighbourhood]” (Zukin, 2010:xiii). Of key relevance for this thesis is that Zukin's
concept of authenticity is a social construction that says more “about us and our sensib-
ilities than about any city block” (ibid.:220; 17). In chapter 6 I make use Zukin's concep-
tualisation of authenticity to unfold the different representations of the favela that new-
comers construct. Here I show how newcomers are divided between those that perceive
the authentic Vidigal in the form of its origins, and those that regard the favela as au-

36

thentic due to its new beginnings.

Theory

3.7 -  Theory in Action

Before we venture to the methodology used in this research, I want to conclude this
chapter about theory by briefly highlighting the main concepts that I apply in the rest of
the thesis.
In line with my social constructionist approach, and as mentioned on page 23, I un-
derstand the favela as a contested place, in which competing representations mirror a
power struggle for a normative definition of the favela. In section 3.1 I argued that
“[m]eaning is […] a relational phenomenon, which can only be determined situationally
and by involving the surrounding context” (Mik-Meyer and Jaärvinen, 2005:10). This is in
accordance with the relational aspect of spatiality that emerges from the theories that I
have presented. 
It is important to acknowledge how most of the theorists that I have referred to are of
Marxist inspiration. This fact influences the way in which I look at my empirical materi-
al. Place-making emerges in this chapter as a very political process, in which the differ-
ent representations of Vidigal that I outline in the analysis have to be inscribed. Gentri-
fication, as a phenomenon that alters the social and power relations in a neighbourhood,
is both very political and, as we have seen, very politicised. In the analysis chapters this
political aspect emerges for instance when looking at the class relations between and
among newcomers and old-timers. Furthermore, it emerges in the normative aspect of
the claim to authenticity that I have presented in section 3.6.
The debates on gentrification that I have presented provide for a general understand-
ing of the phenomenon, but are also important into my analysis. As emerges from the
analysis, both production and consumption side explanations provide useful tools to un-
derstand the phenomenon of favela gentrification.
The concept of authenticity is used in my analysis to decode the claims to Vidigal that
37

Part I – The Frame

the different constructions of place carry with them. In particular in chapter 6, I present
the representations of place that emerge from newcomers and how these relate to the
concept of authenticity. Furthermore, I introduce different positions that these repres-
entations and claims make available for both newcomers and old-timers.
I present the relation between interactionism and my methodological choices more in
depth in the next chapter, which focuses on method and operationalisation. 

38

4 -  Methodology and Operationalisation

After having presented the theoretical framework for this thesis, I present in this
chapter my methodological choices. I have introduced in section 3.1 that I approach this
research with a social constructionist mindset in an interactionist perspective. While
presenting the methods employed in this research, I refer to this approach in order to
ensure the research design's consistency.

4.1 -  Single Case-study: the Favela of Vidigal

This thesis' field-work considers only one of the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, namely Vi-
digal. This favela, centrally located in the Zona Sul [South Zone] of the city, appears to be,
together with a few other favelas, one of the areas most talked about, when discussing
gentrification in Rio's favelas (see Rio On Watch, 2012b and O Globo, 2012a-b). In order
to allow for an in-depth study and analysis of the impact of gentrification on the social
relationships of the favela, I have chosen to focus on one specific and delimited area,
rather than venturing into a comparative study of different favelas.
At the outset of my research I began to discuss about my interest with acquaintances
and fellow students who live or have undergone research projects in Rio de Janeiro. The
vast majority of relevant contacts that emerged from these initial informal talks lived or
had ties to the favelas of Vidigal and Rocinha. I chose Vidigal as my case-study as reports
of favela gentrification focused more on this favela rather than Rocinha. I introduce Vi-
digal more in detail in chapter 5.

4.2 -  An Ethnographically Inspired Study

Australian anthropologist Raymond Madden defines ethnography as “writing about
people” (Madden, 2010:16). In an ethnographic research, the researcher needs to be
among the people he or she studies, in order to shape an understanding of the object at
study (ibid.). This research is inspired by ethnographic methods for what regards my
participation in favela life during field-work, and it leans on a social constructionist ap-
proach with an interactionist perspective, as has been presented in section 3.1.
The primary source of empirical material are interviews that I have conducted during
my seven-week stay in Vidigal. These are supported by participant observations and
document analysis. Mik-Meyer and Jaärvinen (2005:11) point out how the pragmatic in-
teractionist approach sees a broad spectrum of qualitative methods as desirable. This is
in line with the interactionist perspective's theoretical approach, that sees action as be-
ing shaped in interaction with the surrounding context (ibid.:10). Brown-Saracino un-
derlines how researchers often conceptualise gentrification without direct contact with
the people they study, a conceptualisation away from “the sound of hammers and saws
as workmen refurbish houses, [and] the individuals seated at a new coffee shop or bis-
tro” (2010b:14). Similarly, Atkinson and Bridge (2005:7) highlight how “there has been
more theory and less observation in recent times with perhaps not enough work to con-
nect the two and engage with pragmatic policy responses to gentrification”. In this thes-
is, through ethnographic methods, I aim at connecting these two levels.
Brown-Saracino points out how her study of gentrifers in rural and urban US has be-
nefited from a similar combination of methods. Arguing for the inclusion of participant
observation in her methodological framework, she argues that: “[w]ithout the combined
methods, we would not have a full understanding of [the object at study]. In the same
sense, interviews alone would have left us with questions about whether social preser-
vationists translate their beliefs into practice” (Brown-Saracino, 2009:49). For these
reasons, this research makes use of a combination of methods.
In the following I briefly present the different methodological tools that ethnograph-
ers such as James Spradley (1979 & 1980) and Raymond Madden (2010) have intro-

duced16. At the same time, I justify the choice of these methods placing them within the
interactionist approach presented by in Jaärvinen and Mik-Meyer's anthology (2005).
The twenty-four iterviews conducted in Vidigal are the primary source of empirical
material for this thesis. The ethnographic interview is very similar to a friendly conver-
sation (Spradley, 1979:58 and Rubow, 2010:227;234), in which the ethnographer aims
at discussing certain specific topics. The purpose of the interviews has been that of in-
vestigating my informants' production of meaning and their positioning in relation to
the changes Vidigal is undergoing. I have attempted to avoid as much as possible direct
questions about the broader social context (e.g. gentrification, class differences, etc.),
asking the informants to talk about their everyday lives and interactions within the
favela. This, in accordance to the interactionist perspective, has been an attempt to focus
on the production of meaning through which the world is shaped (Mik-Meyer and
Jaärvinen, 2005:16). In an interactionist perspective, the interview is not a “find-and-
uncover-mission”, but rather an interaction between interviewer and informant in
which also the interviewer influences the produced results (ibid.:15). Cicourel (1964:97
in Jaärvinen, 2005:28) points out how the interview is a social interaction, and it has to
be analysed as any other social encounter. Therefore, the interview has to be put in rela-
tion to the social context that has produced it. This entails both the physical context (in
the direct encounter with the interviewer) and the broader social context. During the
analysis I use these interviews as exemplifiers of broader patterns and I put my inform-
ants' words in relation to the context they are placed in. At the same time, I account for
the way in which my presence and interaction with the informants has contributed in
16 In their work, Spradley (1979 & 1980) and Madden (2010) present a wide variety of ready-
to-use tools for the practising ethnographer. These tools regard planning, performance and
analysis of interviews and observations, as well as selection of informants and of social set-
tings to be observed. In this section I only briefly introduce the key elements of their ethno-
graphic methods, while the entirety of their tools and suggestions have served as a general
inspiration in the planning of my field-work.41

4.2.2 -  Participant observations

shaping the result of the interviews. Goffman (1981 in Rubow, 2010:240) points out
how semi-structured interviews allow both the informant and the interviewer to change
positions (social identities, to use Jaärvinen's terminology [2005:30]) along the course of
the interview. Following Jaärvinen (2005:40), I focus on the unexpected, and highlight the
contradictions within my informants' words rather than flattening them out.
In order to allow a dialectic interaction with the informant and to be open to the un-
expected, while at the same time making sure to discuss some of the relevant themes for
this research, the interviews are of the semi-structured type. A copy of the inspirational
interview-guide can be found as appendix B. I present the reasons behind my choices of
informant in section 4.3.
Interviews and participant observations have taken place during a seven-week long
field-work. During this time, I have lived in Vidigal, interacting with both newcomers
and old-timers on an everyday basis and I have had the opportunity to learn to know
both the physical place and some of its inhabitants in a way that would have been im-
possible if I had lived elsewhere. With this I refer both to the ability of finding short-cuts
through the steep side alleys and to the regular informal chats with the owner of a small
bar nearby home. Furthermore, living within the favela has made it easier to establish
broader and deeper relations. This is also exemplified by having an informant such as
Bruno17, a moto-taxi driver that I met joining the by-weekly Capoeira [a Brazilian fight-
dance] lessons offered for free by the Association of residents. Likewise, living nearby
informants such as Joaño18 has given the possibility to invite and be invited to parties,
meetings and other activities that proved to be great opportunities for participant ob-
servation.
Madden (2010:78) talks about participation as a “deliberate form of association that

is targeted at gathering information germane to the research project in question”. This
form of structured “hanging out” (ibid.) is instrumental, as the researcher participates in
those social situation that can benefit the most the research project. During my field-
work, I have made use of observations for a dual purpose. Firstly, and especially in the
initial period, observations have allowed to identify elements or situations that required
further investigation. Observing interaction in a public square or at a party allowed to
develop specific questions that I could ask my informants. In these initial observations I
have taken inspiration from de Certeau's (1984) approach to place-making. As I have
presented in section 3.4.2, de Certeau focuses on the practices of everyday life, and in
particular on walking in the city, as what fills space with meaning. The initial observa-
tions had in fact the purpose of observing how both newcomers and old-timers move in
the favela, how they interact with each other in the streets, where they walk to and to do
what.Secondly, observations have allowed to follow some of the informants in their every-
day lives. As we have seen on page 40, Brown-Saracino highlights how participant ob-
servation, when linked to interviews, allows the researcher to find out if the informant's
thoughts are enacted in his or her everyday life. Likewise, I have used participant obser-
vation to follow some of my informants in their everyday lives in Vidigal. This has al-
lowed me to observe the ways in which practices intersect with positions taken in the
interview situation. To provide an example: in the analysis I highlight how, during the in-
terviews, some newcomers criticise the type of party that uses the favela as a back-
ground scenery. Nonetheless, when participating to some of these parties, I met the
same informants that had been very critical about these events. This is, among other
things, an example of the interaction that is produced between the researcher and the
informant during an interview. These informants assumed a responsible and critical po-
sition when talking to me, while in their practices they did something different.
In an interactionist perspective, participant observation gives insight into the fluidity
and instability of the analytical object and into how meaning is constructed in the field
(Mik-Meyer and Jaärvinen, 2005:15). The interactionist approach focuses on how the so-
cial context affects the interaction (ibid.:18). It investigates the institutions that set the

43

Part I – The Frame

4.2.3 -  Document analysis

frame for a social interaction and how the practices of the social interaction observed
contribute in constructing meaning about the world (Jaärvinen and Mik-Meyer,
2005b:99-100). Throughout the analysis, I indeed focus on both levels of interactionist
observation. I relate the social situations observed with the institutions that frame (and
that opens up possibilities for) the actor's everyday life. Simultaneously, I focus on how
practice in the observed social situation contribute to construct meaning about the
world and to position the informants within this world.
Finally, to support empirical material collected through interviews and participant
observations, I make use of document analysis. Newspaper and blog articles, official
documents and histories and artistic representations about Vidigal are integrated in my
analysis, in order to better understand the context in which my informants live. In an in-
teractionist perspective, documents are also seen in relation to their context. Meaning is
not inherent the document, but is constructed in relation to the external circumstances
the document is produced or consumed in. Similarly, documents are capable of influen-
cing actors, and it is therefore important to investigate their consequences in practice
(Mik-Meyer, 2005:194-195). As mentioned on page 25, I see discourse as a practice and
the world as constructed by practices. Approaching a document analysis in an interac-
tionist perspective does not necessarily mean conducting a discourse analysis, but
rather putting in relation a document with the context it has been produced and con-
sumed in.

4.3 -  Choice of Informants

The core of the empirical material gathered for this thesis consists of twenty-four in-
terviews. The informants have been chosen during my stay in Vidigal and are both new-

44

Methodology and Operationalisation

comers and old-timers. I have chosen to interview both groups as an account of the im-
pact of the arrival of newcomers on favela's social relations would have been incomplete
by presenting only one side. Focusing only on the old-timers would have allowed to ana-
lyse the impact of the recent changes, but would have lacked the dimension of the inter-
action between the two groups. Interviewing both groups allows to better understand
the different constructions and representations about the favela and how these are
played out in the everyday life. It is important to note how there is no claim to repres-
entativity in the sample of my informants. However, I have attempted to cover as good as
possible different types of residents, in order to get a more detailed picture of the case
at study. It is also worth noting that not all the twenty-four interviews are used in the
analysis. This is, more than for reasons of space, due to the fact that the analysis would
have resulted more chaotic rather than benefit from more informants. During the classi-
fication of the interviews I have identified recurring patterns in what the informants
talked about and how they did it, and I have selected the informants that better exempli-
fy the different issues which are reviewed in the analysis. The selected informants are
presented in appendix A of this thesis, and their interview transcripts are appended to
this thesis (see app. C).
Many of the newcomers felt comfortable in being interviewed in English. Nonetheless,
a few newcomers and all the old-timers preferred to speak Portuguese. When possible, I
was supported by Daniel, a Mexican American favela-resident who has lived in Brazil for
many years and who already had translating experience. However, due the difficulty of
scheduling interviews with anticipation, I have carried out some of the interviews dir-
ectly in Portuguese, without translation. A note at the beginning of each transcript high-
lights which language is the original language of the interview and whether or not a
translator was present.

Part I – The Frame

4.4 -  Entering the Field

Before continuing with the analysis of my empirical material, I briefly introduce my
position in relation to field. Madden argues for a form of “reflexivity” in ethnographic re-
search that enhances the methods used (Madden, 2010:20-23). Madden advocates for
the necessity of a reflexive approach to ethnographic studies, not with the scope of get-
ting to know more about the ethnographer, but in order to outline how the ethno-
grapher's background, features and positions influences the research. For Madden, the
ethnographer needs to achieve a form of reflexivity that “interrogates the influence of
the subjectivity and positionality of the author on the creation of the text” (ibid.:23). In
an interactionist approach, with the empirical data being shaped also in interaction with
the researcher, such an invitation to reflexivity is very actual. My interview with Timo19
emerges as an example of the importance of this reflexivity. Timo shares many of my
cultural, social, political and economical traits, and the material that emerges from our
interaction is influenced by this overlap. Timo recognises a young left-wing academic
and talks freely about gentrification as a process that causes displacement. This reflexiv-
ity also has to do with the different ways in which I positioned myself in relation to the
informants or the different social situations. While in certain situations I took upon me
the position of researcher, other times other positions might have come forward.
Jaärvinen points out how the informant in an interview will attempt to negotiate for him
or herself the most reasonable position, in order not to “lose their face” (Jaärvinen,
2005:30). In this perspective, it is no surprise, for instance, that during our interview
Joaño talks to me referring to his academic background, while when we are surfing or at a
party together, he is very informal and talks to me about parties and women.
My physical look, gender and language skills played a role during field-work. My
Mediterranean skin colour easily blends in among Brazilians, which gave the possibility,
in certain situations, to observe without being too visible myself. Nonetheless, we have
19 Timo is a German 30-year-old man who moved to Vidigal in the end of 2012. He is still em-
ployed by a German company, for which he does IT support.

46

Methodology and Operationalisation

to remember that Vidigal is a small community, and that if my skin, hair and eye colour
did not make me stand out among the crowd, it would be most unlikely to be mistaken
for an old-timer if looked upon individually. Being male had its advantages, as I never
felt intimidated when walking in the favela, something female researchers might have
experienced. Likewise, conversations in the often all-male bar crowds were for the most
free of the out-in-the-open sexual tension that is often present in Brazilian social gather-
ings. Moreover, the fact that I spoke a sufficient Portuguese already at arrival (and that it
quickly improved while in the field) allowed me to move around and converse with
favela dwellers in their own language and to both understand and participate in the
most diverse social situations.
Finally, it is important to delimit the field. Gentrification in Rio's favelas has to be in-
scribed in a broader economical and political context, which includes mega-events such
as the final of the football Word Cup in 2014 and the Olympic games in 2016. Which
such mega-events on the horizon, a wide variety of social and infrastructural projects
have also targeted some of the city's favelas. Some of these projects aim at urban rein-
tegration of these long-forgotten areas through construction of popular affordable hous-
ing (e.g. the project Morar Carioca [Live Carioca] – Cidade Olimpica, 2013), others have
focused on the security aspect. The process of pacification of the favelas (see p. 14), a
direct consequence of the mega-events coming to the city (Le Monde Diplomatique,
2013), is without doubt what has received most national and international attention in
the recent years. However, the impact of mega-events and of the process of pacification
on the favelas would deserve separate research, and it would have been impossible to
reduce the discussion to a few lines within this thesis. For this reason I consider them as
part of the context my case should be inscribed in, and not as object of analysis in them-
selves.20

on the academic literature on the issue, see Saborio, forthcoming.

4.4.1 -  Analysis Structure

In chapter 5 I shortly introduce Vidigal to the reader. I make use of empirical material
collected through interviews and observations, documents and photographs collected
during field-work, as well as a history of Vidigal written by one of my informants (Al-
meida Lima, 2010) and a theatre piece that portrays Vidigal in the 1970s. The purpose is
that of introducing the reader to Vidigal and that of accounting for the ways in which
meaning about Vidigal is constructed among old-timers. I introduce the ways in which
meaning is constructed by old-time residents, but I do not engage in an analysis of the
old-timers' representations.
In chapter 6 I engage with the first part of the research question. Here I analyse how
newcomers construct meaning about Vidigal and I highlight how different representa-
tions correspond to different understandings of what the authentic Vidigal is. Finally, I
focus on the positions these representations make available for both the newcomers and
the old-timers. Throughout the chapter I engage with the newcomers' representations,
and relate them to their practices and to the ways in which old-timers perceive these
new residents' arrival and presence.
In chapter 7 I engage with the second part of the research question. In particular, I fo-
cus on how the representations highlighted in chapter 6 and the practices of the new-
comers affect the social relations in the favela. Three themes recurrently emerged in my
empirical material, and I have structured the chapter accordingly. These themes are:
housing and displacement (section 7.1), the party scene (section 7.2) and everyday in-
teraction (section 7.3).

5 -  Vidigal

The purpose of this chapter, as explained on page 48, is that of providing the reader
with a general understanding of the case-study of this thesis.

the main road, Avenida João Goulart.

The favela this research focuses upon is the favela of Vidigal. Located in the South
Zone of Rio de Janeiro, Vidigal faces the sea and is perched up the mount Morro Dois
Irmaños. The favela borders to the rich neighbourhoods of Leblon to the east and Saño
Conrado to the west and to the north, on the other side of the mountain, to Gaévea and
Rocinha, Rio's biggest favela.
The area, originally covered by vegetation, began being inhabited at the beginning of
the 1900s by fishermen and workers of the Instituto Anglo-Brasileiro [Anglo-Brazilian
College], situated nearby. Between the 1920s and 1980s population grew, with the ar-

51

rival of migrants from other regions of Brazil and other neighbourhoods in Rio.
However, the increase in population numbers did not coincide with any improvement in
infrastructure and services. Settlement through these years saw a combination of rent-
ing, purchase of land from its legal private owners and illegal occupations. The combina-
tions of these elements have shaped a differentiated favela. The houses on the right side
of the main road Avenida Joaño Goulart, and those on Rua Nova and Rua 3 (cfr. map in
app. D), belong to residents that own the land their house is built on (app. E).
These residents pay prop-
erty taxes to the state and pay
regular bills for services such
 and  water
as electricity
(Mario21, app. C.11). On the
other hand, those residents
that have occupied their land
(to the left of Av. Joaño Goulart
and above its crossing with
Rua Nova, (see app. D) do not have property rights, besides a small minority that has re-
ceived land titles in the recent years through governmental titling projects (AP, 2012).
Vidigal emerges as a diversified favela, in which different social classes coexist. Areas
like the ones called Catorze [fourteen] or Pedrinha [small stone] are densely built and
populated, while the areas closer to the top are less dense and almost rural (see pictures
3 and 4). Residents regard the areas around Rua 3 and Rua Nova, together with three
apartment buildings near the bottom of the favela, as almost middle-class, as only the
wealthier residents could afford to live there (Mario, app. C.11). In recent years, a viol-
ent war between rivalling drug gangs from Vidigal and from the neighbouring favela of
Rocinha (see O Globo, 2006), changed the geography of the favela. The tall apartment
buildings in the lower part of the Av. Joaño Goulart were often caught on the line of fire,
pushing many middle-class residents to sell and leave Vidigal.
However, with the beginning of the pacification process in November 2011 and the

cultural offer of the Association. He was born in Vidigal 50 years ago.

arrival of the UPP in the first months of 2012 (UPP social, 2013b), prices are reported to
have grown again (field notes).
Despite the differences between the areas of the favela, residents consider Vidigal as
one entity.
According to the latest official census from 2010, Vidigal is home to 12.797 people,
41% of which under the age of 25 (Bairros Cariocas, 2010). However, residents agree on
the real number being higher, and Mario explains that the AMVV's calculates between
25.000-30.000 residents.
Vidigal has, according to
the Instituto Pereira Pas-
sos, the highest household
income   among   Rio's
favelas, with an average
  of
(in   2010)
  R$
1.744/month22,
  higher
than the neighbouring
favela of Rocinha, whose
average income is of R$ 1.291/month per household (in O Globo, 2013). While nearby
Gaévea occupies the first position in the Human Development Index among Rio's neigh-
bourhoods, Vidigal sits on the 38th place (Revista Expresso, 2013).
At the time of my field-
work (and as can be seen in
app. D), Vidigal had a wide
variety of retailers, including
one big and two smaller su-
permarkets and a sushi bar.
Besides the ample amount of
bars and restaurants, the
favela has several night clubs,

an ice factory and an ATM machine, which was installed after pacification. There is one
municipal kindergarten, a post office and a small health centre, a small ecological park
built on the side of the mountain and a sport centre called Vila Olimpica. About a hun-
dred metres from the square at the entrance of the favela, along the Avenida Niemeyer,
the beach of Vidigal (prainha [small beach] for the residents) works as a gathering point
for many residents during hot summer days, and it is shared by favela residents and by
guests of the Sheraton hotel, that projects its shade on the beach in the afternoons.
Both small private vans and a cooperative of moto-taxi transport passengers up and

connecting Vidigal to both Leblon and Saño Conrado and, with less frequency, to more
distant neighbourhoods.

5.1.1 -  A Past of Struggle

5.1 -  Old-Timers' Representations of Vidigal

During my field-work I learned how some representations of the favela are shared by
most of its old-time residents, while others are more contested. In this section, I briefly
touch upon the old-timers' representations, while I analyse more in depth the new-
comers' constructions of place in the following chapter.
A recurring representation that emerges from my old-timer informants is based on
the importance of the favela's history of resistance. Vidigal, due to its vicinity to the rich
neighbourhoods of the South Zone and to its spectacular view, has been threatened by
removal in the second half of the 1970s. A vast area of the favela close to the Avenida
Niemeyer was identified for removal, as a plan to build luxury apartments emerged. It is
in this occasion, in 1977, that the Association of residents [AMVV], was reunited after
being idle for about a decade. The AMVV began fighting for the right to stay, helped by
supporters from outside Vidigal, such as the Catholic Church and lawyers and politicians
against the ruling dictatorship. After a long and compliccated struggle, Vidigal's resid-
ents were granted the right to stay, and the area was classified as area of public utility
for social purpose, which would protect the favela from removal threats in the future
(Almeida Lima, 2010:11-23). This story is referred to by many informants as con-
stitutive of what Vidigal is today, as it united the community in a specific struggle for
survival against the government. Renato23 talks passionately about this past, while com-
paring it to the more recent changes: 

Vidigal already had a process of removals in the 70s and 80s. The bulldozers were here on the
Niemayer to kick the whole world out and transform this place in something else. Luxury apart-
ment blocks, maybe an extension of Alto Leblon. Damn! And people resisted. They resisted in here!

Part II – The Analysis

Old-timer film director Aldo24 claims that the “only good thing” about Vidigal is this
culture of resistance, which he sees as present in the place's history since the 1970s and
still characteristic of present time (app. C.1). Julio25 expresses concern about newer gen-
erations as well as newcomers not knowing the history of Vidigal, and tells me that “no
one knows Mr. Armando, that helped to found the Association, that fought for this” (app.
C.8). The fact that this history of resistance might be forgotten is perceived by Julio as a
loss of the favela's origins, as the past struggles are constituent of the favela's present.
The “Mr. Armando” Julio talks about is Armando Almeida Lima26, one of my informants
and author of the short book Resistências e Conquistas do Vidigal [Resistance and con-
quests of Vidigal – 2010]. The book, that recollects the struggles of Vidigal, with particu-
lar focus on the resistance to the removal threat in 1977, was written in 2010 for friends
and family. The author explicitly expresses his goal: many of the main actors of those
past events are old or have passed away; the book aims at ensuring that the history of
Vidigal will be carried from one generation to the next (Almeida Lima, 2010:16). The
resistance against removal is also portrayed in the theatre piece Bandeira de Retalhos
[Patchwork flag], produced by the Vidigal theatre company Nós do Morro [Us from the
Hill27] and written in 1979 by the musician and composer Seérgio Ricardo (Noés do Morro,
2013), who lived in Vidigal at the time. The piece offers a representation of Vidigal's life
in the 1970s, and portrays the resistance of its inhabitants to the removal threat. Both
Almeida Lima's book and the theatre piece represent the past of Vidigal, which is con-
sidered as central to understand what Vidigal is today. By focusing on the history of
struggle of the community, they both inscribe Vidigal's past into the rhetoric of a com-
munity of struggle. 
24 Aldo is a 34-year-old film director, born and raised in Vidigal. 
25 Julio is a 27 year old photographer, born and raised in Vidigal. He is active in the community,
and I read about him in an interview he gave the blog Rio on Watch (2011c).
26 Armando Almeida Lima, is a 71 years old resident who has lived in Vidigal since 1959. He
works as a house mover and is former President of the AMVV.
27 Morro, literally meaning 'hill', is often used as a synonymous of favela, due to the numerous
favelas perched on Rio's hills.

56

In 1980 Pope John Paul II was to visit one of Rio's favelas during his official visit to the
city. The archdiocese, that had supported the residents struggle against the regime,
chose Vidigal, due the level of organisation of the community and to the significance of
the recently won struggle (Almeida Lima, 2010:23). Almeida Lima writes with pride that
Vidigal's struggle was the first public protest against the regime, and claims that it is this
struggle that triggered the political opening of the country that was to come in the fol-
lowing years (ibid.:17-18).
This history is also celebrated in the names given by the AMVV to Vidigal's roads, that
were named after people who took part in the resistance of these years. Tuan
(1991a:688 in Cresswell, 2004:98) argues that “naming is power – the creative power to
call something into being, to render the invisible visible, to impart a certain character to
things”. Likewise, naming Vidigal's roads after participants of the resistance against re-
moval attributes them an historical role, and makes this history of resistance part of a
collective past that contributes in shaping the present. Renato, recalls an episode of
struggle from his youth, which is also portrayed in the film 5x Favela – Agora por Nós
Mesmos [5x favela – Now by Ourselves] (2010), and links the history of struggle to the
sense of community. Facing an electricity shortage on Christmas day, residents blocked
the technician of the electricity company inside the favela, not allowing him to leave be-
fore their electricity connection was restored. In this, says Renato, “the union of Vidigal
is represented” (app. C.13).
The presence of a sense of community emerges often when talking to old-timers, al-
though it does so in different ways. The lack of infrastructure and of government inter-
vention to improve favela's life standards is seen as what shaped this sense of com-
munity, as residents had to get by on their own (Aldo). Bruno (app. C.2) explains that
community means “knowing how to live close to one another”, and helping each other
with their everyday life problems. This understanding is shared by the majority of old-
timers. However, Renato points out that it is impossible to have a unity of all residents

57

Part II – The Analysis

and that there are internal divisions in the favela, a view shared by Bruno, and that we
have seen is part Massey's conceptualisation of the sense of place (cfr. 3.4.3). Julio and
Rita28 are more pessimistic. According to them, the sense of community has long van-
ished, as things rapidly changed after the first struggles and the first achievements. In
particular, Julio blames the disruption of community organisation caused by drug traf-
ficking. Rita does not deny the existence of stronger ties among favela residents than the
ties between neighbours in other areas of Rio. However, she laughs when reporting how
one of her foreign friends claims that Vidigal is special because of the sense of com-
munity: “The way of life and communicating here makes that people think 'Wow, what
humble people, what great people' - yeah, come and live here. Jessica [a newcomer]: ask
her, she will say 'Oh Vidigal? I love Vidigal, wow Vidigal.' For her everything is new”
(app. C.15). According to Rita and Julio, the sense of community is now only a myth from
the past.

rooms of the shop.

5.1.3 -  The Cultural Favela

Vidigal

A similar division among old-timers emerges also when discussing the role of culture
and arts in Vidigal. While a few old-time residents claim that these elements have been
the key in the development of Vidigal, others have the opposite opinion. Julio (app. C.8)
argues that the emergence of the cultural side of Vidigal contributed to residents forget-
ting “the human side”, and that the representation of Vidigal as creative favela is unfoun-
ded: “Vidigal is dead, empty, there is nothing. They want to sell a place that is vibrant in
beauty and culture, but there is nothing!”. Both Julio and Rita criticise the role of the
theatre company and school Nós do Morro. The company receives much national and in-
ternational attention, and I have for instance met various European journalists attend-
ing the theatre's performance to write about them (field notes). The school has formed
several generations of actors, and it is not uncommon, when residents talk about Vi-
digal's creativity, to hear references to Vidigal residents that have acted as main charac-
ters in films (for example City of God, see Vidiga!, 2013b): Cidade de Deus eé Aqui; avail-
able at:) or soap operas. The presence of the theatre seems to give pride to many
residents, as it has brought attention to what Frisch calls the idealised discourse about
the favela, rather than to the problem centred one (cfr. Frisch, section 3.3). Nonetheless,
critics such as Rita and Julio argue that the presence of the theatre does not bring any
benefit to the majority of Vidigal's residents: people began “selling [the] image of the
[cultural favela]. Vidigal is cultural, but, well great, cultural for whom? What type of cul-
ture?” (app. C.8). 
Despite the internal differences, most old-timers construct their representation of Vi-
digal in opposition to the neighbourhoods outside of it. Also among those old-timers
that are most critical about the presence of a sense of community, it is recognised that
social ties in the favela are tighter than in other areas of Rio (cfr. Rita). Such dichotomy
between the favela and the outside is also to be attributed to the stigmatisation of
favelas that has characterised public discourse about these areas. Danilo (app. C.3) af-

firms that “the Brazilian hates the favela. People with money from Leblon, Ipanema […]
don't like the poor”. Discussing this stigmatisation of favelas, Danilo recalls a story from
his childhood: 

Part II – The Analysis

I studied in a middle-class school, a private school. And I was […] probably the only one that lived
in a favela. […] I had a friend that lived in Viera Souto, which was one of the most expensive places
in Rio de Janeiro. They would tell me that I couldn't tell their parents that I lived in a favela, because
their parents wouldn't let me play with them any more.

Danilo, app. C.3
Similarly, Bruno (app. C.2) talks about how favela residents are often looked upon
with suspicion when they are in other areas of the city: “[when favela residents] get
down there […], until we open our mouths we are just favelados [favela dwellers, with a
negative connotation to it]”. His clothing and his slang, says Bruno, attract negative at-
tention by the rest of society, and it is only when he explains he works as a moto-taxi
driver that they would understand that he is not the kind of person that they thought he
was.In this situation, the arrival of the UPP seems to have had an important impact. Such
stigmatisation seems to have been weakened as favelas are perceived as more accessible
with the presence of police units. Renato (app. C.13) explains that after pacification it is
possible to take a taxi home, while before he had “to ask beforehand 'Hey! Do you take
me up there in Vidigal?' and they didn't take people in here. You could take ten taxis and
not one would say yes”. Danilo (app. C.3) concludes his story with an irritated acknow-
ledgement of the fact that it took pacification for the rest of society to see favelas in a dif-
ferent light: “the fun thing is that today, the same group of people that speaks bad about
the favela, […] that says that only thieves and criminals live in the favela […], now loves
the favela [spits on the ground]”.
In this section I have highlighted how the favela is constructed by its old-time resid-
ents. The goal was not that of providing an analysis of these constructions, but rather
that of providing the reader with a general knowledge on the favela as landscape and as

60

Vidigal

place, in which the rest of my research is to be inscribed. An interesting anticipation can
be made here. In the following chapter I present and analyse the ways in which new-
comers construct the favela. The same elements that have emerged among the old-
timers appear in the representations of the newcomers: resistance, arts, community.
However, these representations, when adopted by newcomers, are used as tools to claim
their own right to Vidigal, as well as defining a series of normative practices in the
favela. I present these themes more in depth in the following chapter.

61

I could have found probably an appropriate room in
the concrete city, as I call it. […] But it was more expens-

stay somewhere where I am absolutely anonymous. […]

Timo, app. C.18
These opening quotes from Timo, one of Vidigal's newcomers, refer to the reasons
that made him move to Vidigal. Several themes emerge at first glance, such as the sense
of community and that of a life that resembles the average life in Brazil. As introduced in
section 4.4.1, in this chapter of the analysis I focus on the arrival of newcomers to Vidig-
al, on the way the favela is constructed as authentic place and on the positions that these
different constructions offer both newcomers and old-timers. In order to structure the
chapter, it is divided into two main sections. In the first part I outline what attracts a

62

Chasing the Real: Place Construction and Authenticity

new type of resident to Vidigal and in which ways the favela is constructed as place.
Analysing the process of arrival provides me with considerable help in understanding
how meaning about the place favela is constructed among newcomers, and what role
authenticity plays in it. The second part of this chapter focuses on the positions made
available by the representations of the favela that have emerged in the first part.

6.1 -  Constructing Vidigal:
Community, Authenticity and Class

In this part of the analysis, I investigate the newcomers' representations of the favela.
Talking with my informants, I have asked about their reasons for moving to Vidigal, as
well as their reasons for staying. By doing this, I invited the informants to talk about
what they like about Vidigal, and to highlight what they considered as the salient ele-
ments that characterise the favela. As I have presented on page 25, I understand place as
constantly constructed both through language and practice. Therefore, I support my in-
terviews with participant observation, that have focused on the newcomers' practices.
These provide valuable insight in the ways in which meaning about Vidigal is construc-
ted.To begin with, I present two stories of arrival, that exemplify how and why new-
comers move to Vidigal. 
The paragraph's opening quotes sum up Timo's arrival and his reasons for staying in
Vidigal. Timo lived in Berlin and wanted to move to Rio de Janeiro because of his fascin-
ation with Brazilian music and culture. Already before his arrival in Rio, he had read and
heard about Vidigal: “since it's a rather popular artist favela too, there was more online
to find than […] any of the other margin favelas”. Timo thought that Vidigal would be
more welcoming than a favela in the outskirts of town, where someone “like [him]”, who

Part II – The Analysis

does not come from the community, would have a harder time and often feel unsafe.
Upon arrival in Rio, Timo spent the first two weeks living with some friends in Barra da
Tijuca, a neighbourhood in the West Zone of Rio de Janeiro. These friends were living
“the Brazilian middle-class life, with the luxury, [the privileges] they have you know?
Car, better electricity, and house”, and Timo, that throughout the interview criticizes the
inequalities of the Brazilian society, “consciously chose Vidigal then, instead of any other
small room more down town.” Timo fears he would be entirely anonymous if he lived in
what he calls the “concrete city”: he would not know his neighbours or be part of a com-
munity. He then chooses Vidigal with an expectation that life there will be different, that
people will be more welcoming and will not live together by “coincidence” (app. C.18).
Hugo largely shares Timo's positions and reasons for living in Vidigal, despite a very
different process of approaching the favela. The French hairdresser and make-up artist
explains that he has come to Vidigal several times in a period of 8-9 years, particularly
after he moved from London to the small town of Saquarema, about 100 km outside of
Rio de Janeiro. During these visits he was doing voluntary work with the Vidigal-based
theatre company Nós do Morro, and he built friendships within the community. He re-
calls from his first visit: “I don't know if I would have come here if I wouldn't have come
through a friend of mine”. And he continues: “[a]ll the Brazilians were like: […] 'Are you
going to the favelas?'. It was […] a really big thing. I didn't want to expect anything […]
'I'm with my friends and everyone is going to be safe'” (app. C.6).
When he had to move to Rio because of work, in 2011, Hugo was not in doubt about
where he should live: “I had to come to Rio, and I found a job in Leblon. And it was […]
'Where am I gonna stay?' […] 'Vidigal, obviously!'. It was next to Leblon, and down
[there] it's so expensive” (ibid.). As in Timo's case, Hugo, explaining why he chose Vidig-
al instead of Leblon or another neighbourhood, begins by referring to economic reasons.
However, as in Timo's case, the economical level is far from the only reason, as other
factors seem to be more important. Hugo is very enthusiastic about Vidigal and its sense
29 Hugo is a 45 year old French hair-dresser and make-up artist. He has lived in Vidigal since
2011.

64

Chasing the Real: Place Construction and Authenticity

of community, and he expresses this enthusiasm several times throughout the inter-
view: “It was good to be able to come to Vidigal, and this community is unbelievable. I
love it. They are very […] together”. And again:

Yeah because it's this… there is an energy here. There's definitely something in the air, an energy.
[…] The fact of being in Vidigal and to have the privilege, this opportunity to be really in the com-
munity, completely merging, be in this group of people so talented and so special for me. […] it's so
stunning, and I am like 'Thank you!' […] Sometime it's hard, sometime a moment is really difficult,
but the good moment make for the bad one.

Hugo, app. C.6
That the economical factor is not the key in Hugo's decision of living in Vidigal is
made clear when he begins describing what type of newcomer has moved to Vidigal in
the recent years: “People [moving in are] people that can afford it [and] don't have [pre-
judice]. […] People are pretty alternative, people are pretty urban. [They have] enough
money but… like me, I don't want to be living in Leblon, Ipanema or Copacabana. Even if
I could afford it, I don't think I'd be living there” (ibid.).
Vidigal is then no second choice, but it is the place where he wants to be living in.
Hugo introduces us also to the type of newcomer that is moving to Vidigal, which he
identifies as “pretty alternative”, “pretty urban” types. I expand more on this theme in
the final part of this section.
What emerges through the account of these informants' arrival is that despite the dif-
ferent personal paths that bring newcomers to live in Vidigal, there are recurring pat-
terns when looking at what it is that attracts them and how they construct meaning
about the favela. The possibility of living in a community of people that is different from
the rest of Rio appears as a recurring element in what newcomers like about Vidigal.
Paul30 (app. C.12), a French newcomer, expresses this feeling very clearly: “I have trav-

Part II – The Analysis

elled for few years in Brazil, but I found in Rio all of Brazil concentrated. In Vidigal it is
pretty much like the countryside. […] If it was Leblon or Ipanema I wouldn't have
bothered to come here really. It's too much like Europe or America”. In a somewhat sim-
ilar way, Vidigal represents for Timo (app. C.18) a place where he can avoid anonymity
and have a more “town or villagey feeling” in contrast to the “concrete city”; Hugo (app.
C.6) “love[s]” the community and in “London or Paris [he has] never been so grateful”;
and British make-up artist Ida31 mentions several differences between Vidigal and Lon-
don that amuse her, such as having neighbours visiting without the need to make ap-
pointments, living in a tree hut made of recycled materials and in general the feeling of
living in a community where people know and help each other.
While newcomers praise almost unanimously the feeling community, I have pointed
out in section 5.1.2 how some old-timers do not perceive Vidigal as a tight community.
Many examples of the sense of community emerge through the old-timers' accounts,
such as people helping each other in building a house or taking care of the ill. However,
old-timers such as Julio or Rita refer to the sense of community as a memory of the past,
and deny its existence in today's Vidigal. Nonetheless, newcomers tell they have arrived
to Vidigal as they perceived it different from where they used to live. Reneé, a French
newcomer that has lived in Vidigal since 2008, tells that he came back to Rio after his ex-
change program as he had grown tired of Paris. Similarly, 25-year-old American new-
comer Lisa32 spells out the contrast between life in Vidigal and in a Western metropolis: 

[Vidigal] was more welcoming. I felt like why go live down there in the city if I can go live in New
York  or  Chicago  or San Francisco, other than  it  being  by the beach.  To me…  I'm not  seeing that
much of a difference in city terms. Like the neighbours don't know each other, you know?

er in a language school. Together with her Brazilian husband from Rocinha, she sometimes

perched.

66

Chasing the Real: Place Construction and Authenticity

Brazilian newcomer Joaño, surfer and Harvard graduate, also shares this view, and
presents it in a more academic tone. While presenting theories of bonding versus
bridging of social capital, he states that in neighbourhoods such as Copacabana or Ipan-
ema people do not know each other and live in fear, while inside the favela residents
bridge social capital, showing interest and engagement in each other's lives. This can be
good or bad, says Joaño, but it is a consequence of the fact that Vidigal has been aban-
doned by the state for so many years, and people “had to take care of each other” (app.
C.7).In section 3.4.3 I have introduced different approaches to the conceptualisation of
place in a global context. Paul, Lisa and Timo point out that other areas of Rio are not
worth moving to, as they are no different from Paris of New York. Considering the risk of
time and space compression in the globalised world presented by Harvey, it is no sur-
prise that a place that is still perceived as authentic or unspoiled, can be seen as attract-
ive. Vidigal becomes attractive, as for decades it has been neglected by both the state
and private investors, while it has kept its premium location and a sense of community.
The different informants want to escape what they perceive as the homogenised
neighbourhoods or cities they come from, and move to a place that they feel maintains
its sense of locality. The understanding of community that emerges from these new-
comers' accounts is very similar to the romanticisation of community that Brown-Sara-
cino (2004) highlighted in her study about social preservation. Brown-Saracino high-
lights how some newcomers “associate[…] community with individuals bound together
by shared religion, ethnicity, race, class, and—most importantly—way of life. Specific-
ally, they equate the economic and social struggle of marginalized groups with strong
social ties”. This is the same view of community that can be found in the accounts of
many of my informants. In fact, for these informants meaning about Vidigal is construc-
ted in opposition to what lies outside of the favela (i.e. Rio's other neighbourhoods), or
to the places the informants come from. Vidigal is seen as something different from
what is “down there”, to use the words of Lisa.

Part II – The Analysis

6.1.2 -  Looking for the Special Place Favela

Besides the fascination for the sense of community, newcomers tend to construct rep-
resentations of the favela as authentic place. In this section I highlight how the perceived
authenticity of Vidigal attracts newcomers.
Timo is very clear about the fact that his choice of living in Vidigal allows him to ex-
perience something different:

People just lead their everyday fights with the not perfect infrastructural condition here. And as
everybody knows that's what the majority in Brazil does, and that keeps you rather closer to the […]
problems or the issues of a society like Brazil. […] [L]iving with [power] cuts if it starts raining, and
stuff like that, it is normal to everybody here as in most other parts of Brazil probably.

[…]

And that makes it more authentic then, because if your house has [a power] cut too, then you get
into feeling how it is if you suddenly can't use your internet but you actually had the plan to do it.
[…] [T]hat changes your life in  very  small parts but it changes it, and the conscious[ness] about
everything you have.

Timo, app. C.18
Timo reports these experiences as something full of excitement, and looks at the pos-
itive consequences of them. At the same time he points out how these situations of need
are not unusual in Brazil, where “the majority” of the people has to live in the same con-
ditions. Living in a community with infrastructural lacks such as Vidigal is in contrast
with the life Timo had in Berlin, but also with the life his friends in Barra da Tijuca live.
It is interesting to note that, in order to seek this authentic way of living, Timo, as well as
the other foreign newcomers, has not only to cross the ocean, but also to move to one
specific part of Rio. Undoubtedly many of Rio's inhabitants live in favelas, and many are
poor. However, the definition of what is average in Brazil is a construction in itself. Fur-
thermore (see pp. 70 & 79), it is a romanticisation of favela life, stripped of its most neg-
ative elements.

68

Chasing the Real: Place Construction and Authenticity

Timo does not see himself as having a middle-class background. However, he admits
that he has grown up with the “privileges of someone living in Germany”, meaning good
education and the possibility of travelling. Due to these privileges, he admits he is to be
considered middle-class, when compared to Brazilian standards. Timo has chosen Vidig-
al because he wanted to experience something that would bring him closer to the aver-
age Brazilian, but he has had the possibility of taking a conscious choice about where to
live. As he says, he chose Vidigal because life there would be easier for him than “other
margin favelas” (app. C.18). The connotation of “margin favelas” can be interpreted as
referring to those favelas that are not as centrally placed as Vidigal, but also as more
marginal in that their inhabitants are more uniformly lower-class. As we have seen
above (see p. 63), it is the presence of artists that attracts Timo to Vidigal, rather than to
a favela of the poorer and less charming North Zone of Rio.
Also Joaño names the difficulties of living in a favela: poor mobility, poor internet and
disastrous mobile phone coverage. Having written his master thesis at Harvard on
favelas and the pacification process, Joaño repeats several times and with a smile, both to
me during our interview and to others while I am present, that it is only now that he
lives in Vidigal, that his master program can be considered concluded, as he has experi-
enced himself what it means to live in a favela (field notes). As we can see from the
quote reported on page 65, Hugo has a similar approach. He argues that it is sometimes
hard to adapt to life in a favela, due to the lack of infrastructure and services. However,
the thrill of living in such a location as Vidigal “makes up for the bad” things. In a cri-
tique of gentrification, Niel Smith (1992:114) has pointed out how “preference is an in-
herently class question”. The point here is that Timo as well as Joaño, Hugo and the other
newcomers, had a choice, and that what they find fascinating (the electricity cuts and
the water that goes by fits and starts), would unlikely be as fascinating to an old-timer
that was born in Vidigal. In fact, while Joaño mentions with a smile the precarious condi-
tions of the phone network, old-timer Renato identifies the improvement of these same
services as one of the few positive consequences of the pacification, and at the same
time he mocks the newcomers' interest for the poor favela. Zukin, talking about the
concept of authenticity, points out how it is a concept that inherently belongs to 'out-

69

Part II – The Analysis

siders', as most of us would not talk about the neighbourhood in which we have grown
up using the word authentic (Zukin, 2010:20). The old-timer Danilo (app. C.3), mocking
those newcomers who move to the favela because it is cool and underground, asks rhet-
orically: “Why don't they go and live in Complexo de Alemaño [Rio's biggest complex of
favelas]? Isn't it a favela as well? Why don't they go live in Jacareé [one of Rio's most dan-
gerous favelas]? They also have the UPP. […] Why don't they? Because the South Zone is
here. Got that?”. Here Danilo confronts the newcomers' approach to Vidigal. If they want
to experience the authentic favela life, he asks, why not go to the favelas of the North
Zone, without the view and the privileges Vidigal has? Danilo reports a conversation
with newcomer Rosa33, one of my informants and editor of the blog Vidiga! (2013a). The
two were discussing the imminent arrival of the UPP, and Danilo recalls (app. C.3): “[She
said:] 'imagine it's going to be cool, it's not going to be so crazy any more', and I said
like: 'dude you are from Saño Paulo, not from Rio. You are coming here to live now'”.
Later in our interview, Danilo argues that most newcomers would run away, if the traf-
fickers came back. To answer the question above then, we may answer that newcomers
come to Vidigal because it offers a sanitised version of that favela life they regard as
cool, while allowing a lifestyle and life standard that do not depart very much from the
middle-class lives they come from. Despite the claims of wanting to get in touch with the
authentic Brazil, with the majority, the newcomers adopt a lifestyle that is still that of
the minority. Living in the favela is, to some extent, a game, a thrilling experience that
they want to try out.
The focus on the authenticity of favela life emerges through Timo and other inform-
ants' words. The favela is constructed as different (one might even say 'exotic') from
their home-towns and the rest of Rio. This is what attracts newcomers.
The perception of what is authentic about Vidigal is very tightly connected with the
way in which newcomers construct meaning about the favela and with their reasons for
moving to Vidigal. In the following sections I present different representations of the
favela that emerge from newcomers' accounts, and I connect these representations to

a freelance journalist. She is 30 years old and she has lived in Vidigal since 2011.

6.1.3 -  The Favela and its History

the different forms of authenticity that newcomers identify in Vidigal.
As we have seen, newcomers share a construction of meaning made in opposition to
the “down there” and put emphasis on the particularity of Vidigal and of its community.
However, differences emerge when we look at what kind of meaning they give to the
community.
Joaño, Reneé, Paul and Timo refer to Vidigal's history, and while Timo is less direct in his
formulations, the others clearly refer to a history of struggle. Joaño, refers to the “very
strong activist history” of Vidigal as something that could safeguard older residents
from displacement (app. C.7), and Paul places himself outside the community, as the
community is shaped by those that built Vidigal and fought for their rights. Both Reneé
and Joaño stand out among the newcomers for having a more critical view than others on
what the community is, as they also highlight conflicts internal to Vidigal. Joaño names as
the “major learning” of his experience in Vidigal the fact that he realised how “many
people generalise that all poor favelados are good, while in reality there are generous
people, assholes and what not” (ibid.). However, neither Joaño nor Reneé deny the exist-
ence of a shared sense of community among the residents of Vidigal. During our inter-
view, Reneé (app. C.14) explains that a favela is more than lower-class people living in the
same area: “it has a political side in people's attitude. A side like… everyone is united
more or less, united against the government. The enemy is the state”.
In section 3.4.2 we have seen how de Certeau (1984:106) regards memories and oth-
er “superstitions” as “crack[s] in the system that saturate[…] places with signification”.
Similarly, Joaño and Reneé's references to a past of struggle can be interpreted as an opera-
tion that ascribes meaning to Vidigal. It is through this representation of Vidigal that the
two informants, to use de Certeau's terminology, make Vidigal habitable. Furthermore,
Joaño and Reneé point out that there are conflicts and divisions in Vidigal, but that there is,
or at least there has been, a form of unity when Vidigal had to confront the threats com-
ing from the outside. As I have anticipated in the end of section 5.1, there is an interest-

Chasing the Real: Place Construction and Authenticity

71

Part II – The Analysis

ing difference that needs to be pointed out between the representation of Vidigal as a
place of struggle made by the newcomers and that made by the old-timers. The old-
timers articulate the favela's history of struggle as a way of claiming the right to live
where they live. They (or their parents and grandparents) have struggled and suffered
to build and protect their homes. As a result of this history, they claim that no one has
the right to live there more than themselves. The articulation of Vidigal's history presen-
ted by the newcomers does not differ in form, but it does in regard to the claim of who
has the right to live on the morro. In the articulation of newcomers the reference to Vi-
digal's history implies that they have understood the essence of Vidigal, and therefore
they have the right to be there. This is not so much a claim that contrasts the old-timers'
one, but more a claim that norms what type of other newcomers can come to Vidigal and
to do what. I investigate the link between this type of claim and the understanding of
what the authentic Vidigal is in the following section.
The informants who refere to Vidigal's history of struggle are fascinated by the au-
thentic Vidigal in the form of its origins, to use Zukin's terminology (see section 3.6), and
lay a normative claim to Vidigal from this perspective. Resistance against the state and
the fact that Vidigal is a lacking community that had to survive and develop with its own
strengths are identified as those features that have always been there and therefore con-
tribute in defining what is authentic about Vidigal. For instance Joaño, as we have seen
above, refers to the history of Vidigal as a hope against gentrification. In the same sen-
tence, Joaño lays claim to Vidigal. The Brazilian surfer praises Vidigal's activist past and at
the same time criticises those newcomers that do not give to the community, but just
use it. While doing this, he positions himself as a newcomer that has understood the
true meaning and soul of Vidigal, in opposition to the practices of other newcomers.
Lisa's account of the relations with other foreigners, seems to suggest that this feeling
of authenticity is spoiled precisely by the arrival of newcomers:

6.1.4 -  Vidigal's Origins

72

Chasing the Real: Place Construction and Authenticity

There is this weird vibe I get from foreigners who are here. Since the beginning, since I have been
here, any other foreigner that sees me […], look[s] at me as if like they own the rights to be here and
who am I? Like they were first. I think that's bizarre. 'You were not here first. These other people
were here first, you would have never been here first'.

Lisa, app. C.10
To say 'I was here first' is a claim to authenticity. At the same time, the weird looks
from foreigners that I have myself experienced in different occasions, seem to say 'I am
true to this place's authenticity, and I am sure you are not'. As Lisa says herself, it implies
that someone has more right to Vidigal than others, as they have claimed the authenti-
city of the place (see Zukin 2010:xii). Ironically, foreigners are disturbed by the presence
of other foreigners, as this contaminates the exoticism of the favela scenery. To live in Vi-
digal is cool, as long as not everyone does it. These informants' construction of Vidigal is
that of a ready for consumption version of the favela, where the favela carries a 'where-
no-white-man-has-set-foot-before' kind of coolness. What emerges is that due to this
representation of the authentic favela, newcomers arriving to Vidigal contribute in spoil-
ing that same special place that they had crossed the ocean to find. The isle of authenti-
city is ruined as soon as the 'white man' sets its foot in it. Nonetheless, newcomers have
often mixed feelings about these changes. Paul falls into a contradiction when, while
wanting to preserve Vidigal's origins, opens up to its new beginnings:

I doubt it will become like Beverly Hills. I think it's becoming more expensive, more expensive […]
and it's gonna become more like Santa Teresa. More lively. The thing of Vidigal and the thing of the
favela is that it's full of young people, and even foreigners which come there, most of the people are
quite original, I think. They like parties, they like noise, they like the originality. I hope and I think
it's not going to become Beverly Hills.

Paul, app. C.12
Paul fails in recognising his and the other newcomers' role in the changes happening
in Vidigal, and hopes that their arrival will not spoil what had made Vidigal special.

73

Part II – The Analysis

6.1.5 -  Vidigal as the Creative Favela

The other representation of Vidigal that emerges through the interviews with new-
comers is best analysed using the words of Hugo and Ida.
When talking about Vidigal, both informants mention the vibrancy of the art and fash-
ion scene inside the community, as key elements of what they appreciate about Vidigal.
As presented on page 65 Hugo talks about the “energy” that can be felt in the air, and
states that it is a privilege to be “merging [with] […] this group of people so talented and
so special for me”. At the same time he talks with pride about several events that he has
either participated in or being part of arranging. These include photo shoots with pro-
fessional models, music videos and commercials with famous Brazilian and internation-
al musicians (such as members of the band Black Eyed Peas), the work of the theatre
Nós do Morro and parties that mix all of these elements. One of these events, the party
Mistura Tropical [Tropical Mixture], aimed at showing how Brazil is a mixture of differ-
ent people and histories. Hugo explains:
just do an evento [a happening] […] in Vidigal, 'I am
going to call it Mistura Tropical' […]. We got three

people who are curious […] and it really worked.

Hugo, app. C.6
Ida is part of the production of the same and of similar other events (as Hugo reports)
and she refers to the meeting with the artistic and fashionable side of Vidigal as what
she found most exciting about the favela at her arrival. Similarly, Hugo regards the artist-
ic aspect of the favela as what impressed him the most. Ida and Hugo seem to appreciate
Vidigal because of the presence of artists and the possibilities that this open for the two
of them, who share an interest in fashion and are both make-up artists. What is revealed
to be attractive for the two informants is very different from the possibility of getting in
touch with the 'poor', which was what Timo or Joaño highlighted. In fact, in an event such
as Mistura   Tropical,
various   elements
are far from being
the  
stereotypical
elements of a com-
munity in need. The
event is arranged in
one of the very few
houses in Vidigal
that has an actual
garden, and prob-
ably the only one that has a pool in it. Its declared purpose is that of giving visibility to
favela artists, and the “encontro [meeting]” is imagined between these artists and people
from the outside, who are eager to encounter favela art and artists. As we have seen in
section 3.5.2, David Ley has identified the role of artists as brokers of middle-class taste
(Ley, 1996:188-191). Artists, Ley pointed out, are the middle-class's “advancing or col-
 invading new realms of convention, style and consciousness […]”
onizing arm,
(ibid.:191). Hugo, Ida and the organiser of the event Vanessa take upon themselves a
very similar role in this attempt to bring favela art to Rio's “curious” middle-class. They
do this by building on the cultural capital of the favela and by canalising it and interpret-

Picture 9: Street art in Vidigal/1

75

Part II – The Analysis

ing it in a way that can appeal to the middle-class. In fact, the setting they choose, the
garden with the pool and the rock, is very middle-class. The event does not show the
poorer areas of Vidigal, but rather creates a bubble that can be consumed by outsiders
in its independence. As I point out in section 7.2.3, Renato, despite his involvement in
the arts through Nós do Morro, complains precisely about the isolation of some of these
events from the rest of the favela. To the second edition of Mistura Tropical, to which I
had the opportunity to attend, the participating crowd was exclusively composed by act-
ors from the theatre, those newcomers most in contact with the art scene, and a some-
how homogeneous blend coming from outside Vidigal. There were creative and eccent-
ric types as well as professionals – such as my informant Rosa, a journalist – and
academics – like Joaño, together with a small group of his visiting Harvard friends –, most
of them in their late 20's and early 30's. No lower-class old-timer was present, and even
the bar was run by an Italian bartender. If not for the hot and humid weather in the
middle of January and for the predominance of caipirinhas (the most popular Brazilian
drink) in the bar, one could have been in doubt if this was Rio or any other creative city
in the world. Nothing at this event indicated that it was taking place in a favela (field
notes, January 20th, 2013). This crowd of participants is what Hugo (as we have seen on
p.65), presented as pretty alternative urban types. Ley's (1996) gentrifiers of Vancouver
and other Canadian cities, Zukin's (2010) gentrifiers of Williamsburgh and even Richard
Florida's (2002 & 2005) creative class appear to match the characteristics of the parti-
cipants of Mistura Tropical, and, following Hugo's lead, the type of newcomer that is
moving to Vidigal in these years. Lees et al. encourage us to “understand the broader
mechanisms that allow some people to become gentrifiers, whilst others will never
stand a chance of becoming 'professionalized' and simply feel the negative effects of pro-
fessionals moving into low-income neighborhoods” (Lees et al., 2008:123-124). This
statement invites to look at class as a key factor to understand gentrification processes.
In the case of Vidigal, class distinctions are what brings Hugo or Ida to enjoy Vidigal as
an artist community and to invite middle-class people to their event, while no lower-
class favela resident is present. 
The representation of Vidigal as an artistic favela is again criticised by some old-

76

Chasing the Real: Place Construction and Authenticity

timers. In particular, Julio regards the kind of culture the theatre is expression of as self-
referential. The representation of Vidigal as the cultural favela of Rio is a lie, says Julio
(app. C.8): “Vidigal is dead, empty, there is nothing. People want to sell a place that is vi-
brant in beauty and in culture, but there is nothing!”.
The type of newcomer exemplified by Hugo and Ida constructs Vidigal as cultural
favela. This construction is no coincidence. It has to be understood as a power strategy
to mark their claim to live in Vidigal. If Vidigal is arts and creativity, sure they have the
right to be there and contribute with what they can. I connect this representation of Vi-
digal with the understanding of the authentic Vidigal that it implies in the following sec-
tion.

Picture 10: Street art in Vidigal/2

6.1.6 -  Vidigal's New Beginnings

Hugo and Ida articulate Vidigal's authenticity as what Zukin would call “new begin-
nings” (see section 3.6). Hugo talks about the changes in Vidigal as something full of po-

Hugo, app. C.6
Hugo is optimist about the future of Vidigal. Throughout the interview he mentions
that displacement could become a problem, but the overall feeling about these changes
is positive, as the atmosphere is special. Hugo and Ida have discussed how some hap-
penings would not have taken place, if they had not been there to arrange them. Hugo
has high consideration for what the two have achieved, and he does not seem to regard
the possibility that an event such as Mistura Tropical, with its middle-class imaginary
and target group, might simply not appeal to the lower-class residents, who are still the
majority in Vidigal. These events are created by a niche of artists, for a target group that
only minimally overlaps with the whole of the residents. Those newcomers that see Vi-
digal's charm in its new beginnings identify the coolness of the favela in what they are
arranging themselves. Vidigal becomes cool because its informality and difference from
the rest of the city leave open spaces for parties, art installations and happenings. The
present of Vidigal is so cool, Ida continues, because:

 More of an arty scene [is visiting the favela], which I think it's cool for Vidigal. I'm enjoying it you
know? There's parties and there is a nice crowd of people […]. But… there is positives and negatives
about all of it […] I'm still totally happy. It's still getting better and better for me.

favela that emerge from newcomers' accounts. Newcomers can be divided into two
groups: those who refer to Vidigal as an historical place of struggle and those who refer
to it as Rio's creative favela. This division is reflected in what kind of authenticity the
newcomers identify in Vidigal. What the two visions have in common is that they both
perceive the favela as a background scenery for their constructed representations, as
their involvement with the life of the poor and uninteresting residents is very limited or
non-existing. The two visions are equally commodified and sanitised, as they both ro-
manticise favela life without a real engagement with its less charming sides. Both rep-
resentations are newcomers' constructions, and we have seen how some old-timers criti-
cise these representations. Cresswell highlighted how “place does not have meanings
that are natural and obvious but ones that are created by some people with more power
than others to define what is and is not appropriate” (Cresswell, 1996 in Cresswell,
2004:27). The power struggles inherent in place-making come forth when analysing the
constructions of the favela and of its authenticity. As we have seen in section 3.6, Zukin
points out how authenticity becomes a normative tool of power, that defines what is
good and what is not in the gentrifying neighbourhood and that forces the old-timers
out of their comfort zone. Likewise, in the previous section I have outlined how the dif-
ferent representations of the favela highlight class distinctions, and construct a favela
that is accessible for some residents but not for others.
Among the newcomers, one informant does not fit any of the previous patterns. This
is Karl35, the Austrian owner of the hostel and party venue Alto Vidigal. Karl is very dir-
ect in the description of the interactions within Vidigal, something that likely comes
from owning and running a business in the favela. Talking about Vidigal, he focuses on
what could be considered the opposite of a sense of community: neighbours or employ-
ees trying to cheat him, supposed friends turning their backs on him as soon as the con-

flict with another foreigner investor started (see note 37 on p.91), and in general feel-
ings of envy and jealousy. At the same time, the language Karl uses to describe favela
residents carries often a negative tone. Talking about the parties in Alto Vidigal, he tells
how, after the introduction of an entrance fee, some of the neighbours kept coming,
while the “vagabundos [tramps]” stopped. When he is asked about who comes to parties
nowadays, he answers that people with good music taste does, while the “vagabundos”,
those “who live in the streets”, do not. Finally, while discussing the consequences of
rising housing prices in Vidigal, he talks about those residents that are not happy about
the situation: “[they] don't have a house, […] don't have a job, they do drugs, […] they
don't have a chance to survive any more. And they will tell you […] 'It's because of you
gringos!'. So it's like you destroy his life because [you are here], wait, but what's his life?”
(app. C.9). What emerges by listening to Karl is a picture of his life in Vidigal that seems
more honest to reality than the romanticised picture that many of the other informants
present. As mentioned on page 71, Joaño and Reneé recognise the presence of good as well
as bad people among the favela resident. But listening to Timo, Ida or Hugo, one might
get a picture of Vidigal as exclusively inhabited by poor but honest and good residents.
This romantic vision of the favela, as we have already seen in Timo, is connoted by class
distinctions.
Karl's statements, that during the interview I found on the verge of being racist, pic-
ture with crude honesty a reality that is different from the other informants' words, but
that is not far from their practices. If Karl does not want the “vagabundos” to come to his
parties, Ida and Hugo's target group with the Mistura  Tropical event does not involve
this kind of resident either. In fact the type of participant at the parties in Alto Vidigal
did not differ much from those that participated in Mistura Tropical. Karl, due to his
business in the favela, has learned the hard way that favela life is not always as romantic
as other would believe it is.
Apart from being interesting in themselves, and from helping us in understanding
what it is that attracts and keeps newcomers in Vidigal, these ways of constructing
meaning are a good starting point to analyse which positions the representation of the

80

favela as an authentic place offer to both newcomers and old-timers.

Chasing the Real: Place Construction and Authenticity

6.2 -  Different Types of Gentrifiers

Most of the newcomers are attracted by the feeling of the authentic place, and con-
struct meaning about the favela in different ways, as we have seen above. These con-
structions of meaning both open up for and bring newcomers to assume different posi-
tions.
In her book A neighborhood that never changes (2009) Brown-Saracino undertakes a
comparative study of gentrification in urban as well as rural areas. The author's main
goal is to highlight how gentrification studies have focused on the idea of the gentrifier
as a pioneer, and have neglected other positions that gentrifiers can assume. Brown-
Saracino outlines in her book three different positions that newcomers can assume: the
social preservationist, the social homesteader and the pioneer.
Their main characteristics are summarised in Table 1. Social preservationists are
presented as a type of newcomer that finds the neighbourhood or town they move to as
attractive because of the presence of old-timers and of what they feel as an 'authentic'
community (Brown-Saracino, 2009:8-9). The practice of social preservation is indeed
defined as the “culturally motivated choice […] to live in authentic social space, embod-
ied by the sustained presence of “original” residents” (Brown-Saracino, 2004:135). So-
cial preservationists engage in practices both in the public and in their private sphere
that attempt to preserve the sense of place that they define as characterising the neigh-
bourhood (ibid.:147).
The position of the social homesteader is presented as lying in between the social pre-
servationist and the pioneer. Social homesteaders do not have the same concern for pre-
serving the old-timers and their lifestyles, but are not aiming at taming the wilderness
of their new neighbourhood either. Brown-Saracino explains how “many social
homesteaders prioritize the preservation of the built or natural environment, which

81

Part II – The Analysis

they believe gentrification threatens, over longtime residents” (Brown-Saracino,
2009:10). Social homesteaders are identified as being consumers of the diversity of the
neighbourhood, rather than being genuinely concerned with the future of the old-timers
(ibid.:11).
Finally, pioneers are those gentrifiers that are most often portrayed by academic liter-
ature on gentrification. They move to a neighbourhood seeking financial gain, and wel-
come change that values their properties, without regard for the old-timer population
(ibid.:4-8).

The positions presented by Brown-Saracino are relevant in this thesis. Newcomers,

82

6.2.1 -  Pioneers and Social Homesteaders

attracted by the authentic Vidigal, assume different positions once they have moved to
the favela. Understanding these positions helps in understanding how the newcomers
construct meaning about the favela. Probably due to the gentrification of Vidigal being
in its initial phase, many newcomers appear to abide to the ideology of preservation.
However, when looking at the intersection between this ideology and the newcomers'
practices, several contradictions emerge. Analysing more in depth these contradictions
helps the understanding of gentrification in Vidigal. For this reason, in this section I
briefly refer to pioneers and social homesteaders and analyse more in depth the posi-
tion of social preservationists.
Among my informants, Karl is the only one that takes upon himself the role of pion-
eer. The Austrian newcomer talks about his arrival to Vidigal without the romantic aura
the emerges through the other informants' stories and he recalls that he moved to Vidig-
al only because of the view and the possibility of a good investment.
More common among my informants seems to be the position of social homesteaders.
As we have seen, Hugo and Ida's view of Vidigal's authenticity is that of new beginnings.
The arrival of these alternative urban types is key in generating a special atmosphere,
together with the attention from the media, art and fashion world that follow their ar-
rival. In fact, at the end of our interview, Hugo shows me on his iPad a series of music
videos and commercials that have recently been shot in Vidigal, and looks at them from
over my shoulder with pride (field notes, January 8th, 2013). The fact that “young profes-
sionals” and “artists” are moving in, together with the fact that many Brazilians are com-
ing to Vidigal to party, is a drastic change from the comments Ida received when she ar-
rived in Rio in 2011. Ida (app. C.5) recalls her first day in Rio: “[in Ipanema] three
people in half an hour told me that I should come and live with them, because […] it was
too dangerous, I was going to get killed in Vidigal”. Both informants are very happy
about these changes, but during the interviews they still express a concern for Vidigal's
diversity and authenticity. Ida explains for instance that her blog Faces da Favela (2012)

83

Part II – The Analysis

6.2.2 -  Social Preservationists

and the tours that she arranged for tourists had as a goal that of showing the real Vidig-
al.The roles of social homesteader and social preservationist seem to overlap in my in-
formants. While during the interviews the different positions emerge more sharply, ob-
serving the informants' practices reveals similarities between the two groups. Those
that emerge as social preservationists in my interviews, for instance, have a very similar
social life to the homesteaders. Nonetheless, I present and analyse the position of the so-
cial preservationists, as this is probably the position that carries most contradictions
when it concerns gentrification in Vidigal.
During our interview, Timo talks about the risks of gentrification in Vidigal, a process
he knows from Berlin, and he tells how he moved to Vidigal also out of interest for the
ongoing neighbourhood processes, with “the new middle-class moving into here and all
the gringos” (app. C.18). As he sees the process as problematic, he tells how he has been
thinking about putting his knowledge at work to help the community. His goal would be
that of preparing and educating people to some of these changes, as well as sensitise
residents about the consequences of selling their homes, as some of them might decide
not to sell, if they were aware of all the consequences. Interestingly, Timo talks about the
role he and other foreigners could have, as in opposition to Brazilian newcomers:
maybe does to the gringos that are more sensible about where they go to. Especially the one that
at Copacabana. So yeah, the gringos that come here, mostly have I think, are sensible to the fact
Timo, app. C.18
Paul assumes a similar position:

come to Vidigal and not the ones that book their three weeks of summer holidays in Rio de Janeiro

[Most Brazilians] know of course what happened here, but it doesn't mean as much to them as it

that they live together with a lot of people that aren't as privileged as them.

84

Chasing the Real: Place Construction and Authenticity

We foreigners I think don't want to change the favela so much, and people from the rich society
from Brazil, who are investing in the favela, they do want to change the favela. […] For us [foreign-
ers] it's exotic, it is part of what we like here. Because it's different from where we live. And that is a
big difference, […] I think that we can protect a bit Vidigal, […] if more foreigners would buy than
people from the Zona Sul.

Paul, app. C.12
Both Timo and Paul see Brazilian newcomers as a bigger threat to Vidigal than for-
eigners are. Brazilians are presented as investors, while foreigners as those that care
about the future of Vidigal. However, taken outside our interaction, this position seems
very contradictory. Timo and Paul are part of the causes of the current changes Vidigal is
undergoing, even if they see themselves as more thoughtful than other newcomers. Paul
has bought a house on top of the morro together with his friend Oscar, thereby contrib-
uting to the rise in real estate prices (see section 7.1.1). Timo, despite his thoughts
about gentrification and his desire of starting preservation projects, has mostly foreign
friends and has not yet managed to reach a positive interaction with the old-timers. At
the same time I meet him at a party in the lower part of Vidigal, where the entrance fee
is between R$ 25-50, a prohibitive price for lower-class residents (field notes, January
25th, 2013). At the same party I meet most of my newcomer informants: Ida, who lives in
party venue, Joaño, Paul, Reneé, Hugo and Lisa. Despite some of these informants' con-
cerns, their practices show a different aspect of their life in the favela and on their role
in the current changes. Timo's, Paul's and most of the other informants' everyday lives
and activities are traditionally middle-class, except for the lack of infrastructure in their
neighbourhood. Furthermore, the 'exoticism' Paul talks about seems to have a very colo-
nial aura to it. The Vidigal that is attractive is the one that demarcates its difference from
the rest or Rio and from the Western capitals that are well known to many of the new-
comers. But the charm of the favela, as I also discuss in section 7.2.3, is limited to a piece
of scenery for everyday practices and lifestyles that are middle-class, and that does not
represent a break with the life of the more alternative middle-class in the rest of the city.
The same Paul contradicts this vision of all foreigners as social preservationists, when
he reports a conflict with a French woman:

85

 

Part II – The Analysis

One month ago I met a lady, a French, this one I told you, she is making a restaurant. And she
started to say to me 'Oh, after three months here I started to have a depression, because it's so filthy,
and my neighbour puts music all the day, I can't stand it, I want her to stop and bla bla'. I couldn't
stand that. I just told her: 'Why the hell are you coming here?' […] I was straight with her: I don't
want to be like that, to do… come to a place because I like it the way it is and then make it change
because of the stuff I don't like. […], that's a trap and that is what happened in many places, and
that is what is dangerous for Vidigal. Because otherwise it is going to become like Ipanema, quickly.

Paul, app. C.12
Here Paul underlines how it is not acceptable that newcomers come to Vidigal
without respecting its authentic origins, and with a desire of changing what they dislike.
Allowing this to happen would lead to a homogenisation of Vidigal, although Paul does
not believe that this will happen.
Both Paul and Timo have arrived to Vidigal because they felt attracted by its authenti-
city, and they now want to preserve it. Their operation reflects what Wendy Shaw has
highlighted in her study of gentrification in post-colonial Sydney: “gentrification has be-
come a celebration of whiteness and in its selective appropriation of history, a form of
neo-colonialism that excludes competing legitimate voices in the history of many neigh-
bourhoods now experiencing sudden upward social trajectories” (Shaw, 2005 in Atkin-
son and Bridge, 2005:12). To claim to have understood Vidigal's authenticity becomes a
very political and normative operation, by which social preservationists exclude other
voices in defining what is good and what is bad for the favela. They have come to Vidigal
and want to close the door behind them: they see authenticity in Vidigal's origins, and
they lay claim to which behaviours are appropriate and which are not in the favela. This
highlights the inherent contradictions in Brown-Saracino's social preservationists.
Brown-Saracino's work, effective in highlighting different approaches to gentrification
on the side of the newcomers, points out how it would be “easy enough to point to social
preservationists' hypocrisy” (Brown-Saracino, 2009:20). Nonetheless, in her work the
social preservationists' practices seem to shine as inherently good and well-intended.
While Brown-Saracino (2004:136) acknowledges that these newcomers can be self-

86

reflexive about their role in gentrification, she has little or no recognition for the fact
that their preservation practices are part of the problem all the same. In Vidigal, social
preservationists and social homesteaders are probably the main cause of gentrification,
and not just a minority. Ironically, they are the newcomers that are taming the wilder-
ness, by constructing new representations of the favela and thereby attracting busi-
nesses and homesteaders perhaps less interested in preservation.
 My informant Julio (app. C.8) criticises those newcomers with an academic back-
ground that come from abroad and try to apply what they have learned in university to
Vidigal. Their attempts are doomed to fail, as newcomers are incapable of adapting their
solutions to the local situation and do not respect what Julio calls the “rhythm” of the
favela. More in general, the social preservationists' interest for the neighbourhood
emerges as somewhat egoistic, as they so much want to be in it that they are not willing
to relocate somewhere else. This, despite their presence spoils that very authenticity
they had come looking for.
 As we have seen on page 79, Cresswell discusses how place is relational, and meaning
about it is created through power struggles and assumes a normative connotation. So-
cial preservationists enter the favela as newcomers but partake in this power struggle
by defining who, among the other newcomers, has the right to be there, and who does
not. The authenticity this type of gentrifier claims is a construction, and it talks about a
sanitised, safer version of the urban village or of the gritty neighbourhoods that are be-
ing gentrified. A version ready for consumption. It's like Williamsburg without social
problems, says Zukin (2010:52; see section 3.6).
What positions, then, are made available for the old-timers? The representations of
the favela as an authentic place tend to assume that the old-timers will remain as such.
The romanticisation of poverty typical of the left-wing middle-class risks to relegate the
actual poor (Vidigal's lower-class) in a pit of poverty that feeds the imaginary of the au-
thentic favela. Perhaps surprisingly, more emancipational possibilities emerge with the

6.2.3 -  What Role for the Old-Timers?

Chasing the Real: Place Construction and Authenticity

87

Part II – The Analysis

focus on Vidigal new beginnings. As I outline in section 7.3.2, the focus on art and cre-
ativity creates a possibility for those old-timers that are wealthier in cultural capital, as
this is the type of resident the newcomers want to relate to. Nonetheless, only a very
limited number of old-time residents can assume this position and make use of the pos-
sibilities it offers. For the most, the only old-timers that will benefit from the representa-
tion of the favela as authentic will be those old-timers that already had a privileged posi-
tion within the favela.

6.3 -  Partial Conclusion

In this chapter I highlighted a series of important themes about newcomers' arrival to
Vidigal. I have begun by looking into what brings newcomers to the favela, identifying a
key theme in the desire of moving to an authentic neighbourhood. This authenticity is
constructed in opposition to what is perceived as the homogeneous neighbourhoods of
Rio and of big Western cities. However, when looking into how meaning is created, it is
possible to identify patterns that outline what form of authenticity is attractive to the
different informants. In particular, I identified the representation of the favela as a place
of struggle and that of Vidigal as a creative, dynamic neighbourhood. These different
constructions of meaning emerge more sharply when they are intersected with Zukin's
double conceptualisation of authenticity as origins and as new beginnings. Building on
Brown-Saracino's work, I pointed out the positions assumed by my informants, in par-
ticular that of social preservationist. Social preservationists, while attempting to pre-
serve Vidigal's authenticity, define which behaviours are welcome and which ones are
not. Furthermore, social preservationists fail, as much as other newcomers, in seeing
their responsibility in the gentrification of Vidigal.
The divisions concerning the different representations of Vidigal and of its authenti-
city are based in different understandings of the sense of place. Vidigal's social preserva-
tionists, together with those old-timers that oppose the current changes, react to the

88

Chasing the Real: Place Construction and Authenticity

challenges posed by globalisation with a reactionary construction of place that re-
sembles Harvey's conceptualisation. In particular the focus on the history of resistance
of Vidigal is an attempt to root the favela in history, to construct it in opposition to the
outside and to identify the old-timers' identity and the favela in a sort of unity. When so-
cial preservationists adopt this understanding of the sense of place, two interesting ele-
ments emerge. First, the fact that the category of the old-timer is in itself a complicated
construction (see Brown-Saracino, 2004:141-145 & 2009:145-179) undermines the
connection between place and their identity. This element does not emerge in the new-
comers' accounts, but does in some of the old-timers', as for instance Mario, who high-
lights several times throughout our interview the difference between Carioca [original
of Rio] population and immigrants from the north-east of Brazil. Second, social preser-
vationists construct place in this manner but allow themselves as the exception, closing
the door behind them after their arrival. On the other hand, those newcomers that
identify the authentic Vidigal in its new beginnings and that praise the cultural favela,
together with the cultural elite among the old-timers, construct place in a way that re-
minds of Massey's progressive understanding of the sense of place. In these residents'
understanding, place is not so much rooted in history, but it is a more fluid construction
that is shaped by the events that characterise Vidigal and by the people that interact
with it, whether they are middle-class residents or internationally known artists. Two
interesting considerations can be made. First, these understandings of the sense of place
cut through the division old-timer/newcomer, rather than running along this categorisa-
tion's lines. Second, as May had pointed out (see section 3.4.3), it emerges that several
understandings of the sense of place can coexist in the same place at the same time.

Sergio36, app. C.16
These quotes from two old-time residents of Vidigal give at first glance an idea of how
the old-timers' opinions about the arrival of newcomers can be different and even con-
trasting.
In the previous chapter I have investigated why newcomers come to Vidigal, how they
construct meaning about the favela, and how their different views on what the authentic
Vidigal is lead to different claims on the place. In this chapter I focus on how the arrival
of newcomers impacts Vidigal, the lives of the old-timers and their lifestyles. Thus, this
chapter focuses on the second part of the research question. To simplify the analysis, I
have selected three main themes that have emerged both through interviews and obser-
vations: housing and displacement; the party scene and everyday interaction. In the fol-
lowing, through an analysis of these themes, I uncover the ways in which social relations
in the favela are impacted by the arrival of newcomers.

Impact on the Social Relations

7.1 -  Housing and Displacement

On my arrival in the favela, the first thing that needed to be taken care of was to find a
stable place to live for the duration of my field work. I had found an online announce-
ment for Oscar and Paul's house on the top of the morro, but due to a new tenant moving
in, they could not offer me anything for more than the first week. On the second day of
my stay I got a couple of tips from Oscar and I began walking around the favela, entering
bars and shops, chatting with people and asking if, by any chance, they knew of a room
that I could rent. Many answered that these were difficult times to rent, compared to
how easy it had been some years before. I was told how the market cannot keep up with
the demand. This has made it difficult and more expensive to find a room to rent, both
for long and for short period of times (field notes).
That the housing market would be affected by the current changes was expectable, as
much of the theory on gentrification focuses on rising housing prices and on displace-
ment of previous residents as one of the major problems in gentrifying neighbourhoods.
However, the issue was more present in the everyday life that I had expected. Comments
on rising prices and on the saturation of the market emerged, in the following weeks, in
dozens of more or less deep chats with informants, friends and people I had just met,
without me introducing the subject. The issue, it showed, regarded both houses for sale
and for rent (field notes).
Several of the informants refer back to one specific case as the beginning of real estate
speculation in Vidigal: the arrival of Rolf Glaser, a German investor that came to Vidigal
in 2008. Glaser planned on attracting German tourists to Vidigal, as the view was aston-
ishing and the location optimal for tourism. Rio Times Online (2010) reports the in-
vestor's attempt to “kick start the local housing market with an ambitious redevelop-
ment project”. However, due to bureaucratic impediments, Glaser abandoned his project
and sold his properties37. My informant Mario recalls how the arrival of the German in-
37 One of these properties was sold to my informant Karl, and it is now the hostel and party
venue Alto Vidigal. A conflict between Glaser and Karl exploded a few months later, receiving
much attention from the media. See The Washington Post, 2013 and The Guardian, 2013.

91

Part II – The Analysis

vestor caused a sudden boom in housing market: “normally people get through negoti-
ations [when they sell houses] […]. [Glaser] started buying stuff, and starting from this
moment, people started charging more” (app. C.11). Glaser's investment plan failed, but
he was not the only investor with plans for Vidigal. At the time of my field-work, a
5-star-hotel was being built on the top of the favela (see Picture 11), as a joint invest-
ment between Brazilians Helio Pellergrino, architect, and Antonio Rodrigues, wealthy
entrepreneur and owner of the well-established bar-chain Belmonte (O Globo, 2012a).

Vidigal.

7.1.1 -  A 'One-House-at-a-Time' Gentrification

Despite these big investment plans, the type of gentrification taking place in Vidigal
appears to be led by individual buyers (and renters). With Glaser's important exception,
most newcomers (including all my informants) seem to be moving to Vidigal to live
there, rather than to speculate on the booming market by buying to sell again. Some, like

92

Impact on the Social Relations

Karl, combine living with business, but on a different scale than the big investors who
buy in Vidigal to speculate without living there. In accordance to Clark (1992), I do not
share Warde's (1991:224 in Hamnett, 1992:117-118) and Hamnett's (1992) argument
that Smith's rent-gap is not a valuable explanation to gentrification when facing this
'one-house-at-a-time' type of gentrification. However, I do agree with Warde that this
scale is different from big capital accumulation projects. It is probably for this difference
in scale that many old-timers are very critical of Glaser's project, while the approach to
the one-by-one gentrification seems more nuanced. Studies estimate that the arrival of
the UPP in Rio's favelas has caused an increase in housing prices of up to 50% in the
first three days after pacification (see The Washington Post, 2013). In neighbourhoods
around the pacified favelas the UPP is estimated to be the cause of a 15% rise in real es-
tate value (Estadaño, 2012). According to some of my informants, the arrival of the UPP
and of a new type of resident have caused prices to rise of at least 400% in the last four
years (Renato, see also Hugo and Lisa). For this reason, some informants talk about the
new real estate values as an opportunity for old-timers, who, when they own a property,
never would have thought of having the chance to sell for the current prices. Old-timer
Sergio (app. C.16) tells about a friend of his who sold to a foreigner: “he went back to his
birthplace, Fortaleza. A gringo offered a considerable amount that was enough to sus-
tain himself back in his city and he sold”. Mario mentioned how selling now can give
people a chance to move to a cheaper location, either in the north-east of Brazil or in the
north of Rio, and still have money left to “buy a taxi and sustain the family there” (field
notes, January 2nd, 2013). Paul reports the locals' reaction when him and his friend
Oscar offered R$ 70.000 for a house that the neighbours meant was worth R$
30-40.000: 
When we came [we saw] the dollars in their eyes, because we were gringos obviously, and they
the price go ppssstt go higher you know? […] also one neighbour started to offer a house nearby, for
Paul, app. C.12

wouldn't have imagined that they could sell the house so expensive. So in a way we have been fair
and it is good, because we did not [steal] the house, we really paid it, but on the other way we made

a ridiculous price.

93

Part II – The Analysis

For some of the old-timers the new prices are an opportunity, but others might be
pushed into selling as a necessity. Mario mentions how people might sell as in the favela,
“when there is money there is no resistance, because the needs of people here are very
big” (app. C.11). Rita points directly to the rising cost of life as something that could
force people to sell:

[…]  people have to pay light, pay this and that.  People with a minimum wage can pay these
things? No they can't pay water, light, gas, internet, cable, they can't. People will be suffocated. If
you can't pay and if you own a house that is worth 50.000 and I tell you 'I give you 100.000', you are
going to sell it. You are going to leave: minus 1! I make a damn huge house. On the other side [of the

road] 'Ah you sold to him? My house is worth 100' and they give him 200. Pssstt [mimes with the
Rita, app. C.15
Dora's38 story is not dissimilar: despite her positive attitude, she had to come to terms
with the fact that Vidigal had become too expensive. Dora was forced to sell her apart-
ment, as the bills had become too expensive. When she looked for a house in Vidigal,
with a small garden where her daughter could play, she did not find anything that she
could afford. Dora ended up buying a house in Freguesia, in the West Zone of Rio. While
she tells the story with a positive attitude, she also tells that it was hard a very hard de-
cision.The rent market does not seem to be different, as newcomers with more economic
possibilities come to Vidigal pushing up the prices. Danilo's account exemplifies very
well how the problems takes form in the favela:

Here this lady that lives… used to live in that house for 30 or so years […]. A foreigner comes look-
ing for a place to live, he asked someone that by coincidence was the owner of that house: 'I'm look-
ing for a place to rent. By myself, I pay R$ 1.500'. The woman that had lived there for 40 years paid
R$ 350 and she would always pay on time. The owner kicked her out to put the foreigner, because

Morro. She is an actress and a single mother.94

Impact on the Social Relations

he would pay 1.500. […] And where did the lady go? I don't know…

Danilo, app. C.3
In section 3.5.1 we have seen that already since its first appearance in 1964 the term
gentrification carried with itself a notion of the inevitability of the displacement of the
old-time residents of the gentrifying neighbourhood. Displacement is identified by
Brown-Saracino (2010a:2) as “the most direct negative consequence” of gentrification,
and it is often highlighted by researchers in their studies on gentrification (see, among
many others, Lund Hansen et al., 2001 and Zukin, 1987). Vidigal seems to be no excep-
tion: a new, wealthier type of resident arrives, demand grows, prices soar and some of
the old-timers are displaced.
This situation led to open conflict in 2012, when an old-timer that had a room to rent
put up an ad saying 'Room for rent only for foreigners'. This caused indignation among
other old-timers (Dora and Danilo). Julio, who is explicitly against the presence of for-
eigners in Vidigal, explains how the presence of wealthier newcomers can compromise
the delicate housing market in the favela. He uses as example a German friend of his:

A German friend […] said '[…] When I got to Rio several people told me 'I live in a favela and it's
cool', but I think our presence is very bad for you, so I prefer to pay. My university gave me some
money and I will use this money in a place that I can afford outside the favela. Why? Because if I
come and pay less I will have money left from the university, but in return you will pay more than
what you pay. I will stay here 2-3-6 months and [what about] you, that will stay here?'.

Julio, app. C.8
What emerges through the stories that the informants have reported is a complicated
and diversified picture. While everyone agrees that there has been a rampant specula-
tion on the real estate market in the recent years, reactions are different according to
the interlocutor. Some of the informants mention how the price rise has been welcomed
by a part of those old-timers who are house-owners. Some of the residents that moved

95

to Vidigal from the north-east of Brazil in the previous decades have seen their prop-
erty's increased value as an opportunity to go back to where they came from, as in the
case of Sergio's friends. Likewise, my informant Armando, despite his strong engage-
ment with the community, says he is in no rush, but that when prices will rise in his
area, close to Largo do Santinho, he will sell for a good price and move to the suburbs of
Rio. As Lisa puts it: “if you are moving back to the north of Brazil, I don't blame people
for taking the opportunity to make their buck, this is the time to do it” (app. C.10). In
this kind of situation, although it is understandable that other old-timers (for instance
Rita or Mario; but also social preservationists like Timo) would rather have people not
to sell as they fear the consequences that this might bring, it is difficult to blame those
that take this decision. However, not all stories have a happy-ending like in the case of
Sergio's friend. Danilo recalls the story of the woman who sold Glaser the property that
would later be sold to Karl. The woman asked Danilo for advice, as Glaser was offering
R$ 30.000 and she was tempted to sell. Danilo claims he advised her not to sell for less
than R$ 500.000, as it was the view that Glaser was interested in, not her small, old
house. Nonetheless, the woman sold for R$ 30.000 and bought a small house closer to
the bottom of the favela. Now, only a few years later, she regrets the sale, as she has fin-
ished the money and no longer has the view she had.
Despite the emergence of this type of story, the rent-gap (see section 3.5.2) is still
high, especially comparing Vidigal's prices to the prices of neighbouring areas of the city.
The website Urbanizo provides a tool to measure the average value per square meter of
real estate in a neighbourhood39. According to the website database, the average price in
39 It appears that Urbanizo only provides information about authorised housing, without con-
sidering informal housing, such as self-built houses on squatted land, that have not received
land titles. While this considerably affects that average prices of an area such as Vidigal, as it
considers only its most expensive properties, these numbers can provide the reader with a
general idea of the difference in real estate value between Vidigal and the neighbouring
areas.

May 2013 is R$ 6.653/m²40 in Vidigal. In the neighbouring Saño Conrado it is R$
9.360/m², and R$ 12.499/m² in Gaévea. But it is in contrast to Leblon, the closest neigh-
bouring area, also on the seafront, that the difference becomes breathtaking, with an av-
erage price per square meter of R$ 22.578 (Urbanizo, 2013). As a consequence, Mario
(app. C.11) talks about the changing profile of the favela resident. He explains: “When I
say it changed the profile, it's people that earned down there, like a family that has an
income of R$ 7.000, but a family with R$ 7.000 can't live in Leblon, it's too expensive. […]
Their vision is that 'OK the violence is gone on the morro, I go and live up there'”. The
combination of cheap real estate that attracts a family from Leblon with the authenticity
that attracts many of the newcomers pushes the demand and prices grow. This is caus-
ing, to use Mario's words, a change in the profile of the favela dweller.
This profile change is itself subject to very different reactions among the residents, as
we can see in the quotes that opened this chapter (see p.91). While Sergio is happy
about the arrival of the gringos, Mario talks about contamination. Dora (app. C.4) jokes
about an “invasion” and Rita argues that newcomers “suffocate” the old-timers, who can-
not refuse to sell when faced by the offers made for their houses (app. C.15). In general,
old-timers share the view that the rising real estate values will contribute to change Vi-
digal's social composition. Mario (app. C.11) calls the process gentrification, using the
Brazilian expression of “remoção branca” [literally 'white removal', also used as transla-
tion for 'gentrification'], while Renato (app. C.13) talks about a “silent removal. A disap-
propriation of the place from the people of this place” that risks to turn Vidigal into the
Berverly Hills of favelas. Rita and Mario foresee that in thirty years Vidigal will be unre-
cognisable, while already in ten years people will look at what is left of today's Vidigal as
if it was history. Rita, Renato and Danilo show resentment for these developments. Rita
(app. C.15) is angry with the “dumb” old-timers, as they sell without thinking about the
community or their own future. In Renato and Danilo's words, instead, a kind of sadness
shows through. Danilo says that he is not against newcomers wanting to experience
what the favela is. “I would like to know […] Harlem”, he admits (app. C.3). However, he
continues, things are going too far, if old-timers no longer have a place in Vidigal. Be-

cause of all the difficulties they had to face through their lives, old-timers would deserve
to live in an improved Vidigal, instead of being displaced by newcomers.
Despite a different approach, a similar prediction is made by Sergio. Sergio's guess,
based on the ongoing changes, is that “in 2020 or 2030 […] it can be that the people liv-
ing here will only be the people with money, and that the poor will come here only to
work for them” (app. C.16). Despite these grim previsions, Sergio mirrors a trend that I
have often encountered during informal conversations (field notes). Sergio is among
those old-timers that do not perceive newcomers as culprits. He is genuinely fascinated
by the current changes in the place where he has grown up, and he is excited by the pos-
sibility of meeting foreigners. This shows also during our interview: by the end our roles
are swapped and Sergio begins to interview my translator Daniel. What appears as a di-
chotomy in Sergio's answers, is in reality a way to deal with the questions I am asking
him. After talking about his everyday life, about the housing market and about his inter-
actions with newcomers, I ask him if he thinks this process will change Vidigal. Faced by
a question that forces him to give an answer less grounded than the others in his every-
day experience, Sergio positions himself as a responsible resident who has understood
the process and knows what it will lead to. Furthermore, both in the case of Sergio and
in a few occasions during informal conversations, my counterparts might have preferred
to talk nicely about newcomers when speaking to me, whom they might have perceived
as a newcomer.
When discussing housing and displacement with my newcomer informants, they all
acknowledged that the ongoing process will change Vidigal, but, as we had also seen in
chapter 6, they fail in taking responsibility for these changes.
To conclude this section it is interesting to note how Hugo and Lisa refer to an inter-
esting phenomenon. Asked to report stories of displacement, Hugo tells about a French
girl whose rent has doubled from one day to the other. Likewise, Lisa talks about for-
eigners that had to relocate as a consequence of raising prices. In her paper on super-
gentrification, Lees (2003) highlights how first-wave gentrifiers can be forced to move
when the effects of gentrification intensify. This was also pointed out by Zukin
(2010:58; see also 2008:732), that reported how the first wave of hipsters and artists

who gentrified Williamsburg is slowly relocating towards Queens, where rent is cheaper.
In this section I analysed the impact of gentrification on the housing market. Displace-
ment is already a reality in Vidigal, with prices quickly becoming unaffordable for many
old-time residents (and some newcomers) due to the sudden increase in real estate de-
mand. While for some old-timers this is perceived as a possibility to sell and live a more
comfortable life in other areas of Rio or of Brazil, for others it means a disruption of so-
cial networks and worsened life conditions. Except for a limited number of examples,
pressure on the housing market seems to come from individual in-movers rather than
big investors. Finally, I have highlighted how old-timers react differently to the impact of
gentrification on the housing market.
In the following section, I investigate the impact of the arrival of newcomers on an-
other aspect of favela life: parties.

7.2 -  The Party Scene

At my arrival in the favela I discovered a nightlife that could be said to match that of
the coolest European music capitals. Parties have different names, such as the Morro
Eletrônico [electronic favela], the Lamparina [torch] and the Sopa [soup]. Themes vary
as well, but rhythms are prevalently electronic, and the crowds participating are a mix of
newcomers and middle-class residents of the rest of Rio. I am told that in certain occa-
sions, like at the Sopa parties, one can well expect to meet emerging music stars or act-
ors from the latest soap operas (field notes). Similarly, one might well expect not to meet
more than a handful of old-timers, as entrance fees vary between R$ 20-50 and as bar
prices are twice as high as in other bars in Vidigal. Old-timer Bruno, talking about this
kind of party, tells me that these events have another target group than favelados like

99

7.2.1 -  A “Cultural Shock”

him. Bruno claims that even if he wore nice clothes for the occasion and had money to
pay the entrance fee, he would not be allowed in the party. During my field-work I have
not witnessed the kind of open discrimination Bruno talks about, but it is probably of
little importance whether this account is true or not. What is relevant is what Bruno and
other old-timers think is true, and why they do so. In fact, Bruno's story has to be ana-
lysed in relation to the power struggle between newcomers and old-timers that gentri-
fication has brought about. Vidigal is a contested place, and the ongoing power struggle
to define which representation of the favela has right to claim the place emerge through
the perception of Vidigal's party scene that Bruno reports. In this section I investigate
what impact the arrival of newcomers has had on the parties in Vidigal.
Old-timers such as Julio and Renato consider the disappearance of free parties as one
of the most visible consequences of the arrival of the UPP. Renato (app. C.13) does not
hesitate in answering “parties” when I ask him what has changed since pacification, and
calls the changes a “cultural shock”. The arrival of the UPP has meant a halt to the funk
parties that used to take place in the streets of Vidigal every Friday, and that police per-
ceived as too tightly connected to the drug traffickers' culture (Vidiga!, 2011 and Mario).
Baile funk parties at the Largo do Santinho were considered the main night gathering of
the favela. After the arrival of the UPP this role has been taken up by the hostel Alto Vi-
digal, owned by Austrian Karl (O Globo, 2012b). Renato reports that it is no longer al-
lowed to hold parties in the streets, something that was normal before the UPP. At the
same time, private parties have to comply with safety and other regulations, and there
have been incidents of parties that have been stopped because of this. Some of the old
customs, Renato argues, might have been wrong, but the UPP is exaggerating in imple-
menting these rules, as this is the way Vidigal has functioned for decades. This cultural
shock is perceived as a normative conflict that aims at disciplining the lives of favela res-
idents: “you don't need authorization from the police to continue your life”, claims Ren-
ato (app. C.13). Renato's critiques are moved to the UPP, which is identified as an extern-

al force imposing new norms on the residents' ways of living. Changes in the party scene
had already started before pacification, but pacification, by imposing these new rules,
eliminated the alternatives to the more expensive parties that had appeared in the
favela. My informant Rosa affirmed several times during our conversations that the real
pacification of the favela was made by Karl from Alto Vidigal. By bringing the people
from the asfalto [literally 'asphalt', term used in the favela to denote the more urbanised
areas of the South Zone outside of Vidigal] to his parties, Rosa argues, Karl closed the
gap between favela and the rest of the city (field notes, January 10th, 2013). These
parties attracted young people from all over Rio, and showed that the favela was not as
dangerous as the media would have it. Rosa is glad to acknowledge the role Alto Vidigal
had, in contrast to the negative words she has for the 'official' pacification. However, the
positive role attributed to Alto Vidigal's parties is not shared by the entirety of the
favela's residents. Reneé reports how these parties have been considered controversial
since their beginning. Karl would participate to the free funk parties the drug traffickers
organised every Friday night, but on Saturdays, when parties would be hosted in Alto Vi-
digal, he would not let traffickers in, unless they paid the entrance fee. Reneé reports that
this triggered unsatisfied comments among the traffickers, who were not happy about
Karl's decisions. However, Reneé continues, old-time residents got accustomed to it, and
would now openly say that those parties are not for them. My old-time informants
would agree with Reneé. 
Apart from Bruno, whose opinion we have seen in the introduction to this section,
Aldo and Julio claim that the average old-timer is not welcome to these parties. When I
ask Aldo about old-timers' reactions to these events, he answers:

7.2.2 -  A Closed Party?

It's like you took my rooftop to make a barbecue, and I couldn't come in. […] I was in a party in
Santa Marta [another of Rio's gentrifying favelas] that costed R$ 200. I went to this party, I didn't
pay because I am an artist and I was invited, but there was no one from the favela, maybe 3-4. In-

side a quadra de samba, and it's absurd. The quadra was made for people to enjoy on Saturday. […]

101

This is not cool. It's exclusion, it bothers me.

Aldo, app. C.1
Likewise, Julio tells that he has tried to attend one of these parties, which had a fa-
voured fee for residents, but he did not see other old-timers participating.
Karl marks with pride the differences between the parties he arranges and those ar-
ranged by other newcomers, such as Morro Eletrônico, arranged, among others, by my
German informant Till41. Karl arranges dub parties while Till plays techno. The first one
sets the entrance fee to R$ 30 compared to the R$ 40 of the second one. But for the old-
timers there is no difference. Both parties play new music rhythms, are too expensive
and are not welcoming for them. Their form of communication also appeals to an inter-
national or anyway globalised crowd. The flyer of the Morro Eletrônico party I had the
opportunity to attend promotes the event highlighting the city of origin of the DJ's who
would play: two are from Berlin, one from Los Angeles and two from Rio. The crowd is a
combination of Vidigal's newcomers, Rio's foreign residents, tourists and middle-class
Brazilians. It is true that the party goers of Alto Vidigal are more alternative than the
participants of the Morro Eletrônico (field notes). But as much as old-timers call gringo
all the foreigners regardless of their actual nationality, they are not going to see any dif-
ference between newcomers regardless of the brand of their shoes. The combination of
these elements discourages the old-timers to the extent that Bruno, as we have seen in
the introduction, claims that they would not allow him in, even if he had the right cloth-
ing and the money. Here, Zukin's remark is well fitting: “the tastes behind these new
spaces of consumption are powerful because they move longtime residents outside their
comfort zone, gradually shifting the places that support their way of life to life supports
for a different cultural community” (2010:4). An important shift is introduced here: the
lower-class old-timers are marginalised as if they were a minority. This, despite the fact
that they still constitutes the numeric majority of Vidigal's population. Zukin (2010:43)
highlights how, in the early phase of Williamsburg's gentrification, artists were only the

design company Vidigalo, but is soon going to start to work for a bigger advertisement com-
pany in Rio.

2% of the local population. Nonetheless, they were very visible. In the process of gentri-
fication, the power relations are altered by the arrival of a new type of resident. In the
previous sections we have seen how newcomers have access to the best real estate in
the favela, among them the houses with a view. In this section we have seen how new-
comers dominate the nightlife of Vidigal, to the extent that old-timers feel excluded and
unwelcome, and do not want to go anywhere near the electronic parties that populate
Vidigal's nights. The old-timers, despite their numerical majority, become a minority in
terms of the distribution of power. This is a drastic change from the situation previous
to the gentrification of the favela. Julio points to the fact that Vidigal is home to tens of
thousands of residents, while, with a self-organised census, he has counted only “220”
foreigners living in Vidigal. Even if we add the Brazilian newcomers, that Julio has not
considered, it becomes immediately clear that the newcomers are a very small numeric
minority of Vidigal's residents. Nonetheless, they emerge as a majority if we look at
their power in the construction of the favela as place and in the definition of good and
bad practices in Vidigal. The problem is well exemplified by Julio's words: “[The foreign-
ers' impact is] huge. It's like… I am 1.85m high, but a virus is microscopic. The virus of
the flu is microscopic, still it can kill me. Imagine, for as small as it is, it's very violent”
(app. C.8). Similarly, the newcomers are only a small minority, but their impact on the
favela and its residents is tremendous.
 Asked about the first period of parties in Alto Vidigal, Karl (app. C.9) tells that the
venue began by charging around R$ 10-15, but that prices have grown since. Karl is very
proud of the quality of the music Alto Vidigal offers, and argues that it was to maintain
these standards that prices had to rise to R$ 20-30 per night. He tells that it would not
be possible to charge more, as otherwise the alternative scene of Rio – Alto Vidigal's tar-
get group – could not afford to come. Till talks of the entrance at his party in comparison
to Rio's clubbing scene, claiming that at Morro Eletrônico you get more value for money.
Both newcomers consider the entrance fees of their parties as fair, as long they are ac-
cessible for their target group. However, the average favela resident, who cannot afford
the venue's prices – both entrance and bar prices - is not considered. The old-timers are
not the target group, as the two explicitly say during my interviews.

103

Asked about interaction between different type of favela residents at his parties, Karl
(ibid.) answers that at “[the party] you wouldn't have the feeling [that people keep to
their separate corners]. […] If somebody [told] me that I would be surprised”, he contin-
ues. From what I could see at the parties I had the chance to participate to during my
field-work, it is no surprise that Karl means that no one stands in the corner without in-
teracting with the other party-goers. The old-timers are simply not present. Participants
are socially homogeneous, and the only difference among them is whether they live in
Vidigal or not. They are all having a great time, and they have no problem in interacting
with each other. The party-goers at Alto Vidigal, when the first light of the day begins to
emerge from the horizon, point their smart phones and cameras at the view and take
the pictures that will consecrate the night. They have been partying in the favela, and
now they can post it on Facebook.
Till explains that he collaborates with the Erasmus program, so that international stu-
dents are informed about his and his friends' parties. These students “want to go to
favela parties […] but the gringos are usually a bit lost in funk parties” (app. C.17). The
compromise, then, is that of going to a party in a favela that has nothing to do with the
favela. Till's target group is fascinated by the favela, but as soon as the initial fascination
disappears, newcomers feel out-of-place at funk parties with actual favela residents. As
we have seen on page 70 for what concerns the choice of which favela to move to, this
group of party goers prefers the commodified version of the favela that a party arranged
by other newcomers offers. The favela is fascinating but feared, and 'honest interaction'
with its old-time residents is avoided. Vidigal becomes no more than the background for
a group photograph taken on the dance-floor. This is something we have seen also in the
case of the event Mistura Tropical, that used the favela simply as scenery. Recalling the
purchase of the house, Karl (app. C.9) tells: “I never saw a picture before of this view.
Now everybody knows the picture already. Like on Facebook”. No one knew it at the
time, and now, three and half years later, it is still the only reason why people come to

party here. Bruno (app. C.2) says with disappointment that these party goers, especially
those that do not live in the favela, “come here and pay R$ 40 […] for weed, cocaine.
[They do not come] to dance and enjoy it and hug me”. Julio is equally disturbed by this
use of the favela as background for middle-class parties, and argues that it is wrong that
the party organisers exploit the imaginary of the favela without providing any benefit to
it. Ida (app. C.5) points out how it is foreigners who are “able to aim [the money] to-
wards the tourist population”. Reneé (app. C.14) agrees: “I am kind of sorry [because] all
this profit it should go to the hands of people that were born here and got through many
difficulties”. Nonetheless newcomers are not the only ones making money: artists from
Vidigal connected to the theatre are also in the party business, and are equally success-
ful in their endeavours as the newcomers, as the Sopa parties that some of them arrange
testify (Boa Diversaño, 2012). Due to their economic and social capital, these residents
are able to profit from the party scene, as they know how to organise and brand parties
that will attract their middle-class target groups. While Julio does not say it explicitly, we
can see a clear class dynamic emerging when looking at who arranges these parties.
Middle-class residents, whether they are newcomers or old-timers, are behind the new
type of party in Vidigal. Due to their economic, social and cultural capital, these resid-
ents have monopolised the party scene to the extent that residents like Bruno feel ex-
cluded from it.
Renato argues that before the favela turned fashionable, visitors came to Vidigal to in-
teract with its residents. However, things have changed:

A party on the roof in Rua 3, there is a van down at the bus stop waiting for people coming for
the party. People arrive down there, get in the van, get to the party, they stay on the roof, look at the
view and the sea, it's all beautiful and they post it on Facebook. When the party is over, they get in
the van and they are left in the [Avenida] Niemayer. They are in a bubble. There is no interaction,
because to these parties does people go? The community doesn't participate, because it's expensive.
But these people come to try different sensations. A party on a rooftop in a favela! I think it's annoy-
ing when people get here, foreigners or not they come here and stay in their bubble on the roof, and
then they talk about 'Wow there was a party there in the favela… so cool' I don't know what. But
they don't know what it is.

Renato, app. C.13

105

Part II – The Analysis

Danilo criticises this relation to the favela, when he tells that he wants to leave Vidigal
also because the favela has become fashion, while some old-timers are still poor people
in need.
Newcomers that live in Vidigal are often critical of the party situation, especially those
that assume the position of social preservationists. Lisa (app. C.10), shares Renato's
view: “Digital Dubs, […] Morro Electrico [sic], I don't think they are in the right place, I
think it's exploitive. […] [M]aybe some people from here [can afford it], but it's very rare.
It's busloads of kids from Leblon and Ipanema, so that they can say they went to the
favela”. Joaño is no less critical of the party goers who participate in these events:
It's like in Rocinha they have this baile funk called The favoritos, everybody 'Yeah, let's go to
baile in the favela!'. You get there and to get in it's R$ 120. Who the fuck from the favela is going to
be there? So it's all for these playboys and these patrocinhos [upper class kids] to go and 'Yeah I
was partying at the baile in the favela, you know? I'm bad ass', bunch of fucking losers you know?
Joaño, app. C.7
Despite their criticism, both informants, as we have also seen on page 85, participate
to some of these same parties. Joaño says that those that come for a party but that do not
live in Vidigal are “losers”, in opposition to those, like him, who have gone all the way,
and have moved to the favela. The position Joaño and other newcomers assume while
talking with me during the interview is that of responsible residents worried for the fu-
ture of the community. However, through their practices, they become part of the very
problem they criticise. It is interesting to note how the newcomers that live in Vidigal –
Joaño in more vivid terms than others – assume a position of moral superiority towards
the party-goers that come to Vidigal on a weekend night. By assuming this position they
imply a form of ownership over Vidigal, a claim that, as we have seen (section 6.1), has
its roots in these newcomers' representations of the true and authentic favela. This
claim is normative, as it outlines which practices are good and therefore acceptable and
which ones are not. Living in the favela is good and humble. Coming to the favela for a
party is for losers. Paradoxically, if we think about Julio's statements when talking about

106

Impact on the Social Relations

7.2.4 -  The Thrill of a Vibrant Nightlife

housing (see p.95), the good and bad practices are inverted, as the newcomers moving
to the favela have a deeper and more long lasting impact on the community than those
who come for a party.
Mirroring the same divisions that emerged when discussing the creation of meaning
about Vidigal by newcomers, Ida and Hugo have a different approach to this kind of
party than social preservationists like Joaño. Besides being involved themselves in arran-
ging some of these events (e.g. Mistura Tropical), both informants are thrilled by the fact
that the place they live in is a vibrant nightlife destination. We have seen how Ida ac-
knowledges that this has both positive and negative aspects to it, but that things are just
getting better for her (see p.78). The contact with the party scene amuses her the most:
“the people passing by my
house… it's ridiculous […].
Sometimes […] I look around
and  I  think  'You are all
artists'! Like that's so cool”
(app.
 C.5). Talking about
parties and arts more in gen-
eral, Ida talks as if she was in
an advertisement for Vidigal
that had to create an atmo-
sphere of expectation for all that is about to happen in the near future: “I am enjoying it,
it's good if you are young, there is […] parties and art and great things. Let's just see
what happens… Watch this space! [laughs]”.
Likewise, Hugo recommends me some of these parties:
There is another party called Lamparina […]. It's once a month and most of the people that go

Picture  12:   Art   made   or   recycled   materials,   outside   Ida's

there are mostly from Ipanema. […] [It's] actors and producers who do this once a month party and

107

Part II – The Analysis

party to go. People from the community organize this but most of the people who go there they are
people from Leblon.

Hugo, app. C.6
A few weeks later I join the Lamparina party. Old-timers are working at the entrance
or at the bar, but I only see newcomers and middle-class hipsters from the asfalto at-
tending it. The line outside the venue is more than 50m long, and attendees are dropped
off by taxis in front of the entrance. As the entrance fee changes according to the time,
party goers begin complaining about the slow queue when the clock marks midnight,
because they are asked to pay R$ 40 instead of R$ 30. While I am waiting outside the
party venue, the amount of cars and taxis coming to the party or stopping for a drop-off
in front of the entrance has paralysed the traffic on the narrow Avenida Joaño Goulart. A
few moto-taxi drivers working the night shift find themselves by chance next to each
other and at the side of the line of party-goers. They cannot move forward because of
the traffic, and begin to stare at people in line with an annoyed look. After a couple of
minutes of standing still, they begin giving gas to their motorbikes while in neutral gear,
making their engines roar in unison through the night. This, that by most of the people
in line around me is perceived as a meaningless provocation, is in reality a very auditive
expression of the gap that divides the majority of old-time residents and the parti-
cipants of these parties (field notes, January 25th, 2013). In fact, the “people from the
community” Hugo refers to, pertain to the cultural elite of the favela. Aldo (app. C.1) ar-
gues that residents will revolt, if the situation continues evolving in this direction: “It
will be a revolution at some point. The day they make a party on a roof saying it costs R$
200, the residents will block the door and keep the people out, saying 'You are not going
in because it too expensive and that they need to put the price down'”.
In this section I have presented how the arrival of newcomers and the globalisation of
the favela affect Vidigal's party scene. In the period previous to pacification, the pres-
ence of free street parties (among them the funk parties) ensured different forms of en-

tertainment. However, with the arrival of the UPP and the disappearance of these
parties, resentment has emerged among old-timers, who feel unwelcome and cannot af-
ford to participate in the new type of event that is making Vidigal famous for its night-
life. Nonetheless, the problem emerges not only as en economic one. It is social problem
insofar as it deepens the divide between newcomers and old-timers along the lines of
class. Party-goers are not interested in interacting with lower-class favela residents, who
feel exploited and used as a background scenery that supposedly creates the right atmo-
sphere for these new parties.
Finally, I highlighted how lower-class old-timers, a minority in terms of power when
outside the favela, used to be the majority when inside the favela. The impact of gentri-
fication has resulted in a redistribution of power, that relegates the poorer old-timers to
the role of minority also when inside Vidigal. Within this dynamic, a colonisation of the
cultural space appears. Atkinson and Bridge's argument (2005:2) that gentrification is a
“white Anglo appropriation of urban space and urban history” could not be more fitting
when discussing Vidigal's party scene. Exploiting the scenery and the image of the
favela, organisers appropriate the “urban space and urban history”, while taking to Vi-
digal a series of new musical rhythms that are typically Western. In this situation, it is
revealing to note how Mario (app. C.11), who is in charge of the cultural offer of Vidigal
on account of the AMVV, refers to the parties the Association is organising as an attempt
to preserve a cultural and musical history that risks to be lost. Mario talks about the As-
sociation's efforts to organise parties for the community, and highlights the results:
“samba is more intense now, some folkloric parties are coming back. This is us that need
to do this, it can be the Association or other NGO's that are present here. So what we are
trying to do is recovering cultural identity towards the future”. The AMVV, Mario says,
had to take upon itself the role of preserving the “cultural identity” of Vidigal, as the re-
cent changes challenge its existence. The renegotiation of power balances that gentrific-
ation has brought about gives newcomers and middle-class favela residents a dispropor-
tionate influence on the favela, on its inhabitants and on their practices. Albeit a
minority, they have hegemonised the cultural space of the favela.

7.3 -  Everyday Interaction 

During the first days of my field-work I set out to outline the interactions between
newcomers and old-timers. I sat in specific locations that I thought would provide with
interesting interactions to observe. My goal was to obtain a general picture by observing
the way in which people move in the favela, founding my observations in what de Cer-
teau (1984) would call the everyday practice of walking. To my surprise, at the end of
the first day my notebook was as empty as it had been in the morning. There was noth-
ing to observe, I thought with dismay, worried about my field-work's results. New-
comers, who more often than not would stand out pretty easily amongst the crowd,
would pass by my corner or buy something in a shop, with no apparent differences from
what an old-timer would do. It was only in the following days that I would realise how
my eyes were looking for the wrong signs, as there was plenty to observe in what
happened before me (field notes, January 6th, 2013).
The first thing to be noticed was precisely the lack of interaction. As much as I could
recognise newcomers passing by, old-timers could surely do the same. Enrique, a Per-
uvian circus artist I had met on my first day in Vidigal, had told me how he had experi-
enced that in the favelas of the North Zone of Rio a newcomer, and particularly a foreign-
er, would be continuously stopped by old-timers, as people were not used to foreigners
in those areas (field notes, December 30th, 2012). Here in Vidigal I could not see any spe-
cial attention directed towards me or any of the other newcomers that I saw walking the
streets. My informant Hugo recalls how, during one of his first visits in Vidigal, kids fre-
quenting the theatre had surrounded him and asked him for an autograph, as they never
had seen a gringo. The situation appeared to be different in today's Vidigal, and this lack
of interaction became apparent when focusing on who would be walking with whom.
Newcomers tended to walk down the main road together with other newcomers, and
stopped to talk to old-timers only when needed (e.g. when purchasing something in a
shop). On the other hand, old-timers would stop more frequently to talk to other old-

110

timers, as well as they would wave and greet each other very often, also when they did
not stop. Looking at the simple act of walking along the main road of Vidigal, one could
easily recognise social patterns and relations. Michel de Certeau (see section 3.4.2)
pointed out how the everyday practices of city-dwellers are what transforms space into
place. Walking through the city is a way of constructing meaning about it. By zigzagging
from one side of the main road to the other, to exchange a couple of words with other
residents while on the way up or down, old-timers fill the streets of the favela with
meaning. With few exceptions, we have seen in section 5.1.2 how most old-timers re-
gard the sense of community as distinctive of Vidigal, in opposition to the anonymity of
the residents of the richer areas of the South Zone. The interactions that I witnessed
along the main road are part of what shapes the construction of Vidigal as a community,
where residents know and take interest in each others' lives. On the other hand, the
more linear walking of newcomers suggests that the significance of Vidigal for this type
of resident is not to be found in the tight social relationships within the community. This
is in accordance to what we have seen in the previous sections, in which Vidigal
emerged for the newcomers as a scenery for their activities, more than as a place of
genuine interaction with the old-timers.
The purpose of these initial observations was that of understanding the general level
of interaction between newcomers and old-timers, in order to prepare for further obser-
vations and to adjust my interview guide. In the following sections I investigate more in
depth everyday interactions between newcomers and old-timers in Vidigal.
While interviewing newcomers it became clear that they regard their interaction with
the rest of the community in different ways. Ida and Hugo, for example, reflect very pos-
itively on their experiences. Ida (app. C.5) recalls her arrival in Vidigal at a time in which
foreigners and newcomers in general were still rare. Together with her Norwegian
friend Mie, she “went through every alleyway and […] [they] never felt so welcome by a
community”. Likewise, Hugo says that old-timers are happy about newcomers, and that

7.3.1 -  What Kind of Interaction?

Impact on the Social Relations

111

Part II – The Analysis

he never felt like an intruder. Walking along Vidigal's main road with Ida is an interest-
ing experience, as the young British woman greets and is greeted by many of the pass-
ers-by (field notes, January 16th, 2013). However, talking about friendships between old-
timers and newcomers, Ida's friend Lisa, despite not explicitly referring to Ida,
highlights how some of the relationships might not be that genuine after all: 

and I am just appalled because it's just so two-faced.

I have friends here that have a lot more connections and a lot more social networking than I do, I
walk around with them and they know everybody, because they talk to everybody. […] if I am by my-
self [the old-timers] don't think I can understand them and I hear them talk bad about my friends,

call them piranhas [negative expression for a woman that is together with many men], these things,
Lisa, app. C.10 
During my observations I had the constant impression that newcomers (and particu-
larly foreigners) socialised among themselves, with little interaction with the rest of Vi-
digal's residents. Ida (app. C.5) talks about the existence of a community of foreigners:
“that didn't exist before, [a few years ago] it was me and Mie and we knew there was an-
other American girl and we saw one guy from Portugal […]. And that was it. […] [Now]
there is loads of them”. Interestingly, both Timo and Reneé highlight how the large pres-
ence of foreigners tends to isolate them from the rest of the community.
Paul, Timo and Joaño admit that they have not managed to establish successful friend-
ships with the old-timers. Paul (app. C.12) highlights how he knows many old-timers,
but he cannot call them friends: “I know a lot of people from Vidigal, but most of my
friends […] are either foreigners or Brazilians from abroad Vidigal. […] Originally from
the community I haven't got [any]”. Likewise, Timo tells that he has more friends outside
Vidigal than inside. As Paul does, Timo (app. C.18) explicitly refers to the cultural and
class gap between himself and the old-timers, as the reason for the difficulty in the rela-
tionships: “it's […] easy to come close to the people […] that [has the same background]
[…] as you do, like middle-class”. Joaño refers also to a duality between his relations in-
side the favela and those outside of it: “I live in a situation where like my friends from
outside they know my work, […][which] has been published many places, […] but here

112

Impact on the Social Relations

nobody knows. And I don't want anybody to know, because that is giving me a lot of
freedom to learn and then to experience the place.” (ibid.). Joaño positions himself dir-
ectly as an outsider. His contact with the old-timers takes almost the form of an anthro-
pological study, although his 'informants' are not aware of his hidden goals.
Among the old-timers, Renato, Bruno and Sergio tell me that they have no contact
with the newcomers, and in particular with foreigners. Renato (app. C.13) tells: “I don't
[know gringos living here]. Not even one. They must live up there [points towards the
top of the morro], someone must interact with them. I didn't”. Bruno explains that he
does not know many newcomers either, and confirms the general lack of interaction:
[I know only a] few because they don't hang in the same places. I know you because of capoeira,
but if you are in a bar and five gringos come, they sit in a corner talking their language that we

don't understand, while they don't understand ours.  They don't come and  sit and ask  'Can I sit
here?' and don't talk.
Me: So there is not much interaction?
F: No there is not. With them no, because they… they are more… they hang out among themselves.

Bruno, app. C.2
Sergio has not had more contact with newcomers than Renato or Julio have, and the
fact that at the end of our interview he begins asking questions to my Mexican American
translator Daniel, is evidence of the excitement caused by having the possibility of talk-
ing to a foreigner. He justifies himself with a smile: “it's because I never really had con-
versations with foreigners, it's the first time” (app. C.16). Interestingly, Sergio is among
those old-timers who talk about the arrival of newcomers as a positive change for Vidig-
al. Like many old-timers that I met during field-work, Sergio argues that the arrival of
newcomers is a positive change because of two factors. First, the community could have
an economic gain with the arrival of wealthier residents; second, the newcomers' arrival
opens for the possibility of a cultural exchange, particularly in the case of foreign new-
comers (field notes). However, with the lack of direct interaction between old-timers
and newcomers, it is difficult to imagine a cultural exchange taking place. Renato tells: “I
haven't met any foreigner yet. I have seen many in the streets, but to get to know them,

113

Part II – The Analysis

to exchange ideas, to invite them here at home and talk… zero. Zero interaction, for me”.
Old-timer Rita (app. C.15) has had contact with newcomers: “I know Oscar, there is
Karl…There are many, I forget their names. […] Some of them are clients […]. It's easy [to
relate with them]”. However, the reason why she knows newcomers is that they are at-
tracted by her second-hand shop, and converse with Rita when they visit. Asked about
her friends, Rita mentions only old-timers.

7.3.2 -  Interaction and Class:
the Cultural Elite and the Average Favelado

While most of the old-time residents do not interact with newcomers, there seems to
be a few important exceptions. Julio talks about those old-timers connected to the Nós
do Morro theatre company as a cultural elite. He respects their work, he says, but noth-
ing of what they do goes back to the larger community. Likewise, Rita expresses a dislike
towards people connected to the theatre, who could do a lot for Vidigal, but instead are
very snob. Aldo, who is connected to the theatre, confirms the gap among the average
old-timer and the theatre group, and he points at the fact that these creative residents,
when on the beach, sit separately from the rest of the community. At the same time they
are more “eclectic”, they are “a bit crazy, hippie, alternative, […] underground” (app. C.1).
Aldo (ibid.) continues by explaining the role of the theatre company in connecting Vidig-
al to the rest of the city: “Nós do Morro is the first contact with the asfalto. People usually
go there to work, to serve in a restaurant… while this crowd goes there to enjoy it, to get
to know the more glamorous side, and end up making many middle-class friends that
they bring here. […] It's a new thing”.
Reflecting back on the example of the party Mistura Tropical, we can highlight a new
dimension of the interaction between old-timers and newcomers. At Mistura Tropical,
the old-timers that were participating were almost exclusively artists from the theatre.
The house that hosted the party is owned by one of the company's most prominent act-
ors and one of the bands is composed by actors from the theatre. This type of old-timer
is often more middle-class than the average old-time resident, and, if not necessarily

114

Impact on the Social Relations

economically wealthy, it is very wealthy in cultural capital. Furthermore, as we have
seen above (see p.105 and p.107) some of these residents are involved in organising
parties. These residents are capable of brokering the 'favela cool' to newcomers and to
the rest of Rio, and they turn the changes brought about by gentrification in their favour.
This is a type of resident that is sought after by newcomers. While newcomers avoid
contact with average old-timers, they are interested in establishing contact with the cul-
tural elite of the favela, as they are fascinated by the idea of the poor, self-made artist. In
fact, Mistura Tropical aimed at connecting Vidigal's artists with curious people from out-
side the favela. The favela artist is somehow celebrated as he or she fits very well into
the romanticisation of 'the poor'. In this form, interaction among newcomers and old-
timers occurs along class lines. The middle-class newcomers do not interact with lower
class old-time residents. Nonetheless, they do interact with the cultural elite of Vidigal,
rich in cultural capital and often belonging to the favela's middle-class. On page 75 we
have seen how some of the newcomers assume the position of brokers of cool, a posi-
tion identified by David Ley's studies on gentrification (see section 3.5.2). What be-
comes clear here is that this position is not only available to newcomers. Creative old-
timers actively use of the position of 'old-timer' that the new power relations shaped by
the gentrification of the favela make available. They do so by brokering the cultural side
of Vidigal, the arts of the favela, to the newcomers. As a consequence, they gain from the
redistribution of power that gentrification causes.
The newcomers' middle-class values are reflected in their practices and find an ally in
Vidigal's cultural elite. On the other hand, when relating to Vidigal's lower-class resid-
ents, this same set of values is reason for incomprehension and for what appears as an
unbridgeable cultural gap. My informant Till reports of a German friend of his, who had
a conflictual relationship with old-timers:

He was a very German, very straight guy. Like the guy who's right but like too right to live in a
community like this. If somebody threw something on the street […] he went there and said 'Look,
you lost something' […] When someone throws their oil into the gutter […] he'd be like 'Yeah you
shouldn't throw your oil into the gutter you know? You ruin our ground water and our planet is dy-

ing' […]. The guy doesn't want to hear about that. He doesn't want to be lectured by some gringo

about what he does, what he did all his life. Even if [the gringo]'s right.
Till, app. C.17
Till continues by explaining how this type of attitude cannot lead to positive interac-
tions in the favela. He tells:
feel, […] a little bit intimidated by gringos, because gringos have travelled the world. […] And they
come from Gringoland where everything works, they all speak 2-3 languages, they all speak Eng-
Till, app. C.17
When the class division between old-timers and newcomers emerges, relations get
tense. I discussed a similar situation in the previous section (see p.108), when Aldo
foresaw the young old-timers will revolt against the new type of parties being held in Vi-
digal. As we have seen, Till plays a role in the party scene as an organiser, but he does
not seem to draw a parallel between the conflict caused by expensive parties and that
which emerges as a result of everyday life interactions among different favela residents.
However, the unbalanced class relations lie at the root of both cases and Till's account
helps in understanding how class differences are played out in Vidigal's everyday life.
While the cultural elite of Vidigal emerges as a broker of cool and reinforces its position
in the new dynamics that gentrification has opened for, the rest of the favela's inhabit-
ants (its majority), are put “with their back against the wall”. As we have seen, Lees et al.
(2008:123-124) invite us to look at the “broader mechanisms” of gentrification. In sec-
tion 6.1.5, I did so by looking at class. Class emerges here again as a key element of the
new power relations in the favela. While the middle-class old-timers have a possibility
to improve their situation as a consequence of gentrification, what emerges from my in-
formants' accounts is that the lower-class cannot. On the contrary: these residents feel
inferior and they are forced out of their “comfort zone” (Zukin, 2010:4; cfr. p.102). No

116

Impact on the Social Relations

7.3.3 -  New Power Relations in the Favela

position is made available to them, if not as part of a scenery. In this situation, Aldo
seems to wish the revolt, as something that might equilibrate the unbalanced power re-
lations that gentrification has shaped in the favela.
Several newcomer informants refer to old-timers as being jealous of the newcomers.
Till talked about Gringoland and a form of “inferiority complex”. Likewise, Karl (app. C.9)
argues that old-timers are jealous of the newcomers and of their origins: “if you are cool
with them [they admit] they think everything is better [in Europe] […] they want to go
there, that's their dream”. While he is not fully convinced that this is the case, Hugo re-
ports a conversation with some friends: 
I have a few friends who [say] 'Careful Hugo, because there is people who have olho grande [big
laje [rooftop] […] [The old-timers] can be a bit 'Why not me? I have been for so long, why didn't I
manage to get this, a gringo came here and just snapped it from me'.
Hugo, app. C.6
Also Paul (app. C.12) focuses on material inequalities between old-timers and new-
comers, as something that would trigger jealousy: “a few people think that we are full of
money […], and get quite jealous”.
What the different informants report is that the economic and material differences
among old-timers and newcomers are causing conflictual feelings, as many old-timers
are jealous of the newcomers' wealth. According to Hugo's account, this form of jealousy
emerges when the old-timer is confronted with the differences between his or her own
condition and that of the newcomers. These have only recently arrived to Vidigal, but
have gained access to the best resources of Vidigal, as they can afford to pay more.
These class inequalities are also exemplified by the emergence of situations in which
newcomers become the old-timers' employers. Both Karl and Paul discuss about prob-
lems they have encountered when employing local builders. The two newcomers com-

eyes]' They come here and they see you managed to find this place here, you managed to find this

117

Part II – The Analysis

plain about the fact that old-timers are greedy, and that it is impossible to establish a
work relation based on mutual respect. The old-timers “want a lot of money in the short
term”, to say it with Paul's words (app. C.12). Karl (app. C.9), after bad experiences with
local workforce, explains that he now prefers to hire foreigners: “better you get some-
body from the outside, that you at least stay in power control”. Timo reports a case of a
couple of Brazilian newcomers who has hired their neighbour as cleaning lady: 

I just met with a Brazilian guy that I know here, that is not from Vidigal, I met another person
that moved here too […] one year ago […]. And we sat at the table and they were going on about, if
they do their houses themselves or if they get someone for cleaning, and then he told very openly
that he asked his neighbour and that she can use all the money she can get and she does stuff like
that all day anyway and has no other job and she is absolutely glad about the fact that she can earn
money with that.

Timo, app. C.18
Timo, who assumes the position of social preservationist (see section 6.2.2), ex-
presses indignation for this kind of relation between neighbours. The power relations in
this case assume the traditional vertical pattern of employer-employee, in which the
wealthy newcomer is no longer the old-timer's neighbour, but rather her employer. This
is a very drastic change compared to the more horizontal relations that many new-
comers and old-timers refer to when talking about a community such as Vidigal. With
the arrival of newcomers, class dynamics do not only produce a divide due to different
sets of values or tastes, but are also directly reproduced inside Vidigal, shaping new
power balances. Aldo compares his personal story with this new pattern in Vidigal: 
I used to work at the Sheraton, and the gringo was my master, I saw the gringo as a master.
Today I can say I have been interviewed by New York Times, I talked about Cannes where the gringo

was my fan. […] From master to fan to friend. And today I can see it with this view, […] and there is
no more hierarchy for me. […] But if you only serve, it's difficult to get out of it, and if you see these
people who have always had more money get the house next to yours and become your neighbour, it
has a bit of a good thing, but it has this strange competition thing.

Aldo, app. C.1

118

Impact on the Social Relations

Similarly, Danilo uses the city of Bahia as example, when he explains where he thinks
the current changes in Vidigal will lead:

Many foreigners have started to discover it [a small city in the state of Bahia] and started buying.
The local people that lived there are now all employed by the foreigners, who are getting even rich-
er. Because the city has lot of tourism. […] They are all owners of hotel, hostels, they are all foreign-
ers. But the people that was born there, they get minimum wage, and many are even exploited by
owners. This will happen in Rio, in Vidigal.

Danilo, app. C.3
What these old-timers suggest is that the arrival of newcomers has an impact in the
dynamics of the favela, as it compromises both the social and the power relationships of
the place. This begins with the old-timers' feeling of inferiority and the consequent jeal-
ousy that some newcomers have reported, and continues to the new kind of relations
that are established in the favela. In these, old-timers begin to have subordinate rela-
tions to the newcomers, who are now paying the old-timers' salaries. What we are wit-
nessing in Vidigal is the appearance of power dynamics previously unseen in the favela.
Bruno reports how, in the city, people would label him as a favelado  because of his
clothes and his way of talking. He explains that this form of prejudice is no longer lim-
ited to the richer areas of the city:

If the police gets here now, they will treat you well, when you say you come from outside, they
will treat you well, but with me it's going to be a problem, they will put me to the wall, and when I
begin to talk […]'I live there I work with moto-taxi'. […] he sees that I am not the kind of person that
I might look like I am.

Bruno, app. C.2
While favela-dwellers would be confronted with this kind of prejudice when outside
the favela, the rurality and particularity of the place favela had somehow protected
them, keeping these conflicts outside their homes. Class did not emerge as an issue in

119

7.3.4 -  Partial Conclusion

the old-timers' accounts of the times previous to gentrification, despite the diversified
population that lived in Vidigal. Nonetheless, Bruno's account shows how the question
of class has now appeared within the 'safe walls' of the favela. With Vidigal becoming a
globalised place, it is now witnessing the appearance of some of the conflicts that it did
not experience before.
In this section I examined how interaction between old-timers and newcomers is
scarce and often conflictual. Some newcomers might have arrived with a genuine in-
terest in interacting with the old-timers, but for the most they have encountered diffi-
culties in establishing successful relationships, and very few are the positive examples of
interaction that emerge from my informants. Likewise, while many old-timers regard
the arrival of newcomers as an opportunity for cultural exchange, the cultural gap is of-
ten too wide to produce any form of meaningful interaction. The theme of class emerges
strongly, influencing both social and power relations in different ways. The cultural elite
of Vidigal has found itself in a privileged position, as its cultural capital has facilitated in-
teraction with newcomers. This group, richer in cultural capital than the average fave-
lado, has also been capable of defining for itself a position of broker of the favela cool to
the outside. On the other hand, lower-class old-timers have experienced very little to no
interaction with Vidigal's new residents. The examples reported in this section indicate
that the gap between middle-class newcomers and lower-class old-timers might be very
difficult, if not impossible, to bridge. Furthermore, they point in the direction of a repro-
duction of class differences inside the favela that alters the power relations in the area.
Throughout this chapter I presented and analysed how the arrival of a new type of
resident to Vidigal has impacted different areas of the favela's life. Housing, parties and
the everyday interactions are themes that recur in my empirical material, and they
guided this part of the analysis. What emerges is a picture of social relations in Vidigal
that are changing rapidly due to the current gentrification of the favela. The problem

Part II – The Analysis

120

Impact on the Social Relations

emerges not only in the form of displacement due to rising real-estate value, but also as
what Chernoff (1980 in Brown-Saracino, 2004:138) calls “social displacement”. In this
form of displacement, one group is replaced by another “in terms of prestige and
power”. The favela, that was conceptualised as a contested place on page 23, sees its bal-
ance of power shifting, as we witness the arrival of a new type of resident.

I think that when the foreigner comes here, they go
after this side more…  It can be  a trip, it can be  crazy
from my side, but I think they go more after the under-

is, want to interact with the poorest part, want to inter-
act with the favela that has five kids. I think it's this part
of the favela… this part. My house [a very modern open

Renato, app. C.13
In this thesis I investigated the phenomenon of gentrification in the favela of Vidigal,
Rio de Janeiro. The question that has guided this research (as stated on p.15) is: 

Which constructions of place emerge with the arrival of a new type of resident to Rio's
favela Vidigal, and how do these constructions and the newcomers' practices affect the so-
cial relations of the residents of the favela?

I approached the issue at two different but interrelated levels. Firstly, I analysed in
chapter 6 why newcomers move to Vidigal, the way in which they construct the favela as
place and in which they articulate and practice the authentic favela. In particular, I iden-
tified two different dominant representations of the favela: as place of resistance and as
creative hub. These representations are articulated by newcomers in tight connection
with a claim of moral ownership over the authenticity of Vidigal, thereby norming what

124

Conclusion

is to be understood as good and as bad practice. Furthermore, such representations
make available a number of subject positions for both newcomers and old-timers. In
particular, I have highlighted the position of the so-called 'social preservationists' for
what concerns the newcomers and of the cultural elite of Vidigal for what concerns the
old-timers.
 Secondly, I focused in chapter 7 on how these constructions and the newcomers'
practices affect the everyday life of the favela. The impact of the arrival of newcomers
has been analysed with particular focus on three main themes that pertain the favela's
everyday life. Such impact has to be understood as a result of the ongoing power
struggles to define what the favela is, and, more fundamentally, who has the right to
define it.
As mentioned in section 3.4.1, I approached this research with an understanding of
the favela as a contested place, in which different relations of power are at work to fill its
spatiality with meaning. Gentrification has been understood as a political process that
affects the power relations of a neighbourhood, challenging the ways in which place is
given meaning. Throughout this thesis it has emerged that gentrification poses a chal-
lenge to the existing representations of the favela, by incorporating new representations
into the manner the favela is made into place. Newcomers celebrate Vidigal for its au-
thenticity, which is articulated both as origins – the favela as different from the rest of
Rio and from the Western capitals because of its rurality and history of resistance – and
as new beginnings – the favela as a place in which creativity can be let loose. Despite the
different perceptions of what is authentic in Vidigal, the vast majority of newcomers
share features that emerge when analysing their practices in the favela. As I pointed out
in chapter 6, the favela is constructed by newcomers as a romantic, simple and un-
spoiled place, that in its rurality and in its horizontal community relations has not been
undermined by capital or globalisation. These new residents construct it, in different
ways, as an alternative to the homogeneity that they perceive dominates the world's cit-
ies in a globalised time. In this operation, poor becomes synonymous of honest and
down-to-earth. Nonetheless, both in the choice of the favela they choose to move to and
in their interactions once they have moved to Vidigal, newcomers only use the favela

125

Part III - Conclusion

and its residents as background scenery for what can be described as traditionally
middle-class lives and lifestyles. Newcomers living in the favela are attracted by a sanit-
ised, ready for consumption version of the favela they have seen in the film City of God
and on the media. Vidigal emerges as cool, underground and different, which are
keywords for those alternative urban types that make for the majority of Vidigal's new
residents. The favela and its residents appear as no more than scenery also when the
favela is branded to the outside.
Chasing this diversity, this authenticity, newcomers move to Vidigal rather than to
other, more dangerous or less central favelas. Once in Vidigal, they entertain relations
among themselves or with the favela's own middle-class. As Renato's words at the be-
ginning of this conclusion suggest, newcomers have specific expectations about what
the authentic favela is, and they look for that favela, ignoring the rest. The newcomers
often emerge as tourists in the favela: they participate in a thrilling experience, life in
the favela, but at the same time they are just 'watching'. They do not want to 'get dirty'
by coming in contact with what they observe.
The ways in which place is constructed by newcomers would provide for a fine and
exciting academic discussion, but would also be limited to that, if the consequences of
these constructions did not affect the lives of thousands of favela-dwellers. In fact, these
representations and their consequent practices challenge the social relations in the
favela in various manners. To begin with, I highlighted in chapter 7 the disruption of so-
cial ties that is often considered inherent in gentrification processes. Particularly
through displacement, social networks and ties are severed, re-shaping the geography of
the favela. If the gentrification of the favela is not halted, many more of Vidigal's poorer
residents will be either displaced or bought-out by money offers that they could not re-
fuse.Also in chapter 7 I highlighted how gentrification in the favela builds on existing class
distinctions. Nevertheless, class appears into the favela as a previously unseen problem-
atic category. Conflicts and power dynamics that favela residents would only face when
leaving the favela, have now moved inside Vidigal, bringing the conflict directly into the
old-timer's homes. Most newcomers (typically middle-class) have managed to build suc-

Conclusion

cessful relationships only with middle-class favela residents and particularly with Vi-
digal's cultural elite. This group of old-timers has managed to carve for itself a role in
the 'new' Vidigal, providing the most positive example of how gentrification can benefit
the old-timer population. For them, the current changes brought about by gentrification
might be a life changer for the better. However, for the rest of Vidigal's old-timers the
situation might not be as positive. While Vidigal's cultural elite has the possibility to gain
from gentrification, due to the new positions that the authentic representations of Vidig-
al offer them, the majority of Vidigal's residents is presented with only one position: the
old-timer can only be an old-timer. The old-timers' presence emerges as necessary for
the continuity of the representations of the favela that newcomers present. The social
preservationists, one could say, are simply those newcomers that are more conscious
about this process, and that attempt to preserve the old-timers and their lifestyle in or-
der to ensure the reproduction of the place that they, the social preservationists, have
fallen for. But if any of the lower-class old-timer population will still be living in Vidigal
in a few years from now, it is not unreasonable to imagine that social relations will have
changed to an extent that these residents will have lost the community in which they
had their roots. In particular, the change from a neighbour-to-neighbour relation to the
employer-employee relation can have dramatic consequences for the geography of the
favela.New power and social relations are emerging in Vidigal, as the economic and cultural
differences between poorer old-timers and newcomers shape new hierarchies internal
to the favela. The redistribution of power that gentrification brings about has also mar-
ginalised Vidigal's numeric majority (the lower-class old-timers). This group becomes a
minority in terms of power over the definition of the place favela, with the resulting feel-
ings of exclusion that I presented in chapter 7. This development exemplifies how the
power dynamics inside Vidigal have been affected by gentrification, and it appears as
one of the biggest challenges for the future of Vidigal.
In this situation, both old-timers and newcomers are unanimous in their prediction:
Vidigal is changing, and it might change to an extent that will make it unrecognisable in
the future. Where this change will lead the favela is yet unknown. Current trends sug-

127

Part III - Conclusion

gest that the fear expressed by some of my informants – Vidigal becoming Rio's Beverly
Hills in the next decade – might not be unfounded. Fostered by the upcoming mega-
events, gentrification in Vidigal may well lead to a change that will make the favela unre-
cognisable in just a few years. Meanwhile, the newcomers, and among them also those
that I have identified as social preservationists, which declare themselves concerned for
the faith of the favela and of its residents, fail in understanding their role and impact in
the current changes.
What are, then, the contributions of this thesis? Three main themes have emerged,
which I hope can contribute to a broader and more in-depth discussions on this issue.
Firstly, I have highlighted in my analysis how this 'where-no-white-man-has-set-foot-
before' kind of coolness has a very colonial aura to it. This emerged also when analysing
the party scene, in which Western music rhythms have become dominant, while Brazili-
an rhythms have to be preserved with the efforts of the Association of residents. Under-
standing gentrification as a colonisation process might provide with an interesting in-
sight in this process and in the forms of resistance to it. Furthermore, the emergence of
slum gentrification, with cases being reported also in Indian slums (see for instance The
Australian, 2011), might give to the colonial perspective even more relevance.
Secondly, the craving for an authentic place that brings newcomers to Vidigal is de-
structing the very thing that attracted them to being with. Vidigal's perceived authenti-
city is threatened, as more newcomers make it their home or venture up the morro to
party. The French anarchist collective Comité Invisble [The Invisible Committee] wrote in
its political tract The Coming Insurrection:

This taste for the “authentic”, and for the control that goes with it, accompanies the
petty bourgeoisie in its colonization of working class neighborhoods. Pushed out of the city
centers, they find on the frontiers the kind of “neighborhood feeling” they missed in the
prefab houses of suburbia. By chasing out the poor people, the cars, and the immigrants,
by making it all tidy, by getting rid of all the germs, the petty bourgeoisie wipes out the
very thing it came looking for.

The Invisible Committee, 2009:53

128

Conclusion

Not dissimilar is the situation in the favela. Ironically, newcomers normalise and
thereby spoil what they perceive as different and authentic, in particular through their
impact on the social relations of the community that they so much praise.
Lastly, Vidigal proves to be a very interesting case of gentrification in a globalised
world. The arrival of numerous foreign newcomers, attracted by the perceived authenti-
city of the favela, is indeed a dynamic that is worth underlining in this conclusion. The
emergence of the global trademark favela has certainly played a role. This process has
projected the favela to a global level, romanticising certain features and making it ready
for consumption at the hands of the urban globetrotters that seek new authentic experi-
ences. These foreigners' personal search for the authentic takes them across oceans and
continents to move to a favela. Doing this they chase, at a global level, the ideal of the au-
thentic. This authentic appears as something that cannot be found in the Western capit-
als these foreigners come from, that are labelled as homogeneous hell-holes, to para-
phrase Kunzru (see p.36). Gentrification, then, goes global. Not in the 'traditional'
understanding that it is a process that happens everywhere and not only in London or in
the North American megalopolises but also in rural England or in Beijing. It goes global
in the understanding that the flow of gentrifers becomes global.

Appendix

Appendix A -  Presentation of the informants

Aldo is 34 years old and was born in Vidigal. He is part of the Nós do Morro group, and he is one
the film directors that has filmed 5x favela – Agora por nós mesmos  (2010), and 5x pacificação
(2012). He has been to Cannes film festival with 5x favela, and tells me that he sometimes feels like
he is living in two parallel universes. One day he is at cocktail party on a yacht, fetched by a lim-
ousine, and the day after he is at a rooftop party in a favela. We meet for the interview in the shade
under the trees of the garden of the theatre.
I decide to contact Armando when I hear he has written a book about Vidigal. I hope to get my
hands of the book, as well as to hear more about the struggles of Vidigal in the 1970s. I find Ar-
mando asking around in different bars, and I am accompanied directly to his door within the first
half hour of my endeavour. He is 71 years old and owns a mini-van, with which he helps people mov-
ing. He has lived in Vidigal since 1959, following his family, that migrated from the state of Paraiba.
He has been President of the Association of residents and is now honorary member. A street in Vi-
digal is named after him. We meet for the interview at his house, and my translator Daniel comes
along. At the end of the interview, Armando signs a copy of the book and gives it to me.
I meet Bruno at the free capoeira classes offered by the AMVV. He is very outgoing, and we begin
talking very quickly. He is flattered by the fact that I would like to interview him, and we find quickly
a time and date. Bruno is 28 years old and was born and raised in Vidigal, in the house his grandpar-
ents built. He works as a moto-taxi driver, and in his spare time he plays as a DJ at parties.
Danilo is 38 years old, he works as producer and as location hunter for other productions that
want to film in Vidigal, where he was born and raised. Rosa puts me in contact with him, as she
thinks Danilo is always full of stories and anecdotes that could help my research. Danilo begins talk-
ing as soon as I meet him and it is very difficult to get him to focus on one single question of theme
at a time. Daniel begins translating for me, while we walk to see the house where he was born and
then back to a quiet corner where we can sit. Danilo stands up while we sit, he plays with his long

dreadlocks, moves around and shows me picture of him with French actor Vincent Cassel and other
famous people he has met through his work. He is by far the most difficult informant and I leave the
interview with an annoyed feeling. It is first when I get home and I listen to the recordings again,
that I realise that Rosa was entirely right.
I hear about Dora's story from another informant, when we are chatting and I ask about someone
who had to leave Vidigal because of the increase in real estate value. Dora was born and raised in Vi-
digal, and has been an actress connected to the theatre Nós do Morro since she was a kid. She is a
34-year-old single mother and she is living with her mum, while she is waiting to move to a new
house she bought in the West Zone of Rio, as she couldn't afford to buy a house like the one she
wanted in Vidigal.
Hugo is a French hair-dresser and make-up artist. He is 45 years old has lived in Vidigal since
2011, but has known the favela and collaborated with the theatre for about seven years before that.
He now works in a hair-dresser salon in Leblon. Hugo lives with his partner on a small and colourful
brick-house they have built themselves on the roof of a friend's house, where we meet for the inter-
view. I have met him at the dinner party where I had met Ida for the second time, as the two are
friends and often work together. When he welcomes me on his roof, Hugo starts talking right away,
in good English but with recurring Portuguese expressions. I have to hurry in taking the voice re-
corder out and begin recording. Hugo's interview is the first one of this field-work. During our con-
versation, I let him lead me into several themes that I will then approach again during other inter-
views.
Ida is a 26 year old hair stylist and make-up artist from England, who arrived to Vidigal in 2011. I
get to know her while looking for a room to rent, as she is trying to help a friend renting out his
house. Her eccentric clothing and make-up are easily recognisable from afar every time I meet her
outside. I meet her again at dinner party with other foreign newcomers, where I hear her talking
about pacification, the community and about the fact that everyone in Vidigal knows her. She agrees
to an interview, and we meet in front of her wooden hut built of recycled materials, sitting on a
couch Ida and a friend have built from doors they found in the rubbish. Dom, Ida's London-based

143

Polish friend and make-up artist, makes us tea while we sit and chat.
João is a contact that I obtain through Rosa. I choose to interview him as he is a Brazilian new-
comer that has worked with some of Rio's favelas' issues. Joaño is 29 years old and comes from
Paraiba, in the north of Brazil. He has lived and worked in Haiti, and has recently graduated from his
master from Harvard University, where he studied Public Policy Design and wrote his dissertation
on the UPP. He has moved to Vidigal in the end of 2011. He has founded what he defines as a social
movement, called Cidades Unida [United Cities], in which he works with different favelas to involve
residents in decision making. He proudly explains that the project has just won a UNHabitat prize,
that will provide them funding to start a project on land titling in the favelas. We meet on the porch
of his little one room apartment, just a few meters from the hostel Alto Vidigal. After the interview,
he invites me to surf with him.
I read about Julio in an article on the blog Rio On Watch (2012c). He is presented as a photo-
grapher and community leader, and I obtain his e-mail through the blog's editor. We meet on a hot
morning in front of the AMVV, where we borrow a room to sit and talk. He is 27 years old and very
friendly. He was born in Ipanema, but his family moved to Vidigal when he was two, three months
old. He has grown up in the favela with his politically engaged father. I enjoy his attitude from the
outset, despite other informants had warned me about him, due to an old political grudge. The inter-
view is in Portuguese.
Karl is 35 years old and is the Austrian owner of hostel and party location Alto Vidigal, that he
bought in 2009. Probably one of the most famous newcomers in Vidigal, Karl has been at the centre
of a dispute over a housing property with another foreigner. The conflict has brought his name on
both local and international press (The Guardian, 2013 and The Washington Post, 2013). I decide to
interview him as he is a newcomer working in the favela, and we agree on a meeting a few days later.
When I am at the hostel to talk to him the first time I meet a journalist from the Guardian who is
waiting to interview him (field notes). On the day of the interview Karl is too busy, as a Brazilian film
production is shooting a scene inside the hostel. We reschedule for a few days later. While we sit on
the hostel's veranda with a splendid view in front of us, a television troupe from Brazilian TV chan-

nel Globo enters the door to interview some of the hostel's guests.
I meet Lisa through my informant Ida, as the two are friends. I chat shortly with Lisa at our first
encounter, and her claim of feeling in a social experiment by living in Vidigal strikes me. We meet
again for an interview a few days later. Lisa is 26 years old, has grown up in California and has been
living in Vidigal since, 2010. She had come to Rio on holiday without any clear plan, but she ended
up staying, as at a baile funk party in Vidigal, she met Rodrigo a young man from Rocinha who is now
her husband. She now teaches English in a language school.
Mario is employed at the Associaçaño dos Moradores da Vila do Vidigal [Association of residents of
the village of Vidigal – AMVV] and is responsible of cultural events within the favela. He is 50 years
old, and his family has lived in Vidigal for generations. I meet him at my first visit at the AMVV, while
I was looking for another contact that I had been told worked there. Mario took me immediately to a
room in the back of the office, where we sat and chatted freely for about one hour. Before saying
goodbye we agree on meeting again for an actual interview. Mario does not speak English, and at
this second meeting, also in the office of the AMVV, my translator Daniel is present. Before leaving
the office, Mario promises copies of a few documents about Vidigal in his possession. I come and
fetch them a couple of days later (see app. E).
Paul is, together with Oscar, my first land-lord. The two Frenchmen have bought the house togeth-
er back in 2011, and have worked on it ever since. He is 31 years old and comes from southern
France, where he works as a gardener during the summer months, to then travel in winter. I ask him
for an interview after I have moved out from their house on the top of the morro. He agrees, but we
do not manage to meet until about two weeks later, when I follow him to the Vidigal beach and inter-
view him on the shore.
Renato is a young photographer that works mostly with cinema. He is 26 and was born and
raised in Vidigal, where he joined the theatre company Nós do Morro at the age of 13. He is newly
wed, and his wife has moved in with him only three weeks before our interview. I hear about him
from Rosa, that introduces him as having an interesting vision about the current changes in Vidigal.

145

Appendix

Rosa does not have his phone number, so I try my luck and begin asking around if anyone knows
him. The second person I ask is his little brother's girlfriend's mother, who gives me Renato's num-
ber. We meet at his place, a very stylish open-space next to theatre, in the richer area of Vidigal. It's a
big, single square room, tastefully furnished and with a splendid view over the favela. Renato begins
by proudly showing me the posters hanging on the wall. They are the posters of the film 5x favela –
Agora por nós mesmos [five times favela, now by ourselves] and the documentary 5x pacificação [five
times pacification]42. Renato tells me he has taken the picture for the for first film's poster, and he
has filmed the whole documentary. We then sit by the window and start the interview while drink-
ing juice, and we are interrupted three times by friends coming by with film props for a short film
Renato is going to shoot the day after. The interview is in Portuguese.
René arrives late to our meeting, and he jokes that it is Brazil that had made him into the kind of
person that comes late. He is a 27 year old Frenchman, who has lived in Vidigal since 2008. I get to
know through my informant Rosa. Reneé arrived to Rio as an exchange student, and decided to come
back for a Ph.D. In physics after he finished his studies in Paris. He lives in a small apartment in the
middle of the favela, together with a Brazilian friend. We sit in plastic chairs outside the front door,
and we begin the interview. Reneé does not feel comfortable speaking English, so Daniel translates
from Portuguese.
Rita is one of my 'anonymous' old-timer informants, as she has not been chosen for her job or
civic engagement, but simply for being an old-time resident born and raised in Vidigal. She is 51
years old and owns, together with the rest of her family, a big house in the lower part of Vidigal. Part
of the house is rented out, while Rita works on a daily basis on a second-hand shop she has created
herself. The shop is colourful and very creative, and Rita shows me around me with pride, the first
time I enter it out of curiosity. She tells me how she is planning to open a bar in one of the rooms,
“something stylish”, she says, with space for DJ's and a chilled atmosphere (field notes). When I come
back a second time, she is flattered that I would like to interview her, and she invites me to come by
42 5x favela (2010) is a film portraying five scenes of everyday life in five of Rio's favelas. The directors are
born in the same favelas, and the project aimed at showing favela life from an insider's perspective, while
at the same time promoting favela-born artists. 5x pacificação (2012) is a more recent documentary dis-
cussing the pacification process, and it is directed by four of the seven directors of 5x favela.

whenever I want. I show up with chocolate cake and with Daniel, my translator, a couple of days
after. We sit in the back room of the shop, and talk while drinking coffee.
I get in contact with Rosa through her website Vidiga!, that reports news about Vidigal while pro-
moting tourism and culture. Rosa is 30 years old and works as a freelance journalist while finishing
a course in communication, that she started after she dropped out of the Faculty of Journalism. She
is originally from Saño Paulo, and has lived in Vidigal since 2011. She is very active in the community.
Despite the fact that she is one of informants whose empirical material I use the least, she has been
extremely helpful in facilitating contact with other Vidigal residents.
Sergio moved to Vidigal when he was two months old, and he considers himself as a cria [native].
He is 37 years old and works as doorman in an apartment building in Leblon. He is married and
father to two young kids. I meet him through his wife, who works at an açaí [a typical Brazilian drink
made of frozen berries] shop close to where I live. I visit the wife's shop on a daily basis to drink
açaí, but when I ask her if I could interview her, she says that the husband would agree, but she
prefers not to. Sergio agrees to be interviewed, after I reassure him that his worries of not having
anything interesting to say are unfounded. We meet together with Daniel, my translator, in his house,
which strikes both me and Daniel for the very polished details in its interior. At the end of the inter-
view, the roles are swapped, as Sergio begins to ask questions to me and Daniel (a Mexican American
who has lived in Rio for several years), stating that this is the first time he had a chance to talk to a
gringo. He is interested in why Daniel permanently lives in Vidigal, what his dreams are and what he
thinks of the community.
I hear about Till when I ask who made the map of Vidigal that I have seen hanging in a couple of
bars (see app. D). He is a 38 years old German, who has lived in Vidigal since 2010. He had lived 7
years in Saño Paulo before moving to Rio, and his ex-wife and son still live there, which is why Till
travels often between the two cities. Together with a friend Till started the design company Vidigalo,
that has also produced the map I had seen around. However, he tells me during the interview how he
is soon going to begin in a position for an advertisement company. During the interview we sit in
front of his house, while a mix of German and Brazilian friends is finalising the preparation for the

147

Appendix

next party Morro Electrônico, that Till is part of organising.
The first time I see Timo he stands out as the only white man playing in Vidigal's samba band,
during a public pre-Carnival rehearsal in the square at the entrance of the favela. I approach him af-
terwards, and when he shows interest for my research, I ask him if he would agree to an interview.
We meet one evening a few days later in front of a beer, on the small tables of the bar Campista, near
the top of Vidigal. Timo is 30 years old and comes from Berlin. He has lived in Vidigal for only a
couple of months, while he still works for a German company for which he does IT support. He has
lived in Mozambique before Brazil, and he is fascinated by the Portuguese language and by Brazilian
music.

The interview is conducted in Portuguese.
Me: How is the relation between the group from the theatre and the other residents?
A: [Laughs] It's a funny relation. It's good, because they are friends, but it's different. Do you remem-
ber the film City of God? Do you remember the Cocotas [Groovies]? They are the crowd on the beach,
the white ones, it's similar, they smoke weed and have crazy hair. People are seen that way here. Like
the Cocotas in City of God a bit crazy, hippie, alternative, pretty. The teenagers have a lot of success
with girls. They are a bit gallant. And there is this idea they are more crazy, more underground.
There is this relation between the community and these people. It's fun.
Me: Do you have examples of this relation, of the fact that the people here think they are hippies?
A: I think the beach, there is a beach here, the Vidigal beach, the Sheraton. On the beach you can see
that the group, some people from Nós do Morro, sit separately from the rest of the community, it's
like a group of them a bit away. It's like City of God. There it's already a bit differentiated. And the
way of dressing, it's perceived different. The people from Nós do Morro, the majority dresses differ-
ently. Because here funk and pagode are very strong, the Nós do Morro makes you eclectic, you listen
to more MPB [Brazilian Popular Music], you enjoy it. Not that people here don't like, but I'm talking
about the majority, generalising…This brings different styles. I like to keep closer to them, a style
more rap, more funk, but people here has a more artistic side.
Me: What kind of clothing then, an example of someone that comes here
A: Here you can meet, for instance the hair, the men hair is usually trimmed, short, while here it's
bigger, it's afro, the black women make something out of it, you can see that already, the hair is
already a brand. I think it's more colourful, you can look at them, they have more style. They are
cooler, I think the majority wears more common things, in a more generic. Nós do Morro has a differ-
ent way of dressing, the behaviour is different.
Me: I see. There are also some parties, we talked just now about a party called Mistura Tropical, here
in the house of…
A: Of Marcelo?
Me: Yes. Then you also have parties in which the crowd from the theatre attracts more people from
the outside than residents. Is that true?
A: Yes. It does because most of them have on TV. People are curious to get to know Vidigal, to get to
know the favela. Especially those that study anthropology, they are very curious. Nós do Morro is the
first contact with the asfalto. People usually go there to work, to serve in a restaurant… while this
crowd goes there to enjoy it, to get to know the more glamorous side, and end up making many
middle-class friends that they bring here. They bring them. It's a fact. It's a new thing I would say,
since the group turned famous, the actors, it attracts many people. If you search on YouTube, there is
kid called Michael Borges, he's an actor, he's in a series, a series for teenagers, for the TV, called Re-
beldes [rebels], and I saw a group of young girls talking 'I'm in Vidigal, I came here where Michael

Borges lives, I wanted to see him, I am going up the street now'.
I think there should be a priority system, but we live in a capitalist world, I think it should be like, if
you have lived here many years you have priority over those that don't live here. If you want to live
here you can rent before him. But no, it's money that rules. If you have more you get to live here. This
ends up making something that… For example, I used to work at the Sheraton, and the gringo was
my master, I saw the gringo as a master. Today I can say I have been interviewed by New York Times,
I talked about Cannes where the gringo was my fan. The inversion of values the art gave me. From
master to fan to friend. And today I can see it with this view, so I have the same way of seeing things,
and there is no more hierarchy for me. For me this has the same value as you. But if you only serve,
it's difficult to get out of it, and if you see these people who have always had more money get the
house next to yours and become your neighbour, it has a bit of a good thing, but it has this strange
competition thing.
29:18We don't want the middle-class to come here only to parties, but we want them to come to help us.
That's it. But they don't, they only come to have a good time. So I don't know if that is cool, until
when it's cool. And the culture here is becoming like this, parties that cost a lot on someone's roof.
People don't want culture to become that. The opposite, people earn little here, they want things to
be cheap. This is not only here, also in Santa Marta. It's like you took my rooftop to make a barbecue,
and I couldn't come in. I was in a party in Santa Marta that costed R$ 200. I went to this party, I
didn't pay because I am an artist and I was invited, but there was no one from the favela, maybe 3-4.
Inside a quadra de samba, and it's absurd. The quadra was made for people to enjoy on Saturday.
Things can turn like that soon, things cost 50-70-100, they have started making parties here with
this price and the favela is not going to enjoy them. This is not cool. It's exclusion, it bothers me.
Me: They told me about it, that it is much more expensive up on the top because the gringos want
the view, while before it was cheaper because it is far from the entrance.
A: The real estate issue is absurd here. It's absurd. Who has a house can't sell. The only good thing of
Vidigal is that Vidigal has this culture of revolution. Like the piece Bandeiras de Retalhos talks about
the removal that they tried many years ago. Did you see the piece here?
Me: Yes I have seen it, I would like to talk about it later too.
A: They tried to take the quadra on the top and Rosa was arrested, and the people got… This is cool,
the residents here have this cultural thing a bit slow, but of revolution. It will be a revolution at some
point. The day they make a party on a roof saying it costs R$ 200, the residents will block the door
and keep the people out, saying 'You are not going in because it too expensive and that they need to
put the price down'.
Me: Has this happened already?
A: Not yet, but it can happen.

C.2 -  Bruno

The interview is conducted in Portuguese.
Me: Do you know already any of these new people that have gotten here? Gringos or people from the
asfalto?
B: A few people. Few because they don't hang in the same places. I know you because of capoeira,
but if you are in a bar and five gringos come, they sit in a corner talking their language that we don't
understand, while they don't understand ours. They don't come and sit and ask 'Can I sit here?' and
don't talk.
Me: So there is not much interaction?
B: No there is not. With them no, because they… they are more… they hang out among themselves.
As I was telling you, that we began talking about something else. The gringo from down there, not
the ones from here, the ones from here are here to work, to build a future, but many down there go
to party in a favela, pay R$ 40 for what? For weed, cocaine, for drugs. Understand? They don't come
here to dance and enjoy it and hug me like 'Wow dude you live here? You are warrior!'. He doesn't
hug me, he comes and he 'Hey what do I do to sort a little thing [drugs] out?'. Understand? He
doesn't come with that idea. Because I live here in the community and I don't pay R$ 40 for a party
here. I don't. I prefer down there in the Melt, where it's 25-30, I go [names two bars] where I see
famous and beautiful people, it's much cheaper and the drinks are bigger.
Me: At the beginning of the interview you also said that people used to help each other a lot with
electricity, with water, with all this. And many people here told me about the feeling of community,
that people help each other and so on. What does community mean for you?
B: Man, community for me is the following. It is knowing how to live close to one another. This is the
community, in my head. Not all the world thinks this way, but I think it should be like this. It should
be compulsory to think like this. If the neighbour has no gas, if I have a spare one at home, I lend her
my extra tank, then she will go and work and buy a new one and give it to me. The neighbour feels
bad, I feel bad, the neighbour knows it and acts. He would get his car and take me.
Me: You just talked about gringos, are there also many Brazilians that are coming here, who are not
traditional favelados, or… ?
B: Damn, there are many that come here which are good people with manners, but there are many
others that live here that don't have manners. An example: I live here. You can see here and it's all
clean, but you come here tomorrow and there will be some trash here, some there in the ditch. The

42:20

Appendix

guy could take his trash to the bin over there, and instead of doing his role in the community, throw-
ing the trash out there, he will throw trash in the middle of the streets. You understand? And another
comes by and sees it and throws something as well. Here there is both good and bad people passing
by. And there are these neighbours without manners and no one ever knows who it is that does that,
because people don't see who does that. Because if people saw it, everyone would go up to the per-
son, everyone would take the trash and throw it in front of his door. You never know who it is. There
is another that sees the trash on the ground, me as well, sometimes I am here and I throw it out in
the bin, because going down I am passing by the bin, so I go down and throw it there.
There is people here man, that from the very window, the guy is at the window 'There is no one
down there' and 'phoom!' [mimes throwing something out of the window] and 'puff', and waits for
the rain to take it all away. Understand? It's this that people can call favelado. This is a favelado, un-
derstand? Because it's like this: favelado, the name favelado doesn't come from where you live, it
comes from the way you behave. Understand? It's your behaviour that tells society if you are a fave-
lado or not. Understand? You see me… we know each other from capoeira, we are talking here now,
you know that down there I would meet people that I don't know. Down there in the mall or in a
shop, there is a line and I would let an old lady before go before me. This is my way of conduct. Down
there, others would judge me like this, because of my Flamengo jersey, the Nike shoes or my way of
talking, and they would say 'Hey this dude lives in a favela', he has Nike shoes and all. They won't see
me like Mister Cash with a tie. They won't. As there are many down there that have a tie, that work
in a bank, at a desk... there is people down there that say 'Damn! The dude...' rich and good people...
getting out of the bank, you know these robberies in the bank, people getting out the bank, you are
with your t-shirt [not understandable] and a guy that has a tie, because the one with a tie won't [not
understandable] it is not a thing from the favela here, you get down there with those clothes, until
we open our mouths we are just favelados. When you don't open your mouth you are a favelado. You
could be connected to criminals... If the police gets here now, they will treat you well, when you say
you come from outside, they will treat you well, but with me it's going to be a problem, they will put
me to the wall, and when I begin to talk 'Do you work?', 'I work, here is my working card', 'Where do
you live?' 'I live there I work with moto-taxi'. When I begin to talk he sees that I am not the kind of
person that I might look like I am.

Me: What?
D: Exactly the problem of... that happens in the US. What happens in the US? In the US, if you are for-
eign, you have never had that joke here. You have it now because the people realised that the Brazili-
an hates the favela. People with money from Leblon, Ipanema, if they have money, they don't like
people living... they don't like the poor. This is the truth. And those that like the favela and that come

and visit are the gringos, you understand? Of course after the UPP it became an explosion. But, I will
tell you straight [laughs] you missed the best period. When here you didn't have this joke [the UPP]
it was much more free, you were more free to do everything.
Me: You know like... do you think that your relationships... the things you do with your friends inside
Vidigal and with your friends outside Vidigal, are they the same things, or are they different?
D: [interrupts the translator] I've got it already. So... I got an education, thanks to God, my parents
gave me a very good education. They worked a lot to be able to educate me. So I studied, I studied in
a middle-class school, a private school. And I was one of the few kids in school, probably the only
one that lived in a favela. Of course there were blacks, but not many in the private schools. My
friends always liked me because it was always very easy for me to make friends. But for example, I
had a friend that lived in Viera Souto, which was of the most expensive places in Rio de Janeiro. They
would tell me that I couldn't tell their parents that I lived in a favela, because their parents wouldn't
let me play with them any more. I never stopped telling that I lived here. I went to my friend's house,
in a study group, to do group projects for school. And a mother or father or whoever was taking care
of us that day, or someone working in the house would ask 'So, cool, where do you live?' 'I live in Vi-
digal', 'you live in Vidigal?' ' I do' 'aaah OK, you live in Vidigal. How is it there, with criminals, the
cops, your parents? How do you live?'. They always wanted to know about the parents. The ques-
tions they were asking, they wouldn't mind the answers: when I left their place, I would go back to
school and there was group work to do, I couldn't go to their place any more, their parents would
forbid me from going to the house because they thought I was going to steal something from the
house because I lived in a favela. But the fun thing is that today, the same group of people that speaks
bad about the favela, that talks badly about the favela, that says that only thieves and criminals live
in the favela as it was before, now loves the favela [spits on the ground].
Me: Have you experienced situations in which the locals maybe didn't like the presence of people
coming from the outside?
D: There was a case I'll tell you about now. It was in the middle of last year. Here this lady that live…
used to live in that house for 30 or so years, a lady that was already retired, and retired in Brazil
means a shit salary, to live she still had to work. She lived in a house that in the middle of the
80s-90s and beginning of 00s, she saw dead people in front of her house, people killed by police,
from different fractions, different gangs, enemy gangs. When the UPP got here, which was the time to
'no I will live in peace and won't see dead people in front of my house any more'. A foreigner comes
looking for a place to live, he asked someone that by coincidence was the owner of that house. 'I'm
looking for a place to rent. By myself, I pay R$ 1.500'. The woman that had lived there for 40 years
paid R$ 350 and she would always pay on time. The owner kicked her out to put the foreigner, be-
cause he would pay 1.500. 
Me: That's crazy…
D: And where did the lady go? I don't know…

Appendix

Me: What would they say about this? When you talk together...
D: What do you mean?
Me: when you talk to your friends...
D: What we are talking about here, for example, when I got to know Rosa, I talked to her about the
fact this was happening. She was: 'imagine it's going to be cool, it's not going to be so crazy any
more', and I said like 'Dude you are from Saño Paulo, not from Rio. You are coming here to live now'.
She was assaulted by a cop. This happens, has always happened. It always happens. I have been hu-
miliated by the police. In the afternoon, at 3pm, I was coming up from school and the cops ordered
to take my clothes off in the middle of the streets. I was naked in the middle of the street. With my
school clothes and materials with me. I was humiliated by the police. Do you understand?
Me: All this is very interesting, but I would like to move away from the police and the drug traffick-
ing now to get more into the relationship with foreigners. You said some of your friends are not
happy about all these foreigners coming. … Have you experienced any situation in which they
would...
D: [Interrupts] The thing is that... Like I was telling you. It's because of rent. I saw a note: 'I rent
house to foreigners only'. How can that happen? Now people are... their money are not worth any-
thing? Now only foreign money? How's that? It's a real estate speculation man, it is the biggest prob-
lem, in the communities with UPP. If you have UPP, what happens... why don't they go and live in
Complexo de Alemaño? Isn't it a favela as well? Why don't they go live in Jacareé? They also have UPP. 
Me: Why do you think they don't?
D: Why don't they? Because the South Zone is here. Got that?
Me: But if you talk about… like, I mean, now we are talking about foreigners come, buy the houses…
D: [Interrupts] Do you know Trancoso? In Bahíéa?
Me: No
D: It's a city in the south of Bahia. The place is beautiful. Many foreigners have started to discover it
and started buying. The local people that lived there are now all employed by the foreigners, who are
getting even richer. Because the city has lot of tourism. The tourism is heavy. They are all owners of
hotel, hostels, they are all foreigners. But the people that was born there, they get minimum wage,
and many are even exploited by owners. This will happen in Rio, in Vidigal. Vidigal will be the new
Santa Teresa, do you know Santa Teresa?
Me: [Nods]
D: It will be a Pelourinho [central neighbourhood in Salvador de Bahia]. In Pelourinho, if you see a
Bahiano [inhabitant of Bahia] there, you will see 5-6, the others are going to be foreigners. 
I saw things here you would think I am lying. But I am not. These things that I saw, bad things that
happened here… These are the people that have to be here getting the good things coming out of it.

Not the foreigner. Because, there will come World Cup, there will come the Olympics, there will be an
amount of foreigners here… Of course, Rio de Janeiro will enter in the city. The government is doing
things for people to leave. They leave and the foreigners come to live in the favela, come into the
favela. This is what I am against, I'm not against that the foreigner comes and see and get to know
this, I would like even like to know NY, Brooklyn, nowadays I don't know. Harlem for expample, with
the racial conflicts that they had. But in the end…
The interview is conducted in Portuguese with English translation.
5:02So I found a house of the kind I wanted, with a good price, and here is even some money left. That's
it, this hasn't so much to do with... there is people that are bothered by this invasion. Vidigal was al-
ways a quiet family place, without many parties till late, it was quiet. 
The interview is conducted in English.
5:42Everything I have from my old house was given to me by people I didn't know, who literally opened
their doors and gave me things out of their house. So we looked around to look for houses to rent
and we went through every alleyway and we met a lot of people and we'd say hello to everybody,
and literally never felt so welcome by a community. Times have changed now with the attitude to-
wards foreigners obviously because it was a bit of a novelty. Now there is a lot more.
I: I said 'Let's go and get some food then', 'cause they had given us the number to call the restaurant
in Vidigal to say that we should get them to deliver it. They didn't encourage you to go inside you
know? In fact they encouraged you to call and to get it delivered, which case it made my friends
more scared even to go inside. The first day we went out when we first arrived here, we went to
Ipanema, and we went into a bar and three people in half an hour told me that I should come and
live with them, because I was going to be… it was too dangerous, I was going to get killed in Vidigal.
Me: Brazilians? Who told you this...
I: Yeah, Brazilians who lived down there in Ipanema, so they don't understand the favela, and they
did never been in Vidigal and the media tells them that.

Me: So like the investors are also people coming from the outside?
I: Definitely, yeah, the most of them. I met yesterday a French who sold everything up in Paris to
make a restaurant in Vidigal, Karl who has Alto Vidigal is from Austria, and there has been all this
confusion about his place and somebody... Rolf was a German, a very rich German guy who tried to
steal the house. It's very high profile you know these things with foreigners and the money that is
coming in because they are the ones that who are gonna be able to aim it towards the tourist popula-
tion, that's what Vidigal is gonna go. But not just tourists, it has opened up to. It opened up to
Brazilians who are not from the favelas, which is a huge amount of people as well
Me: Are there many, like, Brazilians not coming from favelas now?
I: Coming in to...? Yeah
Me: Like that live in the rest of Rio and...
I: Yeah. There is a lot of them, yeah. All of them yeah, absolutely.
Me: Visiting or living?
I: Coming for parties, mainly. Parties is the main thing. A lot of them are coming to live as well, but
mainly is that kind of, yeah a lot of young professionals, artists... We have the theatre here so a lot of
actors. There is a lot of... yeah it's more of an arty scene, which I think it's cool for Vidigal. I'm enjoy-
ing it you know? There's parties and there is a nice crowd of people that are coming visiting Vidigal.
But... there is positives and negatives about all of it. And I don't think any of it necessarily is positive
or negative it's just different and not everybody really generally like change you know? So you just
have to... you know, very much anticipated it to be worse when it happened because the police were
there, it was a tense time we were all nervous you know? And now I think, I'm still totally happy. It's
still getting better and better for me so... yeah it's just interesting to see where it's come from and
where it's gonna go.
Me: What do you mean by foreigner community?
I: Well there is foreigners like you, me are here with Lisa and my friend Dominique is here, we might
go and meet Oscar later, and there is Lisa... I mean that didn't exist before, it was me and Mie and we
knew there was another American girl and we saw one guy from Portugal, we used to see him pass
by. And that was it. We didn't hear about anybody else. Now it's like, I don't know there is loads of
them, everywhere, this all living here. So that's cool. I helped and when they started to come I always
helped people to get rooms because people from here need help pay their rent potentially and they
might have a spare room they might want to rent out. So matching foreigners with local people was
cool as well to try to integrate them and it's beneficial on both.
Me: What kind of people come? It looks like an artist community...
I: Depends, well they don't come into here, this is a separate, we have had our parties here in the
past and we have invited people who are into art, but the Oficina de Jó is separate, we lock the door
when there is a party normally. Samba is very much loval people who like pagode. A very local atmo-
sphere. And then there is Lamparina it's all rich patrocinhos [upper class kids] from Ipanema.
Me: What was that?

158

50:04

52:56

Transcriptions

I: Patrocinhos?
Me: No, the kind of party you said.
I: Lamparina.
Me: OK, what is it?
I: There is a lot of, it's like party that has been going on for a long time, it's come off the theatre, it's
basically a party that brings people from Ipanema, and it always did. It's been before pacification.
Now Africa is a new party that wasn't there. I did miss the last one, it's supposed to be a fantastic
party, with a lot of music drumming, and I think it brought a new crowd, there is a new feeling of
Brazilian culture parties which I think is coming out Vidigal now. There is another one [incompre-
hensible name] on Sunday, that is not here, but that is going to be amazing as well. It's cool the
parties are cool, there is a big insurgence of artists you know? Artists, I mean we had, they were
filming here the other day, there was actors, and I mean, the people that pass through just my
house… it's ridiculous, like DJ's from the US and then it could be an actor who's famous. Literally
sometimes it's just like 20 people and I look around and I'm like 'You are all artists'! Like that's so
cool you know? It's a really nice hub of people and creative energies I think in Vidigal.
Me: I don't know like the last final note would be again on the changes we talked about. And you
were talking about the fact that loads of people are coming in and this is obviously going to change
the community because it's different people and there is going to be different relations between
people...
I: Definitely. I think the saddest thing is that a lot of people are gonna leave. And people say it's nat-
ural, and obviously they can, a lot of people would be able to sell the house and get a bigger house in
the wherever, but Vidigal is what it is because of those people and these new people are going to
make a new story I suppose. It's just change you know, I can really reflect that negative about it, I al-
ways feel a little bit negative about it because I don't like to see people leave, but it's going to be a
new story. But I do worry that it is going to be all this money coming in and then suddenly after the
World Cup and Olympics it's all gonna drop again. And then this is gonna be left in a kind of no man's
land. We'll see what happens, maybe not you know? Could be like it feels like [not understandable] it
to me I am in the middle of it, I am enjoying it, it's good if you are young, there is a good scene's time
parties and art and great things. Let's just see what happens… Watch this space! [laughs].

C.6 -  Hugo

The interview is conducted in English.
2:00I have been coming here for the past 8-9 years. And just to see friends and I did a bit of voluntary
work as well with Nós do Morro, the theatre company. I came but I've never stayed really, stayed and
lived really in favelas, for only in the past two years I've been here, you know?. Because I had to, you
know I had to. I was living, I had a house in Saquarema, so I was living in Saquarema and coming up

159

Appendix

to Rio now and then. And when I was coming to Rio I was coming to Vidigal, because all my friends
are from Vidigal, so I was coming to Vidigal, staying with them and coming back to Saquarema. And
after a while I needed to work, so I needed to come to Rio, because Saquarema is like a fishing village
so there is no work. And so I had to come to Rio, and I found a job in Leblon. And it was... you know
for me... 'Where am I gonna stay?' 'Where am I gonna …' , you know? 'Vidigal, obviously!'. It was next
to Leblon, and downstairs it's so expensive, you know Leblon, Copacabana, Ipanema is very, very ex-
pensive to rent a place, so for me it was yeah Vidigal...
5:38After that you know I came here, I stayed a bit in Saquarema and after that I had to work, 'cause you
know, money... I had to work. So I came here. It was good to be able to come to Vidigal, and this com-
munity is unbelievable. I love it. They are very, they are very together. It's a very difficult life, very
difficult, 'cause you know, most of the people here they sort of they've got minimum wage and that's
why they can't afford to live other places around the community.
H: I start to talk and I was like 'I have to introduce you to this really good friend of mine who's a pho-
tographer, he's amazing and bla bla bla, 'cause you are in production, you like to maybe to do some
fashion production involving the community, the favela, to some, you know... some great models with
the background the favela's background and bla bla bla bla and she had this idea of a project and bla
bla bla and said 'Oh yes, I have to meet and to involve people from community', get some good look-
ing girl from the community, the photographer from the community, make a party for the com-
munity and bla bla bla bla. And we start and we got this, we create first a team, a team of like... and
we start to just get, found a name called Gloss some of us thought because 'Oh Gloss, it's becoming so
gloss in the favela, gloss' and bla bla bla bla and so we got the name Gloss and we started to have a
little, some fun producing a few pictures and materials like this. I got to know Vanessa, and after that
she had this idea to do, to involve, to show what Brazil is and the mixture. Brazil's a big mixture of
people from all over the planet, you look Brazilian, I look Brazilian, anyone can look Brazilian really.
When you go from south to north of Brazil you've got a diversity of colours that is unbelievable. So
we were having a few evenings, talking about this. And Vanessa had this idea to just do an evento, I
don't know in English...
Me: A happening?
H: In Vidigal, 'I'm gonna call it Mistura Tropical', because Brazil it's tropical and it's a tropical mix,
you know? And we did a month of production, very intense, so intense. We got three bands, it was
just amazing. It was really really good.
Me: Where did you hold it here?
H: It was just after Nós do Morro theatre, there is a friend of us, he's an actor from Nós do Morro and
he has got a nice house with a big garden in the back and a huge stone in the garden, and with a pool.
So we emptied the pool, we put the DJ in the pool. It was completely insolit [unusual], you know, set.
It was just amazing. The bar on the big stone, a huge massive stone, the bar was there and it was like,
you know a band was suspending, it was higher up and it was a band. The first band was A Fan-
farada which is a band from Rio and they are all, it's a brass band, so they are all trumpet and trom-
bone, and they are 16, I think 16 of them, so imagine. And they do all covers of classic Brazilian mu-

29:27

sic and Cuban, because there is a mix, there is Cubans and Argentinians and Brazilians who play. It's
Fanfarada, the fanfare. And so this band, and after another band called Pietá which is a bossa nova
band and a friend of Vanessa she did... there is a program called The Voice Brazil. It's like people sing
they go, they do... this program, they sing on TV, they get picked up, the best ones. She was one of
them and so she came to sing classic Brazilian songs as well. So we did this big melting pot of like,
with the Fanfarada, with bossa nova, with this girl, who's an up and coming girl, singer, amazing
voice, big afro. It was great. And all this in between with poetry, interaction with art, people who re-
cite poetry and projection of Brazilian paintings and Brazilian, you know...
Me: How many people came?
H: We had about almost 400 people came, so it was really good, and all that through the, with the
different bands who did their own advertisement with their own public, with their own audience.
And through the internet, Facebook and we did a bit of as well, poster to put in the favelas, we put it
in the university, the PUC. We put it in a few places...
Me: What kind of people came?
H: It was, because we wanted to make as well, we tried to target more like... we tried to make an en-
contro. More like a meeting. Encontro of people who has ideas, artists, so it was like a mix of artists
from the community and people who are curious. Because it was on a Sunday and it is quite difficult
to get people out on a Sunday evening. People just go, Sunday they go to the beach half the day and
after that they go home. They don't do, you know all the … They just do a barbecue somewhere. So
we managed to get, to make this meeting of artists and people curious, curious people who want to
meet artists and exchange things and it really worked. It really worked. Because we had cushions
and stuff so people sitting and the DJ was playing some really lounge music, Brazilian lounge music.
And in between we had these band playing. It was more like in Santa Teresa there is one, Vanessa
she was a bit inspired, she went a few months before she went to Santa Teresa and they had a bit of
an evento like this, a bit like... it was on Sunday as well, it was more a jazzy sort of feel, with Brazilian
jazz, with different artists and they had open stage.
H: And now because it's probably a bit more sort of liveable, and not so noisy, there is no gangster
and you don't see any gun on the streets, before you could see guns everywhere. It's just like... it's a
lot more like civilized [laughs]. People won't be so scared to come and live in Vidigal. Before I mean, I
don't know if I would have come here if I wouldn't have come through a friend of mine from Vidigal
who introduced me. So you know people from Vidigal who introduced me through Vidigal. 'So come,
come over...'
Me: What did you expect?
H: Nothing. I didn't know what to expect really, I really didn't know. But when I came I was a bit
shocked, yeah the guns and the noise that really was what first shocked me. And after that you just,
you stay a few, after a few days you just get use to it.
Me: I interrupted you before, when you were saying that maybe you wouldn't have come here, if you
hadn't had a friend who introduced you... I don't know if you were finished with that part... 
H: Yeah, because it's what you heard from the outside, you know?... even though, you know? I was

161

57:59

1:01:16

Appendix

1:18:27

living in Brazil, but you know? All the Brazilians 'Wow! Are you going to...', when I decide to go to the
favelas 'Are you going to the favelas? Are you sure?'. You know? It was like big, a really big thing. I
didn't want to expect anything, I didn't want to you know... I just 'I'm going to go to try you know?
I'm with my friends and everyone is going to be safe. Everything is going to be safe. It's an adventure,
I'm here in Brazil' and after I found out that it's nice, it's rubbish. It's just, you know, it's they live ex-
actly, the people who live in the favelas, people live with the mafia, with... and learn to live with the
mafia, learn to live with this you know, these things. It's sort of normal people, they are not all gang-
sters, like most of the other people from Rio or from other places say, outside from the favela, you
know they say, when they mention it, it sounds like they are gangsters, they all wear guns. 
H: Now people are not so scared to go up the hill. And there is another party called Lamparina, have
you heard Lamparina? No?
Me: No, I haven't.
H: It's once a month and most of the people that go there they are all from Ipanema.
Me: Where is it?
H: Lamparina it's people from as well, actors and producers who do this once a month party and it's
a theme party, so there is DJ's who play sort of [unusual]Brazilian music and as well foreign music,
American, kind of a mix. And it's like open space. Where Ida lives there is a oficina, the garage, there
they empty the whole garage and it's there.
Me: You know when it is going to be the next time?
H: I can... Have you got Facebook?
Me: I tend to use it for work only, but…
H: OK, but I can, I've got your number now, I'll tell you next one. I'll tell you next one. And it's a good
party it's a really good party to go. People from the community organize this but most of the people
who go there they are people from Leblon.
Me: Brazilians or foreigners?
H: Brazilians, foreigners, there is a few foreigners as well, it's all word of mouth... 
Me: We were saying... I was thinking, who is it then that comes in when you say it costs 300.000 now,
while before it costed R$ 10.000 to buy an apartment down here, now it costs 320.000. What kind of
people move in? I also heard stories...
H: Most of people are people who can afford it. People who can afford it, so it's going to be… and
people who are, don't have any preconceito, don't have any... People are pretty alternative, people are
pretty urban. Enough money but they don't want to be... like me, I don't want to be living in Leblon,
Ipanema or Copacabana. Even if I could afford it, I don't think I'd be living there. I don't think I'd be
living there. Especially now that... it's still not as expensive as down there, so you've got a bit of an al-
ternative. 
And I don't think... they might have a bit of jealousy… I don't know if there is, because the fact, no, no

1:45:14

1:57:15

… I was thinking maybe the fact that you come to the community with your money and you spend
your money and you stay and you can afford a nice place, so that you can... invasion right, being a
bit... but no. I have a few friends who are 'Careful Hugo, because there is people who have olho
grande [big eyes]'. They come here and they see you managed to find this place here, you managed
to find this laje [rooftop] here and you have done it you know so well, you and your partner, and bla
bla bla, careful when you bring people over, who are, born here in the community, they see you here
you find this place they can be a bit 'Why not me? I have been for so long, why didn't I manage to get
this, a gringo came here and just snapped it from me'. It's not really that, but sometimes you can...
but, no never had any bad experiences in Vidigal. Never had, never got... and you see here everything
is open, there is no window, everything is open, and I've computer, I've got... never got anything
stolen.
Me: And do you think the presence of foreigners will change something?
H: Yes. I think it will
Me: That's a very clear answer. How do you imagine?
H: Because of the, for instance since I have been here I have been involved in so many things, pro-
jects within the community and most of them within the community, that is sort of influenced.
People see there is some gringo coming here and they do things, they do you know. That's what I
was saying with Ida. Ida who organised a few things and if we weren't there, it wouldn't have
happened. It wouldn't have happened. The Vidigaleria, the project we did... it's... they see this in a
way that 'Oh wow', that, you know if we can do they can do it as well. Sort of to influence the idea to
it's not impossible, you can do it with energy. You don't need money to do it, you just need the right
people, with the right attitude and right energy. And you can do a lot. In that aspect yes. When I go to
work I know all the people from the street, all the kids they know Fighter [Hugo's dog], they go
'Where is your dog? Where is Fighter?'. So they interact a lot with us as well and with my accent.
Sometimes they ask me words 'Oh how do you say that in French? How do you say that in French?'.
So you give a bit of yours. So I think it's not gonna change, but gradually, little by little I think it's …
it's part of it. We are... that is why it is so exciting to be here now. Because things are changing and
you can feel it in the air. I'm just, since I started here, I am so happy to be here, to be working in Rio
and here in Vidigal.
Me: When you say like you can feel it in the air, the vibe and this...
H: Yeah because it's this... there is an energy here. There's definitely something in the air, an energy. I
really feel, I don't know how to explain, I think something very personal maybe. The fact of being in
Vidigal and to have the privilege, this opportunity to be really in the community, completely mer-
ging, be in this group of people so talented and so special for me. That is just like... it helped me a lot
to just... yeah being in a foreign country and speaking a foreign language. It's not easy, you know?
And Brazil, you know Brazil is so different from Europe. Brazil is so different from Europe. So... I
think it's... for me I'm really grateful for them. Really really grateful. I have never, never... when I was
in London or Paris, I have never been so grateful. When I go to work, I go to work, imagine: I go
down the hill and I just walk along the promenade, along the sea up to the Posto 11 and I just go up

163

to the salon. But I walk all along the beach, and I'm just like, it's so stunning, and I am like 'Thank
you!'. I don't know who to thank because I'm not… Thank you, I don't know who but thank you for
all this. And I've never done this before, I never thank things, the universe. I never thank, to give me
this opportunity to be here, to do what I really like to do, and even though, you know? Sometime it's
hard, sometime a moment is really difficult, but the good moment make for the bad one. [Laughs].
The interview is conducted in English.
8:40Then I came back here and I was travelling a lot back and forth also, so I didn't have time to settle,
but then like, when it was around July I was back in Brazil for good. I travelled another time like this
time to Europe, the US and Haiti for working, and I was like 'Yeah, I am going back to Vidigal'. So I
moved back here and then like my perception of things changed completely. I think the major learn-
ing if you live in a place like this is that you realise that there are good and bad people everywhere.
Because a big problem of people from outside the favela, Brazilian people and foreigners that come
here, even I had this problem 'Oh, poor people in the favelas, everybody is so nice', you know? And
'Bla bla bla', but it's fucking assholes, there are great people, there are opportunists, there are gener-
ous people. And I really realised that understanding that and treating everybody like you treat
everybody in your house, is really a true sign of respect, it's like true respect towards these people. 
Me: When they say these things, they are talking about these specific houses or something else?
J: Yes, it is. And around here too you know? But I don't know, let's see what's going to happen. I know
it's a beautiful place, has a lot of visibility, everybody wants to be in Rio the next three years, every-
body wants to do something in the favelas, do good for themselves, and what concerns is me that,
this sane way there are the gringos and even Brazilians that come here just to have the favela life and
don't engage. All these people invest here and just getting out of it and not putting anything for the
people that are originally from here. My hope is that Vidigal has a really strong activist history, dur-
ing the dictatorship the military wanted to build a big headquarters here and to kick out a lot of
people, but people laid down in the streets in the bottom and like 'Fuck this shit, I'm not gonna let
this to our house' and they succeeded you know? With some help of the Catholic Church. But like...
[comments on the people passing by] Let's see what's going to happen, it's going to be tough. But I
think people here begin... my goal is that in 10-15 years, even though I'm sure there is going to be
gentrification, at least 60% of the community is still from Vidigal, or at the worst case scenario 50%.
But I know that there is a huge chance that in 10 years it might be that only 40% of the original com-
munity of this place lives here.
The other thing, I think there is community, is that when people move from this like social capital,

32:02

1:01:22

this bonding of social capital to bridging social capital. Like for example: 'Oh, what's my neighbour
doing? How is he doing? Does he need help? How is my other neighbour doing? Is she fine? She had
a kid that needs something, can I carry the stuff for her when she is coming from the grocery store?'
and I think this happens a lot  more here. And that's really true. And also I think because it's so
dense, people have no privacy. So everybody know about everybody's lives. Then I'm like, sometimes
it's for good sometimes it's for bad. But everybody is connected. The fact of space really influences
how people behave and shit. And the fact because they didn't have police for so long that they had to
take care of each other. Some social [coexistence]. They get somebody, a neighbour, [stealing] like a
cement bag for somebody. Like call the neighbours, get together and kick his ass. Because that's the
protection the community create, so yes there is a really strong sense of community. Most of it, it's
good, some of it is bad, but still a different thing Ipanema, Leblon and like the US or Europe.
Me: But do you think then that the clienteèle of these places is not necessarily the favelados but
someone else, or...?
J: Yes yes, it's people from outside. It's like in Rocinha they have this baile funk called The favoritos,
everybody 'Yeah, let's go to baile in the favela!'. You get there and to get in it's R$ 120. Who the fuck
from the favela is going to be there? So it's all for these playboys and these patrocinhos [upper class
kids] to go and 'Yeah I was partying at the baile in the favela, you know? I'm bad ass', bunch of fuck-
ing losers you know?
Me: Getting back to your social network in a way, would you say that you do different things with
your friends from here and your friends from the outside?
J: In Rio?
Me: Yes, like friends from Vidigal and friends from not Vidigal. Now obviously you said many of your
friends here are like a bit older people...
J: [interrupts] Yes it's fine man, because I live in a situation where like my friends from outside they
know my work, they know what I do. Modestly, I don't wanna sound like an asshole, but like my
work has been published many places, I've been in the Financial Times, TV Globo, O Globo, Estadaño
[Brazilian media] this fucking shit, but here nobody knows. And I don't want anybody to know, be-
cause that is giving me a lot of freedom to learn and then to experience the place. So I could say the
difference is my friends from outside they know all my life trip is here and they know what happens
here, even though they don't understand it really, because they are not in here. And the people here,
I leave a lot of things out and live outside and I behave in a different way of course because the rules
are different here, but they don't have an idea about who I am or what I do.
The interview is conducted in Portuguese.
Me: This is interesting as well, and I would also like to say, before we continue, that you should feel
free to speak as you like. I'm not going to get offended if you talk badly about foreigners, for my re-

search it is interesting. In truth I have spoken to people here that say 'It's good, culturally, economic-
ally, it's going to improve for us', but sometimes I thought that people didn't want to speak their
minds because I am foreign too, so just say the truth, it's not going to be a problem for me.
J: [laughs] Yes because this is what I mean. I have several foreign friends, most of the foreigners that
I know are researchers or doctors of some kind, many of them prefer to live in the pista [synonym-
ous of asfalto, defines the richer neighbourhoods around the favela] because of this: they came to me
and told me, a German friend, who's no longer here in Rio, she went back to finish her studies. She
said 'Hey Julio, when I got to Rio several people told me 'I live in a favela and it's cool', but I think our
presence is very bad for you, so I prefer to pay. My university gave me some money and I will use this
money in a place that I can afford outside the favela. Why? Because if I come and pay less I will have
money left from the university, but in return you will pay more than what you pay. I will stay here
2-3-6 months and [what about] you, that will stay here?'.
J: I made a project that was about Vidigal, the history from fishing village to fashion favela. No one
knows Mr. Armando, a person who helped to found the Association or Residents, who was there,
who fought for this and went here and there to let people build. These people are getting sad, be-
cause many things don't make sense to them anymore. You talk about a favela which is what? Well,
great, Vidigal is only pretty aesthetically, so if I look at it from Ipanema I see a favela on the top of a
pretty mount. Cool, that's it. But in relation about education and the real culture, do people have
any? Because at 7-8 at night it is all closed, there is no culture house, there is no space where the
young people can meet and talk. Is the arrival of tourists improving this in any way? No, the oppos-
ite. It's bringing only fear. I have met people, and I am not only talking about the foreigners, also the
relation with the police, the UPP didn't bring the improvement that it said it would be bring. People
know that there is still selling drugs, people know that there are people killing, in Rocinha 2-3
people a day die, stabbed to death.
Me: Stabbed, what does it mean [asking for clarification over a Portuguese word]
J: With a knife.
Me: OK.
J: There is no control. The police is not getting any closer to the people, the police don't care, is not
interested in the community. It doesn't dialogue to the community, it wants to be a whole. Then this
comes, in the weekend too, Vidigal is dead, empty, there is nothing. People want to sell a place that is
vibrant in beauty and in culture, but there is nothing!
J: Despite the fact that there are many foreigners, when I counted last time there were 220 foreign
resident.
Me: 220? Residing here?
J: Residents.
Me: Long time or short time residents?
J: Both long time and short time. I counted both hostels and houses. This was some time ago, it was
already two months ago. I don't know now, but now you surely have more. It's this... If you put this
between 40-50.000 people, these foreigners in Vidigal. It's not very right, 220 for 40-50.000... it's a

very big difference.
Me: Then in reality the number of foreigners is not very big, but the impact is big?
J: It's huge, it's huge. It's like... I am 1.85m high, but a virus is microscopic. The virus of the flu is mi-
croscopic, still it can kill me. Imagine, for as small as it is, it's very violent.
J:  At the same time the cultural things emerged, the cultural way. This, how can I say it, it made
people even more slow: they developed the cultural side but forgot the human side. There appeared
several that wanted to take advantage of it, people that wanted to sell an image of Vidigal in a way
while the reality was another. There was a new rhythm of the people … 
Me: When did this happen?
J: In the beginning of the 1990s until the end of the 1990s it was like this. And they were selling this
image. Vidigal is cultural, but, well great, cultural for whom? What type of culture?
J: What they do, the Brazilian students or the foreign ones, is to bring a solution to the people here
that, first, they don't ask the residents if they need it, they don't ask if the people want it, they don't
ask what is cultural or economic or financial impact that it will have on the people. They bring these
things and say 'This is good, because it worked out there'
Me: Do you have examples about that?
J: Uh... [expresses his concern about making names] […] Someone might bring an example 'Uh, this
say worked in Nicaragua', but Nicaragua has different needs than here. 'Uh this was cool in Oxford' -
fine, but Oxford is different from here. It's different things, like the rhythm in New York is different
from the rhythm in Rio de Janeiro. When I talk about Rio de Janeiro I'm excluding the favelas, only
the formal city. You can't compare the two things. My way of thinking is different from my neigh-
bour's. This is what people don't understand. People want to push a ready solution, put it in people's
heads and say 'This is right, this will work'.
The interview is conducted in English.
Me: So you were saying you went for the view.
K: I was like let's go up there and let's have a look and we were driving up with the car and I was like
'Wow it's a long way!'. And then we came up here and I was thinking already 'OK, this house, he
wants to show me, I'm not really interested any more because it's just way up here'. So I was like 'OK
whatever, let's have a look quick and let's pretend, nice, thank a lot man and ciao'. So then we arrived
here and then we went down the stairs and when I saw the view I was like 'Wow! Wow! Wow! That's
fucking crazy', I never saw a picture before of this view. Now everybody knows the picture already.

Like on Facebook, many people have that on the background, I see it once in a while, when people
see this view now 'Ah yes Vidigal, yes I have been there for a party'. But when I came first time here, I
had no clue, nobody saw this view before, and the others that came the first time with me they were
like 'What, wowowow'.
Me: When was that?
K: 2009.
Me: Have you ever been confronted directly with someone expressing this jealousy somehow, like
verbally, physically, or by just the attitude?
K: Well I hear constantly some... no I hear only like in effect when I am completely defence, like com-
pletely cool with the people then they basically say it, otherwise they would just say 'We are better,
we are stronger, we are cool, we are Brazilians', and they are putting their macho thing on, but if you
are cool with them, so like 'Yeah but you know over in Europe everything is better'. They think
everything is better there. It's not like that, it's a little bit like a dream what they are living:
'Everything is better there, if you have good education
Me: Like there in Europe?
K: Yes yes 'Everything works better, you guys are more educated'. I heard it like many times, but usu-
ally in a thing when they are open, that was the thing, they want to go there, that's their dream, and
then, of course they see the gringo is here and go nanana and then they feel like mhmhmh [mimes
aggressive attitude] and then it becomes this, it's a different culture you know?
Me: Did this happen with people working that you had to kick out and they wouldn't go or...?
K: I kind of felt that it was close by sometimes you know? That you lose the power. I know it only
from working with people, like bricklayers, you pay them and they show up and I go there and I'm
like 'Look, I paid you, come here'. But in the end, it's their... It's better you get somebody from the out-
side, that you at least stay in power control, because here you lose it and then they do whatever they
want.
Me: And what kind of people come now?
K: Well, it's very very different. There is people from the favelas, the cool people from the favelas
who have good taste. What you don't have is I'd say the poor people, the people who live in the
streets, like I call them the vagabundos [tramps], of course they don't... they don't know what this
music you know. Then you have foreigners, mainly who live here in Rio, because tourists, they don't
know about this venue, it needs a while to get to know while it's not like a mainstream venue. But
tourists come here sometimes and knows a party and they go. Of course we have tourists here as
well. But most of the foreigners that are here are not really tourists. But you have a lot of foreigners
because they like this kind of... it's open air, the view, that kind of music... it's hard to find it in Rio
sometimes. Then you have people from all over the neighbourhoods, from Niteroy, from Barra da
Tijuca, Paulistas [inhabitants of Saño Paulo], more and more Paulistas get to know it.

I think the education level of Rio is basically changing because of this movement of the mix, of the in-
tercultural mix actually right now. That's definitely changing. And that's good for some people but
not good for some other people. That's the difference. Because some people who own houses in Vi-
digal, they are happy. Prices go up, they can maybe sell some day and they can buy in the north-east,
where they come from, or they can stay here and have a good life. But any of the other people they
don't have a house, they just have a barraca [shack], or whatever it's not really theirs, they don't
have a job, they do drugs, I mean... prices go up and they have no chance to survive any more and
that's a problem. And they will tell you [not understandable] right there, put it like 'Yeah it's because
of you gringos!'. So it's like you destroy his life because of gringos, wait, but what's his life? Put it to...
I was thinking about that a lot you know? Like: I'm responsible now for that? But I mean you always
have the two sides, some like some not.
Me: I guess it's difficult to notice, but on the other side, do you have the feeling that people mingle
even if they come from different backgrounds, different classes, some are favelados, some come from
Ipanema, some come from the US, or do they... like sort of there is a bunch a  favlelados that comes in
and sort of hangs out all together and don't really have interaction with the others...
K: No well no. On the party no, usually more crowded and it's getting mixed up. Of course you stay
with your friends, but it's no... I wouldn't say like that, you would not have the feeling like that. It's
like you stay with your friends and ta-ta-ta.
Me: So you don't have a feeling that there are like different corners?
K: No no no, I never... if somebody tells me that I would be surprised, but I would not say that.
The interview is conducted in English.
Me: So here you found that cultural level that you were missing in the rest of the city?
L: Yeah, yeah.
Me: As in... ?
L: Neighbour that know each other, there is a sense of community, whether it's always good or bad,
the fact that all your neighbours know everything about you, it's you know, dependable, but I just
thought that it was more welcoming. I felt like why go live down there in the city if I can go live in
New York or Chicago or San Francisco, other than it being by the beach. To me... I'm not seeing that
much of a difference in city terms. Like the neighbours don't know each other, you know? [Gets in-
terrupted by the bar owner] and you know music, the street parties that were going on here, these
were kind of fun, fun things, activities to do, free things to do for people who lives here. As opposed

to down there in comparison to down there everything is so expensive.
Me: I am very much into people's anecdotes, small stories... now you were saying these things about
not really genuine friendships, more people that want to be able to say 'Hey, I have friend who is a
gringo', do you have any stories or conversations or things that could exemplify that?
L: Well... Not specifically anything I can deliver right now. A lot of times, I don't know if it is good or
bad, but as my husband is a local and he comes from Rocinha, I've often been introduced to friends,
and even sometimes then he is like 'Not OK, I know them, I know what they are doing, I am not let
them do that to you'. So a lot of times, it's been stopped right in the middle, I don't know if it would
have happened or not, but I like to think that he has my best interest in mind. He's looking out. And I
mean even my other gringo friends that here and stuff, like... for example I have friends here that
have a lot more connections and a lot more social networking than I do, I walk around with them
and they know everybody, because they talk to everybody. But a lot of times they don't know who I
am, and if I am by myself they don't think I can understand them and I hear them talk bad about my
friends, call them piranhas negative expression for a woman that is together with many men], these
things, and I am just appalled because it's just so two-faced. So these kinds of experiences have led
me to feel like...even if it feels like super-genuine friendliness, as I soon as I turn around, they are
making these comments that... I don't really care to have said about me.
Me: And the parties that here now, are like, too expensive, or they are different, or...?
L: I think they are too expensive. I know that there is the samba down in Vidigal for R$ 5 on Sunday,
which is pretty cool, and on Saturday night it's free down on the plaza, which is pretty cool and lots
of people go to that, but these parties like Digital Dubs, and I don't know, Morro Electrico [sic], I don't
think they are in the right place, I think it's exploitive.
Me: So it's a different crowd going there?
L: Oh yeah, it's nobody from here, they can't afford it. Everyone from, ah sure maybe some people
from here, but it's very rare. It's busloads of kids from Leblon and Ipanema, so that they can say they
went to the favela.
I just think there are a lot more culturally rich places in the world than Rio. Many people argue with
me, of course, I just don't really feel this is my niche in the world to be. That is why ultimately I want
to go outside. But something that, but it influences my opinion about not wanting to be here inside
the favela is the fact that it's so full of foreigners, and it's not just any foreigners. It's like there is this
weird vibe I get from foreigners who are here. Since the beginning, since I have been here, any other
foreigner that sees me, not any, but the most, 90% of them, look at me as if like they own the rights
to be here and who am I? Like they were first. I think that's bizarre. 'You were not here first. These
other people were here first, you would have never been here first'. Doesn't make sense there is a lot
of snottiness among foreigners about being in the favela. 'Oh yeah I know, I've been here this long,
and I know more. Just weird.

There is quite a few people who have this idea that they wanna sell, a lot of them want to go back to
the north of Brazil with the money they will make here, and I don't blame them, it makes sense.
People who want to sell their house and continue to live in Rio, that doesn't' make sense to me, be-
cause what are you gonna do with R$ 80.000 in Rio. Other than move to another favela or put down
a down payment on something. But if you are moving back to the north of Brazil, I don't blame
people for taking the opportunity to make their buck, this is the time to do it. So I have a friend, the
first house that I lived at, someone offered, I forget how much, but they offered for his house, but he
said no, he would never leave.
The interview is conducted in Portuguese with English translation.
Me: Could you give an example of how much rent would be and how much rent would be and how
much the salary would be?
A: The salary was between R$ 400-500 and rent was R$ 400. Now it went up to R$ 1000. Any place
around here, any small room. When I say it changed the profile, it's people that earned down there,
like a family that has an income of R$ 7.000, but a family with R$ 7.000 can't live in Leblon, it's too
expensive. So what's their vision? Their vision is that 'OK the violence is gone on the morro, I go and
live up there, no problem'. 
These people will begin to live here. They will begin to buy. Because those that live down there and
that have money, that obviously has money will buy… If they end up buying, they will buy ten shacks,
these houses that we call shacks because this is our culture: shacks, and make a villa. So probably iis
going to be a remoção branca [literally white removal, also used as the Portuguese translation for
gentrification], that is what is called.
The government has interests here, investors have interests in here. We have to watch out because
as you can't remove the whole favela from one day to the next, what do they do? They come in, it's
like if they were contaminating us. Probably some of the favelas in the South Zone won't exist in
40-50 years.

Me: What I am asking is if you see something happening now, which is changing the habits and the
culture of the people here.
A: What is happening inside in the community is that we have parties that are going in Europe that
are going on here now, with new musical rhythms. We hadn't had samba here for many years, now
it's coming back. What else do they have that I could tell you about?
For example, as there are many immigrants from the north-east, some of our commemorations… OK
I think it's like this: culturally I think it's going this way, with time the culture, some things are going
to stop existing, and this is natural with new generations or the adults don't pass these things to the
younger ones. When you lose a bit of identity what happens? It is difficult to get it back, because you
don't have old-timers or people that want to do something about it. I hope that now with this pacific-
ation thing, people will manage to keep things. For instance samba is more intense now, some folk-
loric parties are coming back. This is us that need to do this, it can be the Association or other NGO's
that are present here. So what we are trying to do is recovering cultural identity towards the future.
Me: Yes, but… Isn't this, in a way, make this process even harder to combat? I mean, if the prices
keep going up, isn't it gonna be even worse? Isn't it going to worsen the situation?
A: Imagine that you have a businessman trying to buy something here, they will not try to buy a little
house. I think it's like this: I think that when there is money there is no resistance, because the needs
of people here are very big. You understand? So it's very easy for you to buy. And there is no way out
of it man, time will tell.
Me: [Clarifying the question with my translator] He said sometimes people come here and they sug-
gest them to sell not for 100.000 but for 300.000 because then they can buy something new. I am
asking if there is like a story of someone... something that can exemplify the situation.
A: [After listening to the translation] Yes, you know what happens? Normally people get through ne-
gotiations, because, when it started… there is a story of a gringo here [lowers his voice] in the time
of trafficking, that started buying stuff, and starting from this moment, people started charging
more. And then since things got better, prices got even higher. And with that information, people
started buying things more expensive. I think it's the law of demand and supply.
Me: It's interesting that, I mean there are so many different types of housing. People owning the
ground, people paying taxes, people that just built their things out of nothing, big buildings, but it's
still the same community, right?
A: Vidigal is only one, there are different areas, like areas with people that are better off, of course
those that have more money live in better conditions. It's like this.

The interview is conducted in English.
Me: You said you got this possibility of buying a house here, how did that happen?
P: How did that happen? I had little money saved and wanted, I was thinking, I wasn't really
bothered to do anything in France. I've travelled, for 10 years I haven't spent the winter in France, so
I have been travelling quite a lot. I like many places around the world, Africa, Jamaica or pacific is-
lands. But Brazil was the place I felt I could feel home. And so for years I was looking for something
to buy more in the countryside. But I desisted as it was a bit far from everything. And I just thought
'What the hell I am going to come to Brazil to finally go in a very empty place?' And I am living in
south of France in very quiet place already. So I desisted, but then friends of friends and stuff make
that I discovered Vidigal. It was not pacified at the time. So it was full of incertitude. It was totally a
gamble. First time I get in the favela I really liked it. I had never been to a favela before I went to Vi-
digal. I knew Brazil quite a lot already, like I have travelled for few years in Brazil, but I found in Rio
all of Brazil concentrated. In Vidigal it is pretty much like the countryside.
Me: So it's a bit less the big city and bit more...
P: Yes, because if it was Leblon or Ipanema I wouldn't have bothered to come here really. It's too
much like Europe or America.
Me: Can I ask you what your offer was, what their offer was, and what you ended up paying?
P: First of all we did not make any offer, they made an offer, it was R$ 100.000, which was for the
time a hell of a lot. The people around, the neighbours said the house was worth 30-40.000 maxim-
um, but we finally bought it for 70.000. We knew it was a lot more then it was worth, but we knew
also that it was an amazing place. The potential we saw. Like the people didn't open windows on the
view and stuff, they did not give a shit. They were basically quite poor people and old, with their
child had already bought a few other houses in the favela, and they staying on the top, and they were
actually quite happy to sell, because the lady could hardly not walk the stairs no more
Me: Ah OK, so they needed to find a place more accessible...
P: Yeah. But we saw when we came the dollars in their eyes, because we were gringos obviously, and
they wouldn't have imagined that they could sell the house so expensive. So in a way we have been
fair and it is good, because we did not [steal] the house, we really paid it, but on the other way we
made the price go ppssstt go higher you know? As all the neighbours saw 'Ah we can also sell the
house really expensive' they wasn't expecting that you know?
Me: Were there others that then like tried to sell to gingos because of that?
P: Yes.
Me: OK, so they would like experience what you had done and then go 'Uuuhh, I can also sell'...
P: Yes and also one neighbour started to offer a house nearby, for a ridiculous price, to me yes, but
we don't want it because first we had no money to buy another house and also we wanted just this

house because [of the location], which was very quiet, nice.
Me: Do you find there is a difference between Vidigal and the rest, or…?
P: Not so much, although that in the favela, as we are foreigners, some people think, some people,
not everybody, some people don't give a shit, but some people, a few people think that we are full of
money and bla bla, and get quite jealous. They try basically, they often see on the short terms.
Someone is going to work for you, I have experience with builders and instead of thinking on the
long term, we tell a few builders: 'You can work for us for a few years and we pay good money', but
they won't, they just want a lot of money in the short term.
Me: What do you think is… what do you like of this place?
P: The fact that I don't feel in a city, I feel in a little village really, on the top. What I like is the con-
trast, pretty much. The contrast of the people from Vidigal, the community, I don't understand it all, I
still have to learn a lot about them, and the contrast about all the foreigners, the contrast about the
Zona Sul nearby, which is totally another world. I like the contrast. That's what I like in Brazil in gen-
eral and that's what I like in Vidigal, that's what I like in Rio.
Me: Your relationships in Vidigal, who are your friends?
P: Who are my friends, really... I know a lot of people from Vidigal, but most of my friends are people,
are either foreigners or Brazilians from abroad Vidigal. Friends. Then I know people, there are a lot
of people I know, but proper friends… Originally from the community I haven't got.
P: One reason I came here is that i like the place the way it is, you know. I don't want it to change so
much. One month ago I met a lady, a French, this one I told you, she is making a restaurant. And she
started to say to me 'Oh, after three months here I started to have a depression, because it's so filthy,
and my neighbour puts music all the day, I can't stand it, I want her to stop and bla bla'. I couldn't
stand that. I just told her: 'Why the hell are you coming here?', you know what I mean?. Like, if you
can't stand it, please don't come, because... I was straight with her: I don't want to be like that, to
do… come to a place because I like it the way it is and then make it change because of the stuff I don't
like. I want to change it, that's a trap and that is what happened in many places, and that is what is
dangerous for Vidigal. Because otherwise it is going to become like Ipanema, quickly.
Me: He [I point to his friend sitting nearby] was saying it's gonna become Beverly Hills
P: Yeah it's a big [fear] many people think that. I doubt it will become like Beverly Hills. I think it's
becoming more expensive, more expensive that's obvious and if it carries on like that... and it's
gonna become more like Santa Teresa. More lively. The thing of Vidigal and the thing of the favela is
that it's full of young people, and even foreigners which come there, most of the people are quite ori-
ginal, I think. They like parties, they like noise, they like the originality. I hope and I think it's not go-

ing to become Beverly Hills. But I don't think so, I think it's going to change obviously, everywhere it
is changing and especially here it's happening quickly because it opens from one day to the other,
but it's a big place, I mean, you cannot remove how many people, 50.000?
P: I think really, we are, it's safer for the favela, foreigners than rich people from Brazil.
Me: What do you mean by safer?
P: Safer in the way that we foreigners I think don't want to change the favela so much, and people
from the rich society from Brazil, who are investing in the favela, they do want to change the favela.
When I talk with them they really see people from the favela uncultivated people, and like poor
people and uninteresting and dirty place to go, and they really want to change the place. Rather than
us foreigners, for us it's exotic, it is part of what we like here. Because it's different from where we
live. And that is a big difference, in a way I think that, maybe I am wrong, totally wrong, this is my
own opinion, I think that we can protect a bit Vidigal, that if more foreigners would buy than people
from the Zona Sul.
The interview is conducted in Portuguese.
7:27The real estate speculation arrived very strongly, got to increase real estate values up to 400%. It's a
considerable increase. A house you could have bought 4 years ago for 20.000, today you buy for
80.000. It's crazy to think about it. Because Vidigal already had a process of removals in the 70s and
80s. The bulldozers were here on the Niemayer to kick the whole world out and transform this place
in something else. Luxury aparment blocks, maybe an extension of Alto Leblon. Damn! And people
resisted, they resisted in here! What is happening today is a silent removal. People are getting sub-
stituted. They can't afford to live here, it's expensive, the rent is high but the salary didn't grow.
R: This is something the UPP took with it when it came in. While taking some good things, services,
like a small thing, but for me it's a big difference: you take a taxi, and you say... you don't have to ask
beforehand 'Hey! Do you take me up there in Vidigal?' and they didn't take people in here. You could
take ten taxis and not one would say yes. 
Me: They didn't want to come up or…?
R: They didn't want to come up. They didn't want to come up the morro. Now you don't have that

problem. You get in the taxi and say 'Vidigal'. The taxi driver know it's pacified and there are no
criminals, so he can drive down alone in safety. It's good things, small things but good things. It's a
constraint you don't have any more.
Me: Now you were talking about the fact that in the last two years people here had to change their
lifestyle as well. Because the UPP arrived and brought with it its way of living and of thinking the
favela. Do you have examples of these things?
R: [Answers right away, almost before my question is finished] Parties. The parties. The parties. The
small events for the community. Sure you need to have safety and many things. But the attractive-
ness of the favela, of the morro, has always been this way of living more bohemian, more relaxed,
more chilled. You would throw a party without worrying about the neighbours because they would
come to your party as well. These things. So this shock of order, of order of silence, where you have
to turn the radio down because it bothers the neighbours, this is a cultural shock. It's a shock. Back
in the day I would try a party here, put a sound system, and would know that my neighbour wouldn't
have a problem with that. Now I have to give notice to the UPP and do whatever. 
Me: This was also a very good examples of how things changed. Do you have others that were not
about this specific party?
R: Yes, yes, there are other examples. Especially at the beginning. At the entrance of the favela there
are famous parties, the Lamparina. I don't know what. The first time of Lamaprina or whatever it
was, there was a confrontation. Police invaded the party, took Red Bulls and drinks. This happens a
lot, you need to find an agreement. They come to the party, they see irregularities, but you can
please them, you can give them a Red Bull or something, so that they stay quiet. So you keep rolling
and they are happy. It's a way that both sides find but it's not the right away: you don't need author-
ization from the police to continue your life. 
Me: I imagine that due to your work you know a lot of people that come here from the outside.
People told me that after the arrival of the UPP, more people than before began coming to Vidigal.
Gringos but also Cariocas that didn't want to come here before.
R: But they come here in a different way. I have been in Nós do Morro 13 years. The people that came
up here, that had the courage to come, the supposed to courage, they always came up in a more in-
teractive way. They wanted to know, they had a bit of the curiosity you have, were curious about
hearing how it was, see things and interacting and feel it and help and talking with people for real.
What happens now is almost a safari. People come here to see, come here to see 'how do they live?'.
'There is a rooftop, there is an open-air sewage'. The profile of the visitors of the morro changed a
lot. I'll give you an example: you always had famous people coming up here because of the Nós do
Morro. Many of them. You would see them sitting at the corner bar drinking beer and talking to

people, interacting. Now what happens? A party on the roof in Rua 3, there is a van down at the bus
stop waiting for people coming for the party. People arrive down there, get in the van, get to the
party, they stay on the roof, look at the view and the sea, it's all beautiful and they post it on Face-
book. When the party is over, they get in the van and they are left in the Niemayer. They are in a
bubble. There is no interaction, because to these parties does people go? The community doesn't
participate, because it's expensive. But these people come to try different sensations. A party on a
rooftop in a favela! The profile of the people that come to the morro changed. There is no interaction.
They don't come to exchange, they come to observe. And sometimes this observation offends us. I
think it's annoying when people get here, foreigners or not they come here and stay in their bubble
on the roof, and then they talk about “Wow there was a party there in the favela... so cool” I don't
know what. But they don't know what it is.
Me: The question was about the fact that there are many that live here too. Gringos, Brazilians, that
not only come as in a safari, but buy houses. This interests me as well, because in the first days I was
here I noticed that there are many people living here but there is not so much interaction with Vi-
digal's residents. Gringos live among gringos.
R: Between residents and foreigners?
Me: Yes, was it a wrong impression? Do you know foreigners living here for example?
R: I don't. Not even one. Not even one. They must live up there, someone must interact with them. I
didn't. I have to be honest Nicola, I don't see this as a good thing man. How really don't see it as a
good thing. How can I say? It's what I said before. The more people from the outside come here, the
more people from here have to go out there. Do you understand? It's not a sad thing for me to see
people from the outside living here. This place is damn beautiful. It's damn beautiful! What disturbs
me is that people from here need to leave. This is what is sad for me.
Me: We were talking about the fact that your sister left Vidigal because it became more expensive.
This is very interesting, do you also talk with friends or neighbours about this?
R: I do.
Me: And what would you say about it?
R: Pretty much what I think man. I don't know if it is because I talk to people that are like me and
that end up having my same opinion, but the majority of the people that I talk to think the same.
They say it's getting very expensive, that the arrival of foreigners is getting worse. That it ends up
being a silent removal. A disappropriation of the place from the people of this place. The profile of
people in Vidigal nowadays has changed a lot. I have already seen this, people from other communit-
ies talking about the fact that this is the Beverly Hills of Rio de Janeiro when it comes to favelas.
Me: What is interesting is that when I asked these people if the new foreigners they said they didn't.

They talk about the cultural exchange, so I would ask: 'Do you know any foreigner?', 'No, not yet'.
R: It's the idea that it would be good. I haven't met any foreigner yet. I have seen many in the streets,
but to get to know them, to exchange ideas, to invite them here at home and talk... zero. Zero interac-
tion, for me.
Me: Yes I understand. And where is it that you have seen foreigners in the streets? Are there special
places or…?
R: The end of parties. When they really try to interact. I guess they… The gringo, the foreigner, ends
up having an idea of this place that is very poor, that it is a place in need, and these things. I think
when he gets here, and doesn't find this scenario, he finds something which is not what he imagined
or what he has been sold, I think he is shocked, but at the same time he wants to find what they had
sold him. So I think that when the foreigner comes here, they go after this side more… It can be a
trip, it can be crazy from my side, but I think they go more after the underworld, you know? They
want to interact with moto-taxis, want to interact with the poorest part, want to interact with the
favela that has five kids. I think it's this part of the favela... this part. My house, I think it doesn't in-
terest many foreigners you know, I think he is more interested by this other part, the part they sold
to him. It ends up being his personal search.
Me: A question about the film 5x favela, what do you think is the most interesting thing you think
there is in the film about Vidigal? In the part about Vidigal?
R: About Vidigal? Have you seen it already?
Me: No, not yet.
R: I can give you one [gets up to fetch a DVD] So there is an episode in Vidigal, that is called 'Turn the
light on'. It's a Christmas story. At Christmas the favela is without light. The guy from the electricity
company comes, and not to leave the people without light on Christmas, he makes an illegal connec-
tion to the network. But even if he does this, the community gets together and doesn't allow him to
leave, until the light comes back, in order not to have to spend Christmas in the dark. The scenario is
the other side of the favela [the Catorze], the area with alleys, where people are more united. They
get together not to let him leave. The union of Vidigal is represented in that. 
Me: Did this happen for real?
R: Yes, it did.
The interview is conducted in Portuguese with English translation.
R: But now I remember, the first day I came to Vidigal in February 2008, I got the van in the centre
and asked the charger, a woman, 'Does this go to Vidigal?'. She looked at me like that and made a
cross sign, saying 'Oh my god'. And I said 'What? Oh my God? Oh, now what? I'm already here, let's
go!'. During the trip I was thinking 'What was she trying to say?'. When I got down here I called my
friend from the phone boot at the bottom, which was working, and she told me 'Get on a moto-taxi,

tell them to get off here and I will wait for you'. When I got there she was waiting for me and
everything was fine.
Me: Was that sign, was there a good reason to make that?
R: Until today I don't really know why she did the cross. I know that from 2004-2006 there were
conflicts with lots of dead. Since this is Zona Sul, Vidigal is close to Leblon, a few dead always appear
in the media, so people 2 years later in their heads still had that it was a very violent place.
Me: So your feeling about this place is that it was a favela, but now it's just... it's not?
R: No it's complicated. I remember now the message I got from Rosa about your thesis, and that she
said 'His thesis is that in 10 years this place won't be a favela any more'. So my first question was
'What is a favela?'. And I don't really know how to answer that. There are some things I think of but I
don't think there is an exact definition. It's something about the feeling of the population as well. For
example you can say people have to be poor and lower class, have problems with unemployment,
even in the origins of the community it was more shacks made of tree, little things, and the last ones
I saw where in the area of 25 where there are no more. There is no more drug trafficking, almost...
but I think a favela is more than that. For me... let me think about it... it's also a mixture of people
that live in the same area... it has a political side in people's attitude. A side like... everyone is united
more or less, united against the government. The enemy is the state. I don't know if this comes...
Maybe it comes more from drug trafficking, the origin of the drug faction was political so it was like
'Let's organise, since the state left us on the side and we are together. So let's see what we can do our
way without the government, and let not the government come here and get involved with us to help
us'. In this view Vidigal changed a lot. If it still is a favela or not... 
In conclusion. In Alto Vidigal parties are done by Karl and Germans. They are not from Vidigal, they
are not raised here, or Brazilian. Other parties that happened in the Casarão by the end of Rua 3, it
was also arranged by the other Germans, I don't even need to say their names. The Lamparina and
parties from Joé or Move!D, the money ... well, sometimes there are 1-2 that are involved who are
raised here in Vidigal, but the majority of the people making the parties is people that is not from
here, that weren't raised here. I am no judging, I am just saying. But I am kind of sorry that all this
profit it should go to the hands of people that were born here and got through many difficulties, who
are not taking advantage of the fame that Vidigal has, which is something Vidigal now has thanks to
them.

People from Vidigal don't realise that people with money are entering and are squeezing those that
don't have it. People without money are dumb, they are selling, they are selling. And the people with
money are going to do what? They are going to close it, to make gated condominiums with an amaz-
ing view, and only people with money are going to live here, who doesn't: [out!]. This is close to
Barra [da Tijuca], Saño Conrado. There are first class hotels, the Sheraton, only good hotels. Do you
think they want poor people living here? Of course not. Do you think the UPP came here to improve
things for us? Of course not. The UPP only came to maintain a project, to show the rich down there
that Vidigal has the capacity to welcome people, they are doing this slowly, people have to pay light,
pay this and that. People with a minimum wage can pay these things? No they can't pay water, light,
gas, internet, cable, they can't. People will be suffocated. If you can't pay and if you own a house that
is worth 50.000 and I tell you 'I give you 100.000', you are going to sell it. You are going to leave:
minus 1! I make a damn huge house. On the other side [of the road] 'Ah you sold to him? My house is
worth 100' and they give him 200. Pssstt [mimes someone departing with the hand]. Vidigal is like
this, and no one is noticing. People are thinking Vidigal is amazing, it's marvellous, they have shows.
Me: I was asking you before, if you know some of these foreigners, also outside this place, foreigners
and new Brazilians.
R: I do.
Me: OK, because you were talking about Oscar now
R: I know Oscar, there is Karl...There are many, I forget their names. There are many, but I always
forget their names.
Me: How do you know them?
R: I know them because they come here to the shop.
Me: OK, and what... are they customers, or they just come in to say 'Hi'...?
R: Some of them are clients. Some of them are. Some come buy a small thing for home. They don't
buy a lot, but they are still my friends.
Me: OK. How is the interaction with them? Is it easy to interact, or is it difficult, because there is a
cultural difference?
R: No no, it's easy for me to talk to the whole world, it's easy for me to make friends with everyone.
Every social class, it's easy to make friends. I'm like this, in every place and every day of my life.
Me: When people talk to me about this feeling of community, they also tell me that this is what
makes this place different than, for instance, Leblon.
R: What do you mean?
Me: When I ask people 'What is the difference between Vidigal and Leblon?', they tell me 'You know,
the difference is that here it's a community, you know your neighbours, people help each other...'
R: The difference is that in Leblon people live in apartments, they are neighbours, they don't even
say 'Hi' to each other. Here everyone is on top of each other, here you say 'Hi' to the neighbours, but
that's all they have here. The way of life and communicating here makes that people think 'Wow,
what humble people, what great people' - yeah, come and live here. Jessica: ask her, she will say 'Oh
Vidigal? I love Vidigal, wow Vidigal.' For her everything is new, she got here now, everything is new

for her.

Vidigal has always been looked upon as a better favela, also with the bad people that there here.
Fights... People always wanted to come here, but couldn't, because it was a dangerous area. You see
now that 30% is here in Vidigal. Why? Because it's one of the best favelas. Look in Rocinha if it's the
same. Maybe some, but it's not the same as in Vidigal. It's visited, it's pretty, new people as well here
in Vidigal, now the gringos. Is there anything better than having gringos coming here? No there is
not.
Me: I think it's interesting and I think it's... many people have told me that the prices have gone up
very much, and maybe there will even be the same prices as Leblon and Ipanema.
S: Yes that could happen. But in truth, it could happen but also could not happen. Let's say in 2020
or 2030 that we don't know if we will be leaving here or there, it can be that the people living here
will only be the people with money, and that the poor will come here only to work for them. We will
get there.
Me: Do you know anyone that has already sold and maybe left this place and gone someone else?
S: Many.
Me: Where did they go? Can you give an example of someone you know?
S: He sold... he left. He went back to his birthplace, Fortaleza. A gringo offered a considerable amount
that was enough to sustain himself back in his city and he sold. 
S: [Asking my translator Daniel] Did you live alone there?
D: I lived with a friend, because 800 it was a lot for me alone
S: But when you lived down there how much did you pay? I am making too many questions, it's be-
cause I never really had conversations with foreigners, it's the first time.

Me: Would you... who are you friends in here? Like foreigners, old-time residents, Brazilians, new
Brazilians?
T: Yeah it's all mixed, it's all mixed. I consider the guys from the Sitieé my friends. I even friends like
Leoén and some foreigners who came here. I even brought some foreigners in here, sometimes I'm
link 'Shit I've created a monster'.
Me: [Laughs] How so? Like how did you bring them in?
T: It was like some friends who were here or who I met, like this German guy whom I met once and I
thought he was nice and he thought about living here, visited me a couple of times, and I heard about
an apartment which was getting free there and he eneded up living there. But he was a very German,
very straight guy. Like the guy who's right but like too right to live in a community like this. If some-
body threw something on the street like a cigarette pack or something he went there and said 'Look,
you lost something, you dropped something' and he's like 'You should throw it in the trash', but
there is no trash not even in the streets, they don't have a street trash. Things like that. He would try
to educate people when they wrong, when someone throws their oil into the gutter and the mechan-
ic and he'd be like 'Yeah you shouldn't throw your oil into the gutter you know? You ruin our ground
water and our planet is dying' and shit. The guy doesn't want to hear about that. He doesn't want to
be lectured by some gringo about what he does, what he did all his life. Even if he's right, I'm like
'Yeah, leave the people alone', and he was like 'Look at that girl why can she wear this tight dress this
chubby girl. It's horrible how she dresses up, she's not an ugly girl but why does it she dress herself
up like a prostitute'. And I'm like 'Leave her be!'. She doesn't wanna hear that, because I think that
generally people here are more [humble], they don't think of themselves as being so important, be-
cause they have always been told they were inferior people, so they are very shy and modest. I think
they feel, not threatened but they feel a little bit intimidated by gringos, because gringos have trav-
elled the world. Only to be here they have already travelled the world. And they come from Gringo-
land where everything works, they all speak 2-3 languages, they all speak English. So they are
already one step back, they already think they are... like a little bit... they feel a little bit inferior
maybe, they have this little inferiority complex. When you come to them and even try to lecture
them they are already with their back against the wall, don't know how they are gonna react, 'I don't
wanna hear it! Fuck off! Leave me alone' or whatever because they don't have the solution for that.
They can't change their ways from one day to another, so that's a little conflict, so I'd say 'Don't push
them with their backs against the wall'.
And the gringos like it, the gringos.... We have a cooperation with the Erasmus program, they said
'Yeah they want to go to favela parties'. Usually it's funk parties but the gringos are usually a bit lost
in the funk parties. Because for me at least I don't like the music so much, it's not something I can
dance to and have fun all night with. It's fun to look at, but it's more like a freak show than a party I
relax, I have fun, I make new friends or something like that. That's not the case in our party. It's fun
and you can make friends and it's the music you are used to, you like to dance to, it's more accessible
than the baile funk. Nothing against the baile funk, it's not my kind of thing.

The interview is conducted in English.
Me: And when you came here, like... did you move to Vidigal right away, or have you been living oth-
er places before moving here?
T: Well, I moved here right away pretty much. I [stayed] two weeks at a house of a friend at Ilha da
Gigoya in Barra da Tijuca. Which was pretty interesting because they were really living the middle-
class life, the Brazilian middle-class life, with all the luxury, [privileges] they have you know? Car,
better electricity, and house and everything that comes together there. But then I was looking all the
time for a place to stay and I consciously chose Vidigal then, instead of any other small room more
down town.
Me: And this is one a half months ago then, or two... ?
T: Yeah, that's one and a half months ago.
Me: Why did you say that you consciously chose it? Like... was it a cultural choice, an economical
choice, location...
T: All of it pretty much. I could have found probably an appropriate room in the concrete city, as I
call it. Well it's pretty much concrete too, but... well more, I say down town now, even if it's not
Centro. But it was more expensive, so in one way it was economically, and, yeah the main reason was
pretty much cultural: I didn't want to stay somewhere where I am absolutely anonymous. So I
thought something like an ex-favela, 'cause Vidigal is not really the favela any more, in the sense of
the word. Yes because it's different lifestyle here. I like the idea of being in a tighter community
somehow. Yeah, maybe not... because I was clear about the fact that there is not really, not like a vil-
lage community here or something, but more closer together than somewhere down town where
people just live in the same house for coincidence. I like the cultural point of it too, pretty much. I
was interested in those dynamics too, like how those quarters develop, how people live together also
with the new middle-class moving into here and all the gringos. There was... and it's so much nicer
here!
Me: What did you know about this before you moved in?
T: Well I had heard a lot when I was researching about Rio and the pacification in 2006 and all the
stuff that went on, of course I heard about Vidigal too. Since it's a rather popular artist favela too,
there was more online to find than about yeah I don't know, any of the other margin favelas of Rio.
So I knew something at least. I knew that there would probably a bit... that this would probably be a
bit more liberate, or free place for someone like me that doesn't come from the community origin-
ally, than Pedreira, for example, or whatever favela on the margin, where you still can't really be on
the road with a good feeling even at daytime, as somewhere who doesn't belong to the people there. 
Me: Now you have been here for like one and half month. What do you like of this place then Like,
you obviously mentioned a few of these things, but if you had to, if you had to explain to someone

who is not from here and has never been there, while you are living here, what would you say?
T: Well, I'd probably say somehow you get closer to what's life for average life in Brazil is like. Still
knowing that Vidigal is already a rather big exception from other favelas, like really favelas. There is
a lot of reasons: it's the sight, it's the climate, and pretty much the feeling that you are more part of
the majority's life in Brazil than in Leblon in Ipanema or somewhere.
Me: So it has a more real, authentic
T: [Interrupts] It's more authentic yeah, and for that reason alone I would prefer it.
T: I was inviting them [friends from Barra da Tijuca] for dinner or something at my place here in Vi-
digal at it somehow never worked out, but I met them in between for whatever other reason is down
town, parties, even just sitting at a bar and having a beer, which we could have done perfectly here
too and paid lower price or whatever. You know? That's stuff like that really. Yeah... What else? I
don't know, people just lead their everyday fights with the not perfect infrastructural condition here.
And as everybody knows that's what the majority in Brazil does, and that keeps you rather closer to
the like, maybe problems or the issues of a society like Brazil. Yeah that so much is getting better
here now and the middle-class is growing and growing and economically it's a rather wealthy coun-
try, but not half of the society really has benefits of that development. And living with energy cuts if
it starts raining, and stuff like that, it is normal to everybody here as in most other parts of Brazil
probably.
Me: That's interesting... 
T: And that makes it more authentic then, because if your house has an energy cut too, then you get
into feeling how it is if you suddenly can't use your internet but you actually had the plan to do it. Or
if you are not reading like normally before you go to sleep, but you have to use a candle or a torch or
whatever. And, it's stuff like that. What do you do if the energy is cut? It's just a situation that, yeah
it's very... puts you back to another level of existence, very much. Because it's such a basic need.
Same stuff like the water, the water supply here. If you know that you have just a certain amount of
water before the water gets pumped up again, then you start changing your habits wile doing the
dishes, or washing your hands, because you know that if you want to have a shower tomorrow and
it's doing 35 degrees, then you better watch out not to use much water today, and that changes your
life in very small parts but it changes it, and the conscious about everything you have towards life.
Me: If you had to sort of say who your friends are, would you say you have more friends in Vidigal or
outside?
T: Outside.
Me: Outside?
T:  Yeah, and I don't like that so much, but I was, already pretty positive, or no I was sure that it
would be like that too. I know that from... I had experienced that in Africa already: that it's just not as
easy to come close to the people than to people that live in more or less the same, with the back-
ground as you do, like middle-class. I mean Germany is a huge, big middle-class society. Some so-
called lower class to but that is, compared to here, it's not existing. I mean I am not from a very
wealthy household in Germany, I would actually call myself not really in the middle-class, but some-

where lower. But I had, I used all the privileges of someone who lives in Germany. I studied, I did
school for ages. I was travelling whenever I could, stuff like that. It's much more harder to get close
to people that didn't have those privileges. Ther are some levels where I am getting close to the
people, for example playing soccer or if I am having a drink and I'm just talking to someone.
Me: In the beginning we were talking about the fact that like there is this feeling of community here.
I have an idea about what community is, but sometimes it is a bit difficult to grasp what it means in
the everyday life. Could you define what it means for you, like how you would explain it to someone
who doesn't live here?
T: Well, the specific community I am talking about when I'm talking about vidigal in comparison to
any other communities, because of course you have a community in leblon and everywhere else in
the world too. But the difference is more town or villagey feeling. That people know more of each
other and want to know more of each other.
T: Pacification in Vidigal was not really easy going on and some of the people of course have the feel-
ing that they suffered for something that other people benefit from now, if they come and just take
over the favela somehow.
Me: Yeah, and you mean, here you mean the Brazilians or the gringos or...
T: I think that the Brazilians, the like, the majority of Brazilians that move here don't have such, well
they know of course what happened here, but it doesn't mean as much to them as it maybe does to
the gringos that are more sensible about where they go to. Especially the one that come to Vidigal
and not the ones that book their three weeks of summer holidays in Rio de Janeiro at Copacabana.
So yeah, the gringos that come here, mostly have I think, are sensible to the fact that they live togeth-
er with a lot of people that aren't as privileged as them. And the Brazilians they don't have abso-
lutely problems, they don't have problems with stuff like that. For example getting … getting the
neighbour to clean their house for some money.
Me: Have you ever encountered this?
T: Uh?
Me: Have you met this thing?
T: Yeah yeah.
Me: Can you tell me, try to tell me about this example?
T: Nah, I just met with a Brazilian guy that I know here, that is not from Vidigal, I met another per-
son that moved here too some one year ago or something. And we sat at the table and they were go-
ing on about, if they do their houses themselves or if they get someone for cleaning, and then he told
very openly that he asked his neighbour and that she can use all the money she can get and she does
stuff like that all day anyway and has no other job and she is absolutely glad about the fact that she
can earn money with that. And that's true of course, that's good too for her probably and for him in a
way but I wouldn't feel comfortable with the fact that my neighbour was cleaning my house.
