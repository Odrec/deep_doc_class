Exercise 1

The Role of Research in Psychology, Part IV: The problems of generalisation and decision-making in
research: Chance findings and sample size

• Overview

◦ In psychology: Generalisation because striving for universalism

▪ BUT: How to draw the limits to whether a finding is universal/can be replicated or was just

a matter of chance?! → sampling procedures and statistical significance

◦ Psychological research is concerned with samples of people rather than with individuals

◦ Problem with sample population: usually just most convenient population (e.g. Psy students) →

no random sampling from specified population (sample population biased)

◦ generalisation: universalism = assumption that behavioral effects found in experiments are the

same for all people → “no need for ensuring that sample is representative”

▪ → overgeneralization?!

◦ statistical analysis = “how safe” is it to generalize from a given sample data set to all people?

◦ General  procedure:  Assume that the H0 was true and then comparing found data to effect

claimed by H0

◦ With an alpha = 5  percent:  the  probability of a finding being due to chance when the null
hypothesis is in fact true is 5 times out of 100, or less. Results that meet this criterion are called
statistically significant, otherwise they are statistically non-significant

◦ sample size is important (the bigger → the more likely that statistically significant)

•

Introduction

◦ Are we justified to make more general claims about findings of our research beyond research

itself?

◦ Three themes:

▪ lack of limitations placed on generalisation by the universalism of psychological theory.

▪ limitations placed on generalisation by the sampling methods used.

▪ limitations placed on generalisation by the structures of statistical significance testing.

◦ issues such as the generalisability of data are really aspects of process of decision-making that a

researcher makes throughout their research

• Universalism

◦ characteristic of psychology: tendency towards universalism

◦ universalism: The principles of psychology will not vary; psychological findings will apply
anywhere to anybody irrespective of social status, culture... → finding is true of all people
(there are exceptions: in rare cases, it's implied that findings are only for a certain population)
“psychological principles = laws of human nature”

◦ historically: also generalisation from animals to humans (Pavlov, Skinner)

◦ only recently: critique on universalism

◦ Nowadays: psychologists likely to be aware of the problem but, nevertheless, this awareness is
not built into their practices for designing their research studies: Universalism operates covertly

•

Sampling and generalisation

◦ Many   criticisms   have   been   made   of   psychology   for   its   restricted   approach   to   sampling

(“psychological research = psychology of psychology students”)

◦ How big should a sample be to allow for generalisability?

◦ How should samples be selected in order to allow for generalisability?

◦ There is a variability (differences between people and within people) between all individuals:

→ need for statistics and sampling designs

◦ sample size partially dependent on possible consequences of research 

◦ larger samples are more likely to demonstrate a trend in the study if there is one in reality →

psychologists believe that this is likely to result in greater precision in their estimates

◦ sample size depends on whether we simply want to find if two parameters correlate/have a

relationship or if we want to find the exact/”true” size of that relationship

◦ convenience samples = not random samples of groups of people that are relatively easy for the

researcher to get to take part in their study
▪ most find this acceptable for majority of psychological research
▪ but some argue that this procedure is presumptious

◦ universalism = psychologist's tendency to generalise beyond the population which would be

defined by the research sample.
▪ At what time should generalisation stop?!
▪ distinction between the  

 population of interest  
 

 
sample of participants

 and the population defined clearly by the

▪ appropriateness of sampling methods?!

◦ randomisation is used it is in the form of random allocation to the conditions of an experiment

or the sequence of taking part in the conditions BUT not for random sampling

◦ Random sampling is considerably undermined by poor participation rates (Participation rates refer to

the proportion of people who take part in the research compared with the number asked to take part in the research)

◦ Systematic errors!!! by unappropriate sampling methods/not random samples

•

Statistics and generalisation

◦ Statistical techniques help researchers explore patterns in their data

◦ A statistically significant finding is one that is large enough that it is unlikely to be caused by

chance fluctuations/noise

◦ convention: alpha = 5 percent level : finding as big as ours can be expected to occur by chance
on 5 or fewer occasions if we tested that finding on 100 occasions (assuming that the null
hypothesis is in fact true)

◦ A finding or effect that is likely to occur on more than 5 out of 100 times by chance is described

as being statistically non-significant or not statistically significant

◦ Statistical significance testing merely refers to the question whether the trend is sufficiently
large in the data so that it is unlikely that it could be the result of chance factors due to the
variability inherent in sampling, that is, there is little chance that the null hypothesis of no trend
or difference is correct

◦ larger sample → higher probability to get significant results (very few H0 are true when dealing

with large samples)

◦ the critical value of 5 per cent or .05 or less is an arbitrary cut-off point, BUT nevertheless one

widely accepted

◦ more conservative alpha: smaller than 0.05
◦ more liberal: bigger than 0.05

• Directional and non-directional hypotheses (again)

◦ Researchers usually have an idea as to what the outcome of their experiments is or at least in

what direction the effect/trend is going

▪ → often research hypotheses are expressed in a directional form 

◦ Research works best when the researcher articulates coherent, factually based and convincing

grounds for their expectations

◦ Difference between basic hypotheses/expectations/assumptions and STATISTICAL hypotheses
◦ for   directional  statistical  hypotheses  there  must   be   strong  and   convincing  empirical   and/or
theoretical evidence in order for a directional hypothesis to be offered (plus researchers must be
ignorant of their data before making the prediction)
▪ very exacting requirements
▪ one-tailed significance testing
▪ a directional hypothesis is supported by weaker data than would be required by the non-

directional hypothesis (5% all on one side and not split to 2 x 2,5%)
•

The only good justification for accepting a weaker trend is that there is good reason to think that
it is correct

◦ in non-directional hypothesis-testing: 5% is split in positive and negative direction 
◦ main   assumption   of   hypothesis-testing:   given   that   the   null   hypothesis   is   true:   what's   the

probability of obtaining each of the possible outcomes (by possible sampling)

•

Similarity between measures of effect and association

◦ most   common   statistical   analysis   techniques   include   the   t-test   and   the   Pearson   correlation

coefficient

◦ t-tests: either calculate the standard error of the mean and or the standard error of the difference

between two means (mean(s) relative to the variability in the data)

▪ the bigger t, the bigger the effect (in order to be significant: t must be bigger than 2.00)

◦ the Pearson’s correlation shows the size of an association between two quantitative variables (it
varies from -1 to 1) (association between two quantitative variables)(=point biserial correlation)

◦ there is an interchangeability of the concepts of correlation and tests of difference (t-tests):

▪   we can speak of a difference between two groups or alternatively of a correlation or an

association between group membership and another variable

•

Sample size and size of association

◦ how big should a sample  be in order to see whether an effect or association is statistically

significant?

◦ The bigger the correlation is, the smaller can the sample be, for the effect to be significant
◦ size of an association/correlation can be described in words and in numbers
◦ coefficient   of   determination   =   squared   correlation   value   (proportion   of   the   variation   in   a

variable that is shared with the variation in another variable.)

◦ it is helpful to consider the amount of variation explained by a correlation and not simply the

numerical size → to what extent does a certain variable explain a particular kind of behavior 

◦ we   should   be  cautious   about  the   routine  application   of  labels  to  correlations   or  any  other
research   result   →   measures   are   not   perfectly  reliable   or   valid   measures   of   what   they  are
measuring → usually to underestimate the true or real size of the association

◦ correction for attenuation: simple statistical procedure for taking into account the unreliability

of the measures

◦ how make up mind on what association/effect to find?

▪ Previous research
▪ small pilot study prior to actual study (can calculate number of participants needed to make

trend in pilot study significant)

▪ decide what size of relationship/effect is of interest (very small effects are significant in very

large samples)

◦ purely   statistical   approaches   to   generalisation   of   research   findings   are   something   of   an
impossibility → it's a decision-making process and the researcher needs to keep in mind a
number of factors (such as the nature of the sampling, the adequacy of each of the measures
taken, and an assessment of the value or worth of the findings for the purpose for which they
were intended)
