Question to the article “Moral 
Transhumanism”   

in: Persson/Savulescu , Journal of Medicine and Philosophy,35, pp. 656-669 

The authors mention the problem that the humans who are to be made being more morally are the 
ones who should take a “morally wise” decision how to do so. I think it is difficult to lead rather 
immoral persons to take moral enhancing biomedication without either manipulating them 
psychologically (e.g by mass media) or administering the medication without their knowledge (e.g 
adding morally acting substances to the industrial food chain). Both seem to be immoral to me, as 
they undermine the principle of free choice of the individual. Although a consequentialist could 
argue that for the sake of a more moral world in total this could be justified. In my opinion a good 
aim does not justify immoral means.  

The further, one principle of transhumanism (which gives the context for biomedication in the article 
of consideration) is that the technologies should give the the possibility to improve oneself in a self-
determined manner and without being forced (see 
http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanismus#Technologie_und_Moral „Die Technologien sollen es jedem Menschen 
ermöglichen, seine Lebensqualität nach Wunsch zu verbessern, sein Aussehen sowie seine physikalischen und seelischen 
Möglichkeiten selbst bestimmen zu können. Niemand solle zu irgendeiner Veränderung gezwungen werden.”) which 
stands in contrast to being unconsciously made a “better” being by the means stated above 
conducted by the state or another institution or individual. 

Thus I wonder, how the change in human moral consciousness proposed by the authors should be 
made without acting immorally oneselves.
