BASIS UND ÜBERBAU [BASE AND 

SUPERSTRUCTURE]

In der gesellschaftlichen Produktion ihres Lebens gehen 
die Menschen bestimmte notwendige von ihrem Willen 
unabhängige Verhältnisse ein, Produktionsverhältnisse, die 
einer bestimmten Entwicklungsstufe ihrer materiellen 
Produktivkräfte entsprechen. Die Gesamtheit dieser 
Produktionsverhältnisse bildet die ökonomische Struktur 
der Gesellschaft, die reale Basis, worauf sich ein juristischer 
und politischer Überbau erhebt, und welcher bestimmte 
gesellschaftliche Bewusstseinsformen entsprechen. Die 
Produktionsweise des materiellen Lebens bedingt den 
sozialen, politischen und geistigen Lebensprozess 
überhaupt. Es ist nicht das Bewusstsein der Menschen, 
das ihr Sein, sondern umgekehrt ihr gesellschaftliches 
Sein, das ihr Bewusstsein bestimmt.
