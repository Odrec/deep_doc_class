1 Introduction
(cid:140)is cheat sheet is intended to help you organise and write academic text in an organised way.
However, this requires some knowledge about principle concepts and rules of academic writing.
Hence, the following advice provides procedural instructions that guide you through the initial
steps of preparing, structuring, writing and editing your academic text.

2 Formulate your topic and the most relevant issues
Brie(cid:131)y sketch out your research topic, concept, methods, results and, if applicable suggestions for
further research. (cid:140)e purpose of this is to formulate your thoughts about the research topic in
summary form. (cid:140)is approach forces you to put your core idea in words and helps you to focus.
Furthermore, this condensed version of your ideas is the basis for your abstract, which will be
wri(cid:138)en when your writing e(cid:130)ort is complete.

3 Structure
(cid:140)e next step is to sketch out your structure or skeleton including some main functions of your
article, e.g. introduction, hypothesis, research questions, problem formulation, literature research,
methodology, results, uncertainties, discussion, outlook for further research, etc..

3.1 Functions and sections
(cid:140)e design of functions and sections may be accomplished with the following steps:

1. Write down all (!) of the functions that you want to include in your text in the same sequence

that you wish them to recur in the (cid:128)nal version of your text.

2. Write down key words, text snippets, thoughts and ideas in an as yet informal way. (cid:140)e

result should be that each of the functions should has some text with the main ideas.
