1. Perception task
2. Reading comprehension task

Instructions:

➔ Familiarize yourselves with the following description 

of a person. Afterwards you will have to answer 
questions about the paragraph.

24

Donald spent a great amount of his time in search of what he liked to call 
excitement. He had already climbed Mt. McKinley, shot the Colorado rapids 
in a kyack, driven in a demolition derby, and piloted a jet-powered boat--
without  knowing  very  much  about  boats.  He  had  risked  injury,  and  even 
death,  a  number  of  times.  Now  he  was  in  search  of  new  excitement.  He 
was  thinking,  perhaps,  he  would  do  some  skydiving  or  maybe  cross  the 
Atlantic  in  a  sailboat.  By  the  way  he  acted  one  could  readily  guess  that 
Donald  was  well  aware  of  his  ability  to  do  many  things  well.  Other  than 
business engagements, Donald's contacts with people were rather limited. 
He felt he didn't really need to rely on anyone. Once Donald made up his 
mind to do something it was as good as done no matter how long it might 
take or how difficult the going might be. Only rarely did he change his mind 
even when it might well have been better if he had.

25

Questions

➔ Please answer each question with a single word.

● Considering only Donald's attitude towards contacts with other 

people, how might one characterize this aspect of his 
personality?

● Considering only Donald's attitude towards outdoor activities, 

how might one characterize this aspect of his personality?

● Considering only Donald's attitude towards himself, how might 

one characterize this aspect of his personality?

I. Emergence of Priming Research

28

Introduction - The very beginnings

She is a cold person.

She is a warm person.

➔ An experimenter’s verbal description of a stimulus can 
affect how that stimulus is remembered and evaluated
e.g. Kelley, 1950

29

Social cognition and priming

● Higgins et al. (1977): Category accessibility and 

impression formation.

Goals:
➔ Test the influence of category activation on the 

categorization and evaluation of a stimulus person

➔ Avoid the problem of experimenter demand effects

30

The experiment

1. Perception task
2. Reading comprehension task

60 subjects, 6 verbal exposure conditions:

Positive trait words

Negative trait words

❏ Applicable - Overt

❏ Applicable - Overt

❏ Applicable - No Overt

❏ Applicable - No Overt

❏ Nonapplicable - Overt

❏ Nonapplicable - Overt

31

Results

1) Characterization of the stimulus person: Subjects used 

trait categories (not terms!) that were previously 
activated when the categories were applicable

2) Evaluation of the stimulus person: Delayed evaluation 

was in accordance with the previously activated trait 
categories (but only when the categories were 
applicable); immediate evaluation was not

3) Stimulus reproduction: No effect of trait category 

activation

32

II. Classification of Priming Research 

33

Different forms of priming

● The previous study inspired many other studies on 

priming effects in social cognition

➔ Wentura & Rothermund (2014): Important to 

distinguish different forms of priming

➔ Differentiation has theoretical (and practical) 

implications

34

Necessary distinctions

Long-term priming

Short-term priming

Between-participants design: 
Experimental vs. control 
condition

Within-participants design:
Related vs. unrelated 
condition

Time scale of priming effects:
Minutes to days or weeks 

Time scale of priming effects: 
Fractions of a second, 
maximally a few seconds

35

Short-term priming

Response priming
Task is to categorize the 
target’s valence

➔ The prime either matches 

or mismatches the 
response

Confound:
● S-S compatibility
● S-R compatibility

36

Semantic priming
Task is completely 
independent of the stimulus 
variation

No confound: 
● S-S compatibility

Long-term semantic priming

● Semantic priming with a longer delay than usual

● Works best with complex semantic tasks that require 

high cognitive processing

● Possible explanation: Long-term changes in memory 
as a result of learning, knowledge becomes activated 
only when it is needed (Hughes & Whittlesea, 2003)

➔ Analogy to long-term priming in social cognition

37

III. Subliminal Priming

“Drink coca-cola, eat popcorn, and choose powerade: 

testing the limits of subliminal persuasion”

38

Subliminal Priming
● subliminal priming = present people single words or images at a 

speed that is below the conscious threshold
● words/images → activation of people’s knowledge, beliefs, 

stereotypes or cognitions

● cognitions → capable of influencing individuals’ attitudes, choices 

& behaviors under the right conditions

● right conditions → primed topic compatible with individuals’ 

current need states, motivations or goals

● subliminal persuasion = subliminally presented stimuli have some 

effect on individuals’ attitudes or behaviors

● interested parties = marketing and advertising scholars & 

psychologists 

39

Former Subliminal Priming Research
● Cuperfain and Clarke (1985): mixed results whether 

subliminal stimuli are capable of affecting brand 
preferences: significant effect only for established brand

● Hawkins (1970): increased thirst ratings afterwards

● Beatty and Hawkins (1989): failed replication, due to type I 

error or too short time of presenting

● Strahan (2002): significant subliminal priming effect for 

thirsty participants and thirst-related subliminal primes (= 
goal-relevant prime)

40

Former Subliminal Priming Research
● Karremans (2006): (primes = Lipton Ice Tea vs. neutral 
Npeic Tol; choices = Lipton Ice Tea vs. Spa Rood Water) 
ordinary thirst condition and induced thirst condition → 
thirstier participants more affected by Lipton Ice Tea prime 
than non-thirsty or neutral primed  

?

● Bermeitinger (2009): significant effect also for the 

condition of brand choice but hypothetical brands (far 
easier!)

41

The Goals

● how long last subliminal prime effects? 
● which opportunities to make a real choice of brands?

1 testing the boundaries of prior priming 
research by creating more ecologically 
valid conditions & 
2 demonstrating the limits of subliminal 
priming effects 

    GOALS

42

The Studies

Study 1

 =   replication of Karremans’ study

- brand-selection choices in a simulated 

shopping environment 
- shortly after the prime

- brand-selection choices in a simulated 

shopping environment 

- after a 15-min delay

Study 2

Study 3

43

Study 1

Procedure 124 undergraduates, 

2 priming conditions: Powerade (second-tier 
brand of sports drink) vs. Drawepoe (neutral),
pretended visual detection task, 
23 ms of presentation,  
25 strings, 
separate test to guess the primed word, 
3 more tasks: rating brands on their thirst-
quenching properties (Coca-Cola, Powerade, 
Gatorade), rating present level of thirst, 
indicating intentions to drink these brands

Drawepoe

44

Study 1

Results

45

two-way ANOVA (IV: Powerade vs. 
Drawepoe, low vs. high thirst, DV: intentions 
to drink Powerade)  
→ 2 significant main effects & significant 
interaction (no significant effect of prime on 
thirst & no significant interaction for the 
other brands) = replication
“Subliminal Priming enhanced intentions to 
drink a familiar lower market share brand, 
Powerade, over a more powerful competitor, 
only for thirsty participants.“

Study 2

Procedure 

46

98 undergraduates, 
thirst manipulation: participants of high-
thirst condition → evaluate Ms. Vickie‘s 
potato chips, participants of low-thirst 
condition → evaluate Propel bottled water, 
pretended visual detection task, 
3 more tasks: rating present level of thirst, 
rating thirst-quenching properties of brands 
(Gatorade, Powerade, Propel, Coca-Cola), 
rating familiarity with these brands, 
reward for participation: 1 beverage of choice 
& 2 snacks from a simulated grocery → 
recording beverage choice

Study 2

Results

47

logistic regression (IV: exposure to the 
brand prime, thirst, DV: brand choice)
→ significant main effect of thirst on 
choice of Powerade & significant 
interaction between presence of prime 
& thirst on choice of Powerade
critical question: are thirsty and non-
thirsty participants differently affected?
“Subliminal Priming was effective in 
driving consumer choice behavior, in 
particular when participants’ need-to-
drink goal was activated.”

Study 3

Procedure

Results

48

138 undergraduates,
same procedure as study 2 but brand 
choice task after a 15-min delay,
same manipulation

same logistic regression (IV: exposure to 
the brand prime, thirst, DV: brand 
choice)
→ no significant effect of subliminal 
prime on choice of Powerade & no 
significant interaction between presence 
of prime & thirst on choice of Powerade
→ but significant effect of thirst on 
choice of Powerade

Study 3

49

Results

“The thirst manipulation affected the 
choice of Powerade, but neither the 
subliminal prime nor the interaction 
between prime and thirst had significant 
effects on participants’ choice of 
Powerade when a 15-min delay was 
introduced.”

Discussion of Subliminal Priming

Group Work 

50

Discussion of Subliminal Priming

● Group 1: How to evaluate these findings in the light of 

the suggested classification of priming research by  
Wentura & Rothermund?

● Group 2: Do you think that subliminal priming can 
influence consumer choice behavior under actual 
marketplace conditions? 

● Group 3: Do you have any idea how to keep on 

examining long-term subliminal priming?
