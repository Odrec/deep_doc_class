ABSTRACT Clostridium difﬁcile infection is one of the most common health care-associated infections, and up to 40% of patients
suffer from recurrence of disease following standard antibiotic therapy. Recently, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has
been successfully used to treat recurrent C. difﬁcile infection. It is hypothesized that FMT aids in recovery of a microbiota capa-
ble of colonization resistance to C. difﬁcile. However, it is not fully understood how this occurs. Here we investigated changes in
the fecal microbiota structure following FMT in patients with recurrent C. difﬁcile infection, and imputed a hypothetical func-
tional proﬁle based on the 16S rRNA proﬁle using a predictive metagenomic tool. Increased relative abundance of Bacteroidetes
and decreased abundance of Proteobacteria were observed following FMT. The fecal microbiota of recipients following trans-
plantation was more diverse and more similar to the donor proﬁle than the microbiota prior to transplantation. Additionally, we
observed differences in the imputed metagenomic proﬁle. In particular, amino acid transport systems were overrepresented in
samples collected prior to transplantation. These results suggest that functional changes accompany microbial structural
changes following this therapy. Further identiﬁcation of the speciﬁc community members and functions that promote coloniza-
tion resistance may aid in the development of improved treatment methods for C. difﬁcile infection.
IMPORTANCE Within the last decade, Clostridium difﬁcile infection has surpassed other bacterial infections to become the lead-
ing cause of nosocomial infections. Antibiotic use, which disrupts the gut microbiota and its capability in providing colonization
resistance against C. difﬁcile, is a known risk factor in C. difﬁcile infection. In particular, recurrent C. difﬁcile remains difﬁcult
to treat with standard antibiotic therapy. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has provided a successful treatment method
for some patients with recurrent C. difﬁcile infection, but its mechanism and long-term effects remain unknown. Our results
provide insight into the structural and potential metabolic changes that occur following FMT, which may aid in the development
of new treatment methods for C. difﬁcile infection.

Clostridium difﬁcile infection (CDI) is the leading cause of

health care-associated diarrhea, and rates of CDI have signif-
icantly increased during the past decade (1). It is estimated that
there are more than 500,000 cases of CDI in the United States
annually, and estimates of the ﬁnancial burden attributed to CDI
range from $1.3 billion to $3.4 billion (2, 3). The manifestations of
CDI can range from cramps, diarrhea, and colitis potentially to
more severe outcomes, including toxic megacolon and death (1).
Of signiﬁcant concern is the rate of recurrence following an initial
CDI episode; 20 to 40% of patients do not resolve their infection
following standard CDI treatment (metronidazole or vancomy-
cin) and experience a recurrence of disease, which is associated
with increased morbidity and mortality (1, 4). Once recurrence
has occurred, the risk of subsequent recurrences is increased fur-
ther (5).

The gut microbiota plays an important part on the pathogen-
esis of CDI. A healthy gut microbiota is thought to limit coloniza-

tion by pathogens, a function of the microbiota known as coloni-
zation resistance. A major risk factor for CDI is antibiotic use,
which disrupts the normal structure of the gut microbiota and
leads to the loss of colonization resistance (6). The difﬁculty in
acquiring patient samples prior to the development of CDI has
limited the identiﬁcation of speciﬁc members of the microbiota
that are capable of providing colonization resistance against CDI
in humans. While it is hypothesized that recurrent CDI occurs due
to the inability of the indigenous microbiota to recover following
antibiotic use (7), it is still unknown whether a speciﬁc microbial
community is more prone to recurrence than others. Comparison
of the fecal microbiota in patients developing nosocomial diar-
rhea with and without C. difﬁcile colonization revealed few com-
munity differences to indicate speciﬁc community structures sus-
ceptible to CDI (8), although prior studies have demonstrated that
a small number of patients with recurrent CDI exhibited a unique
microbiota community structure (9). More than likely, the struc-
