Meeting: 3/7/2014 

CONCERNS: 

  Decision Making how to make brief test booklet for base rate fallacy, etc? 
  Memory I: difficult to design the experiment. To form city lists that associate in size similarly, taking 

into account the number of trials for each EEG session. 
Social cognition & Bias: Unclear research question. Possible problems with Ethics Board 

 

POINTS TO REMEMBER: 

  Account for running EEG pilot study first as well 
 

find good correlation btw EEG and behavioural response 
PPI toolbox for EEG, psycho-physiological interaction to measure data. Still a larger group needed for 
predictions, but variety of behaviour needed not variety of subjects (similar to fMRI correlation 
method) 
keep it short but get good data 
subject behaviour variance instead of 2 separate group variation.  

 

 

 

 

  Aim to keep number of subjects to 16-20 
 

consider time constraints, setup+experiment should not be more than 2 hours. 
a lot of conditions could lead to difficulty in analysing the variables later. 

CONSOLIDATION OF TOPICS: 

Stereotype bias:  lot of literature, finding good research topic difficult. 

Achziger et al. Base rate:   -clarify group problem on how to differentiate 

 

 

-why posterior condition has importance? 

- can we influence prior <--> posterior selection? 

Memory:   

-relate with psycho-physiological interaction possibly relate resting time 

-resting state: Risky, new 

Explicit/Implicit knowledge:  

-DM + memory doable, related 

-prediction whether implicit explicit knowledge used for DM 

-study LRP for time course of top down control in bias control and impl/expl DM 

-top down modulation of implicit processes 

Task:  

-read Achziger 2010.  And make up mind on 2 topics (highlighted). 

-investigate imp/expl knowledge influence on DM 

Group meeting at 6pm on Tuesday 8/7/14, 1800 hr at Villa 

Next meeting with Martens on Friday 11/7/14, 1200hr, location: TBA on Studip
