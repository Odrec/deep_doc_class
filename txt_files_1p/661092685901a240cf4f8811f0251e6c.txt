Today we are going to learn how to use the PsychToolbox (http://psychtoolbox.org/) to pro-

gram and control experiments.
We want to implement a simple version of the famous posner-cueing task. Before we start, a
simple and short introduction how to use Psychtoolbox.
The usage of this toolbox is a little bit different than other toolboxes. There are some main functions
e.g. screen. These functions have many sub-functions. E.g. screen(’OpenWindow’), screen(’Flip’),
screen(’DrawText’)...
To get an overview over a function, simply write »screen. To get extended help to sub-functions
write »screen(’Flip?’). In the current geruest, you ﬁnd some important deﬁnition of sub-functions
and functions of Psychtoolbox we will use in this experiment.

Short description of the posner cuing task:
• The subject has to ﬁxate the center of the screen
• For the cue-condition a cue appears left or right from ﬁxation cross
• After that the target appears on the left or right side

– Either without cue
– On the same side as the cue
– On the opposing side for an incorrect cue

• The time the subject takes to press either left or right is measures

In the posner cueing task it can often be observed that subjects react faster with a congruent cue,
than an incogruent or absent cue. We want to replicate these results.

1 Task (basic): Posner Cuing Task

Implement the posner cueing task. Use (Ntrials = 120). Use 2
congruent cue.
