CHAPTER  12

Power and racism

P. J. Henry
Felicia Pratto

This chapter examines the relationship between the social psychological 

conceptualizations of power and of racism, and outlines how research 
on racism can benefit from incorporating the understanding of power pro-
cesses at the intergroup level. Until recently, the social psychology litera-
tures on power and racism developed largely independently (for an excep-
tion  see  Operario  &  Fiske,  1998).  Before  presenting  our  analysis  of  the 
relationship between racism and power, we provide theoretical definitions 
of these constructs. Social psychologists have rarely explicitly defined rac-
ism (for an exception, see Jones, 1997), despite their considerable attention 
to prejudice, discrimination, and stereotyping of racial and ethnic groups. 
Rather, they either rely on colloquial meanings or have defined particular 
varieties of racism (e.g., symbolic racism, modern racism, aversive racism, 
institutionalized  racism).  Hence,  we  begin  by  defining  racism.  Then  we 
summarize how power is defined and used in social psychological research, 
and find that current practices are not adequate for encompassing our defi-
nition of racism. The remainder of the chapter reexamines extant theories 
of racial prejudice and beliefs through the lens of power. We argue that by 
incorporating a broader definition of power, research on racism can more 
fully understand the effects of intergroup power on phenomena recognized 
as racist.
